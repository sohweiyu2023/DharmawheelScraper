It's a correction without an error to correct.

But my point really is that Yogacāra offers much more of a narratology than Madhyamaka. It's loaded with many more concepts, fine distinctions, and path narratives than Mādhyamikas typically offer. 

There just isn't much juice for the POMO scene to squeeze out of Madhyamaka. Madhyamaka is more akin to ordinary language philosophy than anything else in the Western scene.

And this relates directly to why Madhyamaka isn't a challenge to conventional knowledge, unlike deconstruction and other post-modernist trends, for which it is consistently mistaken. 

Madhyamaka, if anything, does not seek to dismantle conventional knowledge, so much as site it appropriately in the context of liberation. It makes strong arguments against incoherent, essentialist claims which undermine conventional knowledge, in order to show that knowledge requires functionality in order to be considered knowledge at all. Its appeal to the illusory nature of phenomena and knowledge is not an argument for pure subjectivity, as it is often mistaken for. Instead, its appeal to the illusory nature of phenomena and knowledge is an argument for consensus and convention, while at the same time, negating the irrationality of imputing essences to dependently originated things. 

I would argue that the present interest in Yogacāra, for example, is as much a function of the penetration of postmodernism into Buddhist studies as it is a function of increased linguistic understanding of Buddhist texts and so on. It is not an accident that in America and England, the continental fascination with yogacāra has met with quite a bit of resistance. 

Now that we have scholars moving from being disinterested coroners of religion to invested proponents, this is changing, and it is not surprising that the strongest proponents of gzhan stong and yogacāra are Europeans. Frankly, a lot of argument between modern Mādhyamikas such as myself and those who adhere to various species of yogācara can be traced to a divide between how knowledge is handled by analytical and continental philosophy in general. 

On the other hand, I can't tell you how many dissertations I have read in Buddhist studies over the years complete with accounts of methodologies derived from Said, Tambiah, etc. and so on. It seems that modern professors in Buddhist studies departments are demanding 100 pages or so filled with bullshit about the student's methodology and approach rooted in some postmodern drivel. 

It is also not surprising that we have modern lamas who seem to have grasped onto Nietzschean moral nihilism with respect to the behavior of "mahāsiddhas," especially of the modern variety, whose main siddhis seem to be gathering students and bilking them of their money, just to bring this whole exchange

Burroughs was wrong. It led to the US Military exiling the press. When I was a child, every night between 1968-1975 there was unedited, raw news footage of the Vietnam war on ABC, CBS, and NBC. Now, we see at best sanitized footage with grim journalists standing in other countries reporting on the  latest war news. So, the effect of the anti-war movement was to cause the US military to end press access to war zones. This is one reason we stayed in Iraq and Afghanistan for so long. As for the latter, many people in the US had no idea we were still there when Biden finally pulled us out.

Nietzsche was a cipher, meaning that one could selectively read whatever one wanted into him. Unfortunately, Will to Power is the most read title of one of his least understood books, inspiring many mini-Hitler wannabes. The other thing is that N has always ironically been more inspiring to the right than the left, because they interpret his anti statism not as a critique of state power, but as critique of consensus and cooperation.

For public schools, there needs to be a national curriculum, for example, in history, literature, social, and civil studies, as well as in the sciences, biology, physics, etc. You do realize that there are school districts (not many, but they exist) in the US that require teaching that the holocaust is only an OPINION; that evolution is only an OPINION, and one must also teach creationism alongside it; that one has to provide a fair and balanced picture of SLAVERY, showing that slaves also benefitted from the system, and so on. You are aware of these things, correct? And of course, there is,  in most secondary school textbooks on US history, no account of the real story of America's westward expansion and oppression of native people, beginning in the 1830's with Jackson's Indian Removals, etc. These things are not an issue where I live but they are serious issue in South, etc.

My personal role model is ChNN. He was always unfailingly polite, kind, humble, and never lashed out or behaved in a "crazy" manner. He never gaslighted anyone. This is not to say that he was never sharp, never scolded anyone, or never used sarcasm. He would get angry if a situation warranted it.  But for the most part he was pretty relaxed, and at the same time, intensely focused on benefitting his students. 

He was very clear about what he was doing and one could either "be in his boat" or not. His list of 27 personal samayas he adopted before he began teaching Dzogchen is illustrative of his whole approach to being a teacher. He did not give a flying f**k about Tibetan hierarchy per se, while at the same time caring deeply about Tibetan culture and history. But he never tried to turn his students into little imitation Tibetans nor did he try to invent a dharma culture by creating a mashup of Asian and Western cultures, like Trungpa, etc. He understood westerners were westerners, and that what we needed was the essentials of Dharma, not all the cultural bullshit that has hitched a ride with Vajrayāna teachings. He always put Dzogchen Community first, even when it caused problems in his personal life. He always used to called himself Dzogchen Community member #1, as we all have membership numbers.

Its obvious. For example, in the South, they still refer to the Civil War as the war of Northern Aggression, and they still use textbooks on the Civil War written by "Lost Cause" historians. In Texas, you will find virtually no reference at all to the fact that Texas as the last state after the Civil War to receive the Emancipation Proclamation (Juneteenth), and so on, or that Texas was founded to promote slavery. 

There is no little to no civil studies taught in primary or secondary schools any more. There is little to no PE taught in Inner City schools because of lack of funding. Classrooms sizes range from 40 to 60 students at all levels in public schools systems. Teachers are not given living wages. Teachers Unions are demonized on the smallest pretexts. It goes way beyond curriculums. 

The US educational system has been rendered dysfunctional by a whole host of issues beyond teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic, and as far as the latter three are concerned, I would say that most students in the US in the public school system graduate with insufficient skills in grammar and composition. Every college in the US has writing and grammar class requirements for freshman, because the functional literacy rate in the US has been plummeting for the past five decades.  For example:

According to the U.S. Department of Education, 54% of U.S. adults 16-74 years old - about 130 million people - lack proficiency in literacy, reading below the equivalent of a sixth-grade level.

A large driving force behind the "white flight" to the suburbs in many urban areas was because of education. Black majority schools have outdated textbooks, no computers, you name it, they don't have it. School policy and curriculum should set at the national level, not the local or state level. Want to educated your kids apart from that, fine, send your kids to private school, but no funding from the state, period, no grants, etc., nothing.

What Astus is looking for is the term "satyavidhaṃdvaya" in a sūtra in the same way we find "catursatya" in order to confirm the Buddha taught two truths. What I am pointing out is that term needn't be there for the intention to be there. And the intention is clearly there.

I don't agree with this. The Buddha is very clear in a passage that appears in Śamathadeva's commentary [mngon, ju 47a (Toh. 4094)] that one is not to have attachment to the etymologies (nirukti) of the people (jānapada), one is not to hasten to mundane names. It is because they are false. 

Prior to this, [mngon, ju 40b (Toh. 4094)], the Buddha is quoted as "Bhikṣus, the supreme (mchog) falsity is the phenomena that are false and deceptive. Bhikṣus, the supreme truths are like this, this is how they are. Therefore, the bhikṣus who posses that possess, the supreme blessings of truth." Moreover, there is a whole section later, where he discusses that which is empty as being false, deceptive, etc.

So you really just have not looked well enough, because of a literal mindedness you have been infected with through reading too much text critical literature. To insist that the two truths are not in the agamas because the term "satyadvaya" does not explicitly occur is very myopic. But the two truths are there, you just have to know to see them. Maybe you should get your eyes checked again.

Śamathadeva's commentary refers to sentient beings as relative (saṃvṛti), since they appropriate aggregates. Don dam, pāramārtha is a reference to emptiness. 

Arguing that the Sarvastivadins did not have a concept of two truths derived from sūtras, is, frankly just dumb. Astus is applying strict text critical criteria to the question, but that is useless here, because the fact is that it is discussed by Vasubandhu, and earlier, etc. It is scholastic myopia only that would lead one to claim that there is not evidence of the two truths in the agamas. Nāgārjuna would not have bothered mentioning it had he thought there would be a serious contest about his claim:

The dharma taught the buddhas
properly relies on two truths.

No, we do not know this. It's a ridiculous assertion. If it were true, then one would be accusing Jigme Lingpa, Shabkar, Dodrupchen Tenpé Nyima, and so on, of having wrong views, because all these men trained in the Geluk system and promulgated Geluk Yikcha in their monasteries, which remain the curriculum current in most Nyingma monasteries in Golok and Amdo. Moreover, it amounts to a claim that Geluk Vajrayāna is invalid and is incapable of producing awakening. This is a ridiculous assertion and merely shows narrow mindedness and lack of education on the part of those who sponsor such views, no matter who they are are. This is illustrated by the shame expressed by Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok, for example, for having naively criticized the views of Tsongkhapa when he was young, whom he later to came to understand was a great mahasiddha, etc. Just study Tsonghapa's praise to dependent origination. You will be unable to find in it a single fault.

For you, Mipham seems to be the summum bonum of Madhyamaka, even though for me, he just another in a long line of Tibetans. The fact mainstream Madhyamakas accept outer objects conventionally is noncontroversial. It’s true that Shantaraksita, of whom Mipham is very fond, likes Yogacara for conventional truth. But as the passage from Sapan demonstrates, Madhyamakas tend to be content different presentations of conventional truth. Certainly, most Mainstream Madhyamakas accept the Sautrantika perpective. This again is noncontroversial. Also, Mipham defense of rang rig is uncertain. Candrakirti clearly understands rang rig as memory, not a self-illuminating mind, but that may simply be a fault in the translation,

So, it really all depends on whether what perspective you are addressing things from. The Gelug POV always takes into consideration common mundane convention as the baseline for discussion. But even they, when it comes to meditating the path in Vajrayāna, consider phenomena to be mind, and ultimately, free of proliferation. 

What Gorampa, and later Mipham, are criticizing the Gelug point of view for, is granting an undue existential status that is not required at all to explain the conventional truth of ordinary persons, that is, the point of view of people who have not analyzed anything. Relative truth does not bear ultimate analysis, but on the other hand, claiming we cannot known anything of the world beyond our five senses is also not an argument that any Mādhyamika would seriously propose, since even Mādhyamikas admit that a sense consciousness will not arise in absence of a sense object, and that the two truths are objects of true and false cognitions. For example, Aryadeva clearly states:

Dependent on eye and form, 
the mind arises like an illusion,
it is not reasonable to call
illusory that which has existence.

Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas, Sonam, Snow Lion, 1994, pg. 261. 

This verse itself is sufficient to show that Mādhyamikas accept outer objects conventionally.

This are the three main passages that Phakpa explains. First, in order to point out that he was teaching myriad bodhisattvas in the ocean:

As soon as Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said those words, many thousands of lotuses rose up into the sky from within the oceans. Many thousands of bodhisattvas were seated upon those lotuses. Then those bodhisattvas came through the sky to Vulture Peak and remained suspended in the sky above it. Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta had guided all of them toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Those bodhisattvas who had previously entered the Mahāyāna praised the six perfections and the qualities of the Mahāyāna, while the bodhisattvas who had previously been śrāvakas praised the Śrāvakayāna. All of them knew the qualities of the Mahāyāna and the emptiness of all phenomena.

Then, the qualities of Sāgara's daughter, as we already discussed, are qualities of a tenth stage bodhisattva described at length in various sūtras, of those, these are included. 

The daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, said, “Venerable Śāriputra, if I have great miraculous power, I will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood even more quickly than that jewel was accepted.”

And:

That bodhisattva now went to the south and, in a southern world realm named Vimalā, manifested the attainment of perfect buddhahood while seated at the foot of a tree made of the seven precious materials.

Note, the future tense, "I will" and then the actual statement "manifested".

As mentioned above, a tenth stage bodhisattva has the power to demonstrate any form to any being to be tamed. 

This raises the question, when does buddhahood begin? We have an answer, actually. According to Maitreyanātha, buddhahood begins on the tenth bhumi, as he says, because the gnosis beyond the ninth bhumi is the gnosis of a buddha. So, the "sudden awakening" of the daughter of Sāgara is just another one of your favorite things, it's an upaya, but that does not mean it ought to be taken literally.

No, definitely not. In fact, the Chogyal Phakpa, fifth founder master of Sakya, has a text specifically aimed at addressing misconceptions about the Nāgā princess tale. He was the imperial preceptor to Kublai Khan, was fluent in Chinese, and interacted daily with the Chinese Buddhists. 

He addresses your contention that she was able to traverse the entire path in eight years, soup to nuts. According to him, the Lotus itself shows that the retinue of nāgās were not ordinary trainees who had never entered the path and that there was no training in method. Why? Those nāgās had previously entered Mahāyāna as evidenced by the fact that they praised the qualities of Mahāyāna and the six perfections. Chogyal Phagpa contends that the nāga girl was an tenth stage bodhisattva in fact, from birth, based on the passage, "She has great wisdom, sharp faculties. The actions of her body, speech, and mind are preceded by wisdom..." He claims all these are qualities of a tenth stage bodhisattva, and cites the Sutrālaṃkāra in support of this. Specifically he cites power over the doors of dhāraṇi as being a quality only of tenth stage bodhisattvas. He then defines how long it takes to attain that stage. It takes one uncountable eon to reach the first stage. A second to reach the eighth stage. At that time, one attains patience to the nonarising of dharmas and receives a prediction of buddhahood by the buddhas. It takes a third incalculable eon to attain unsurpassed buddhahood. 

He points out that the full awakening of a tenth bodhisattva is not an instant awakening without traversing the paths and stages, but is in fact the conclusion of the ordinary progress of a bodhisattva. Further, he also points that she, as a tenth stage bodhisattva, was an emanation, that as an ordinary women with karmic obscurations, she could not attain the tenth bhumi. As one who was irreversible and had realized the gnosis of the tenth stage, the nāgā princess was an emanation of a tenth stage bodhisattva, which was revealed by her transformation into a male, her actual form. He further asserts her buddhahood in the southern world system was an emanational act of a tenth stage bodhisattva, rather than the attainment of buddhahood. Again, based on the sūtra's actual words, he claims the texts reads that she exhibited buddhahood to all, not that she was a buddha, pointing out that exhibiting full buddhahood and emanating a buddha kāya, including all the deeds of a buddha, such as residing Tuṣita, conception up through parinirvana, are among the listed powers of a tenth stage bodhisattva such as Avalokiteśvara, etc., as explained in the Sutra of the Ten stages. 

Chogyal Phakpa, when setting out the intention of this sūtra, agrees it is a definitive sūtra, but for entirely different reasons. He says the intent of this sūtra is, ""Since all phenomena are of one taste and all vehicles are accomplished in a single vehicle, the Sūtra of the White Lotus of the Sublime Dharma was produced to show that the result is of one taste in the ocean of gnosis of Tathāgata," and so on. 

So, a very different perspective.

Empty things, reflections and the like,
dependent on conditions, are not imperceptible.
And just as empty forms reflected in a glass
create a consciousness in aspect similar,
so all things, though empty, 
strongly manifest within their very emptiness,
and since inherent nature is in neither truth,
phenomena are neither nothing nor unchanging entities.

A nonexistent object cannot appear at all, for example, the child of a barren women or the horns of a hare. An existent object can certainly appear, such as liquid to the sentient beings of the six realms, without having to posit that existence as anything more than a convention. Certainly, one cannot establish such an object ultimately, but on the other hand, one cannot speak of the emptiness of a nonexistent, such as the child of a barren women either. Thus appearances are neither true, nor are they false, just like the moon in the water. Without the moon reflected in the water, an appearance of the moon in the water cannot exist, and thus a mind in which the moon in the water appears cannot exist. The mind in which the moon appears to be reflected in the water cannot exist before the moon is reflected in the water, nor after. The mind in which the moon appears to be reflected in the water can exist only while it is apprehending the moon reflected in the water. When the moon is no longer reflected in the water, the mind in which the moon reflected in the water appears ceases. 

Nothing exists from its own side. Objects are not primary, nor are minds. They are mutually dependent, therefore, neither are established in truth, and all is conventional. This is the meaning of arising from conditions.

In any case, Tsongkhapa had already rejected a key point in the Sakya system of Cakrasamvara over all, the idea that the "ultimate secret" (guhyānta) means what the Sakyapas claim it means. You can read about that in Gray's intro to his translation of  the Laghusamvara.

Considering that Pabhongkha is considered to the main person who transmitted the Ganden Mahāmudrā tradition in the last century to the present generation, and since he explicitly writes that Tsongkhapa rejected introductions, using this as a precedent for excluding the introduction to dharmatā that is part of the Sakyapa Naro Khachö system, I'd say we can definitely accept his opinion. 

On the face of it, the Ganden Mahāmudra is little different than the other Mahāmudra systems in Tibet that trace their origin to Saraha. The Panchen Lama calls it "sutra mahāmudra" ostensibly because he is not requiring an empowerment, but the instructions themselves are virtually identical to such texts as "In Front of the Stupa" in Sakya, differing only in that some empowerment is required to practice the former. Also, recall, Ganden Mahāmudra provoked considerable controversy in the beginning, since up to that point the Gelukpas pretty consistently followed Sapan's rejection of so-called sūtra mahāmudra, and it even annoyed the Great Fifth, who was involved in an actual war with the Karma Kagyu school. 

There is also the fact that you and I may mean different things by "introduction."

Yes, actually it did, in the work of Ratnakāraśanti, a paṇḍita of Vikramaśila. Apart from tathāgatagarbha, which he ignored, his arguments about the ultimate existence of gnosis are taken directly  from his works by such gzhan stong scholars as Shakya Chogden, Taranatha, etc. There is also his attempt to reconcile Nāgārjuna with the Maitreyan corpus, which also inspired these gzhan stong scholars. One of his works was translated by his student, the Nepali paṇdita, Śantibhadra, complete with a colophon complaining bitterly of the annihilationism of Candrakīrti. Someone recently did a paper on this text which you can find on Academia edu.

Incidentally, you contradict your own tradition, which asserts that gzhan stong entered Tibetan through the Kashmiri Paṇḍita Sajjana, so again, an Indian paṇḍita...

I disagree, it has a huge impact on how your practice today is shaped. The debates and controversies at Nalanda and Vikramashila had a huge impact on what was transmitted to Tibet, by whom, and when. Those impacts continue to resound today even here on Dharmawheel. But this little diversion is  

What I am referring to is that fact that subitist* tendencies are quite pronounced in Chinese Buddhism, because of the embrace of TG; whereas they are quite suppressed and reigned in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, where the TG has, with difficulty, been absorbed. The reason for this clearly is the absence of Indian influence on the one hand, and its presence on the other. Even the schools that embrace wholeheartedly the TG doctrine in Tibet are still gradualist in orientation. And most Tibetan Buddhist scholars (but not all), historically, have not paid much attention to the TG doctrine, other than polemically, and as at best a provisional teaching. And this again has everything to do with what some Indian dudes thought.

*Subitism: The application of the term "subitism" to Buddhism is derived from the French illumination subite (sudden awakening), contrasting with 'illumination graduelle' (gradual awakening). It gained currency in this use in English from the work of sinologist Paul Demiéville. His 1947 work 'Mirror of the Mind' was widely read in the U.S. It inaugurated a series by him on subitism and gradualism.[web 1][5]

More than that— his experience of awakening, according to Gelug lore, came from his sustained interactions with Mañjuśrī, first through Lama Umapa and next, through his own visionary experience.

It would be interesting to see a comparison made between the six yogas of Naropa texts he wrote with the Jigten Sumgon texts. Thubten Jinpa's bio of Tsongkhapa (well written and interesting) states that in the colophons of his Vajrayāna texts made it clear that he had realized the meaning of these teachings, before he felt comfortable setting them down in the last ten years or so of his life.

Content:
November 24, 2021
Heather Cox Richardson Nov 25

The Biden administration has announced it will convene the first of two virtual “Summits for Democracy” on December 9 and 10, 2021. The gatherings will bring together leaders from 110 countries who work in government, civil society, and the private sector, to come up with an agenda to renew democratic government and work together to keep the ideals of democracy strong.

Authoritarianism is growing around the world, including in America, and the administration is hoping to create practical ideas and strong alliances to defend against authoritarianism, fight corruption, and promote human rights, all values central to democracy.

That this announcement comes at Thanksgiving is fitting, since Thanksgiving is rooted in a defense of democracy during the Civil War.

The Pilgrims and the Wampanoags did indeed share a harvest celebration together at Plymouth in fall 1621, but that moment got forgotten almost immediately, overwritten by the long history of the settlers’ attacks on their Indigenous neighbors.

In 1841, a book that reprinted the early diaries and letters from the Plymouth colony recovered the story of that three-day celebration in which ninety Indigenous Americans and the English settlers shared fowl and deer. This story of peace and goodwill among men who by the 1840s were more often enemies than not inspired Sarah Josepha Hale, who edited the popular women’s magazine Godey’s Lady's Book, to think that a national celebration could ease similar tensions building between the slave-holding South and the free North. She lobbied for legislation to establish a day of national thanksgiving.

And then, on April 12, 1861, southern soldiers fired on Fort Sumter, a federal fort in Charleston Harbor, and the meaning of a holiday for giving thanks changed.

Southern leaders wanted to destroy the United States of America and create their own country, based not in the traditional American idea that “all men are created equal,” but rather in its opposite: that some men were better than others and had the right to enslave their neighbors. In the 1850s, convinced that society worked best if a few wealthy men ran it, southern leaders had bent the laws of the United States to their benefit, using it to protect enslavement above all.

In 1860, northerners elected Abraham Lincoln to the presidency to stop rich southern enslavers from taking over the government and using it to cement their own wealth and power. As soon as he was elected, southern leaders pulled their states out of the Union to set up their own country. After the firing on Fort Sumter, Lincoln and the fledgling Republican Party set out to end the slaveholders’ rebellion.

The early years of the war did not go well for the U.S. By the end of 1862, the armies still held, but people on the home front were losing faith. Leaders recognized the need both to acknowledge the suffering and to keep Americans loyal to the cause. In November and December, seventeen state governors declared state thanksgiving holidays.

New York Governor Edwin Morgan’s widely reprinted proclamation about the holiday reflected that the previous year “is numbered among the dark periods of history, and its sorrowful records are graven on many hearthstones.” But this was nonetheless a time for giving thanks, he wrote, because “the precious blood shed in the cause of our country will hallow and strengthen our love and our reverence for it and its institutions…. Our Government and institutions placed in jeopardy have brought us to a more just appreciation of their value.”

The next year Lincoln got ahead of the state proclamations. On July 15, he declared a national day of Thanksgiving, and the relief in his proclamation was almost palpable. After two years of disasters, the Union army was finally winning. Bloody, yes; battered, yes; but winning. At Gettysburg in early July, Union troops had sent Confederates reeling back southward. Then, on July 4, Vicksburg had finally fallen to U. S. Grant’s army. The military tide was turning.

President Lincoln set Thursday, August 6, 1863, for the national day of Thanksgiving. On that day, ministers across the country listed the signal victories of the U.S. Army and Navy in the past year and reassured their congregations that it was only a matter of time until the United States government put down the southern rebellion. Their predictions acknowledged the dead and reinforced the idea that their sacrifice had not been in vain.

In October 1863, President Lincoln declared a second national day of Thanksgiving. In the past year, he declared, the nation had been blessed.

In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, he wrote, Americans had maintained their laws and their institutions and had kept foreign countries from meddling with their nation. They had paid for the war as they went, refusing to permit the destruction to cripple the economy. Instead, as they funded the war, they had also advanced farming, industry, mining, and shipping. Immigrants had poured into the country to replace men lost on the battlefield, and the economy was booming. And Lincoln had recently promised that the government would end slavery once and for all. The country, he predicted, “with a large increase of freedom,” would survive, stronger and more prosperous than ever. The president invited Americans “in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those who are sojourning in foreign lands” to observe the last Thursday of November as a day of Thanksgiving.

In 1863, November’s last Thursday fell on the 26th. On November 19, Lincoln delivered an address at the dedication of a national cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He reached back to the Declaration of Independence for the principles on which he called for Americans to rebuild the severed nation:

​​”Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”

Lincoln urged the crowd to take up the torch those who fought at Gettysburg had laid down. He called for them to “highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

The following year, Lincoln proclaimed another day of Thanksgiving, this time congratulating Americans that God had favored them not only with immigration but also with the emancipation of formerly enslaved people. “Moreover,” Lincoln wrote, “He has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions.”

In 1861, Americans went to war to keep a cabal from taking control of the government and turning it into an oligarchy. The fight against that rebellion seemed at first to be too much for the nation to survive. But Americans rallied and threw their hearts into the cause on the battlefields even as they continued to work on the home front for a government that defended democracy and equality before the law.

And they won.

My best to you all for Thanksgiving 2021.

Vajradhara, as depicted in Sakya and Geluk, demonstrates the so-called seven limbs of the three kāyas, which is the result of the fourth empowerment and represents realization of mahāmudrā. The source of this presentation is the Jñānavajrasammucaya Tantra.

The simplest way to explains this is that the limb of the dharmakāya is naturelessness, or lack of inherent existence (rang bzhin med pa); the three limbs of the sambhogakāya are complete enjoyment, union, and great bliss; and the three limbs of the nirmanakāya are being filled with compassion, not being interrupted, and never ceasing. Sometimes the limbs of not being interrupted or ceasing is placed with the dharmakāya.  

There is no "transition" from Samantabhadra to Vajradhara. Samantabhadra is the name given to the dharmakāya in the root tantra of yoga tantra, the Compendium of the Principles of the Tathāgatas as well as the Guhyasamāja Tantra, the root tantra of the so-called father tantras in highest yoga tantra.

One has to know how to properly conduct the rite. If one bestows refuge vows and bodhisattva vows there is no particular responsibility, but I think it can become kind of an ego trip. Even some Tibetan Lamas will incorrectly claim that having bestowed refuge, now the student has samaya with that teacher and so on. I just think it is better to encourage people to receive refuge and bodhisattva vows from qualified lamas, preferably lineage heads, and among those, bhikṣus like HH Dalai Lama are preferable to upasākas. One should recall that among vajramasters, a bhiḳsu with intact vows is supreme, according to Kalacakra. On the other hand, though this is ideal, life is short, and if one does not want to use the rite of administering refuge and bodhisattva vows to oneself, then any qualified teacher who is willing to give them will do.

Technically, Sapan and Gampopa's texts are "stages of the doctrine" (bstan rim) rather than "stages of the path" (lam rim). 

The former are based on Maitreya's Ornament of Mahāyāna Sutras, which begin with the discussion of gotra, or inclination for awakening and conclude with a discussion of the three kāyas. The latter are based on Atisha's Lamp of the Path of Awakening, begins with a discussion of the qualities of the teacher and conclude with a discussion of śamatha and vipaśyāna and the desirability of practicing Vajrayāna.  This is how one discerns the distinction between these two genres of texts.

Well, the problem with this idea is that guru can’t do anything for you in the bardo, other than recite some prayers and maybe recite the bardo thodrol for you, which you may or may not be aware of in the blooming buzzing confusion of the bardo. If the guru could not pick you up by the neck and liberate you in this life, what makes you think they can do so in bardo? If you’ve received Vajrayana teachings, and you experience the bardo, it’s your fault for not practicing hard enough.

This is just an opinion. This is not stated anywhere in sutra.

In the shravakayana, refuge vows must be received from a fully ordained bhikshu, but they only last until death.

Mahayana refuge vows are also lost at death, but since they are connected with bodhicitta, bodhisattva vows last until one attains buddhahood, unless one gives up,the motivation for buddhahood.

Anyone who has has Mahayana refuge vows, and understands the procedure for bestowing refuge vows, can bestow refuge vows. There is no special qualification needed other than that one’s own refuge is intact.

Maybe. The definition of Buddha's omniscience does not come from sūtra, it comes from śastra. And it has limits. Strictly speaking it is knowledge of all phenomena. But "all phenomena" simply refers to one aggregate, one sense base, and one sense element. It does not refer to everything in the universe, known and unknown. It refers to that which is one's personal range. Thus, to bring up another contentious point, the Buddha can be "incorrect" (that is to say, bow to conventions of his day) about Meru, but still be entirely correct about the paths and stages. We do not need to ascribe super powers to the Buddha even he didn't claim.

The second point is that killing animals does not violate one's vows of refuge. If it did, it would be a parajika for monks, but it isn't. It is merely an offense requiring confession, without a punishment, like drinking alcohol and damaging plants, and about 88 other acts. The vow not to kill, means not to kill human beings.  The deliberate killing of animals does go against the commitment of training in the Dharma, non-harming, but that is not one of the five vows, it is a commitment than even butchers who go for refuge aspire to. And arguably, farming goes against that commitment as well, hence the reason monastics are forbidden from agricultural work in its entirety. For this reason, Buddhajñānapāda was astonished when he met Mañjuśrīmitra, who was a bhikṣu, the latter was plowing a field, and later came home staggeringly drunk in the evening. Mañjuśrīmitra's wife gutted a fish for their meal, and so on. In other words they lived like many Tibetan lamas do, in robes, behaving like laypeople. Go figure.

Everything you are talking about is conventional, all experiences are labeled right out the box. That’s why we don’t pay attention to them very much, other than path experiences, which fit a very narrow, phenomenological profile.

But the real point here is “What is going to produce realization of the path of seeing.” For example, the Uttaratantra is entirely descriptive, not prescriptive at all, unlike the other Maitreya texts like Distinguishing the Middle from Extremes, and the Ornament of Mahayana Sutras. The latter is the basis of the presentation of how to practice the Mahayana path for all schools. Most yogacara literature that has come down to us is commentary on this text. Even beyond this, we can understand all this business about tathagatagarbha is purely speculative because only Buddhas can perceive it. We cannot. It is cognitively closed to us, according to tathagatagarbha sutras themselves. So while I appreciate your appeal to meditative experience, you will never experience or perceive tathagatagarbha until you are a Buddha and have realized the dharmakaya. And the consequence of this is that this topic is, from beginning to end, including Karls remarks, total intellectual proliferation with no relevance to anyone’s practice, your’s, mine, or anyone else.

The Madhyamaka school has always focused more on view, whereas the Yogacara school focuses more on the path — this is obvious from looking at their respective texts. This is not news.

We can, but Candrakīrti's presentation is the best, when all is said and done. 

I don't study these things for their aesthetics, though there is much that is aesthetically pleasing in Yogacāra theory. I study these things for my practice. And the traditions in which I practice, Sakya and Dzogchen, for many reasons, find Madhyamaka to be the definitive Mahāyāna view. Also the Indian Buddhist tantras show a clear bias towards Madhyamaka. 

Anyway, you quote Shakya Chogden, you should always remember that Shakya Chogden's view was kicked out of Sakya by the protector Caturmukha Mahākāla in favor of Gorampa's.  And in truth it is not even clear that gshan stong was really his final view. It's been speculated that since his main sponsors were Kagyus, he was writing for his audience. 

Actually, the problem with Tibetans, and I have said this before, is that because Ratnakāraśānti asserted in his Madhyamaka texts that Asanga was a third stage bodhisattva and Nāgārjuna was a first stage bodhisattva, and also the main translator of them, Śantibhadra, was hostile to Candrakīrti's school, there has been a push amongst Tibetans to reconcile the treatises of Maitreya and Nāgarjuna. 

Personally, I see no need to reconcile Madhyamaka with Yogacāra, since the former is higher than the latter; and even Karl admits that the gzhan stong approach to the three natures, for example, is not precedented in the Indian traditions from which the gzhan stong school draws its inspiration.

There are two ways to understand this: one is that ālayavijñāna vanishes when the seeds it contains are exhausted (Vasubandu in Karmasiddhiprakarana). The other is that it undergoes a transformation into gnosis, along with the other skandhas. They are not discarded, they are subject to a "a transformation in the basis" or as Karl has it, "a fundamental change" (āśrayaparivṛitti). His section on ālayavijñāna in the introduction to his translation of the Mahāyāna Samgraha is worth reading. Also the relationship between dharmakāya and ālayavijñāna is discussed in chapter 10 of the MS, pg. 238. The main problem with Yogacāra that everyone points out, is that there is a internal contradiction when one claims something compounded (the ālayavijñāna) transforms into something uncompounded (the dharmakāya). 

In short, the one cannot really appreciate the nuances of Yogacara, tathāgatagarbha theory from soundbites of videos of scholars on the internet. Its not even responsible to present these teachings in that way.

So there are two minds now? One impure, the other pure? So nine consciousnesses, rather than eight? Sapan already dispensed with this absurdity. The gnyug ma sems is just the clarity aspect of the all-basis consciousness, that's the point.

This is one of the problems with tathāgatagarbha theory. You have one sūtra proclaiming it is dharmakāya encased in afflictions; another claiming it is just a name for ālayavijñāna. The Yogacārins, as Karl correctly points out, won't have anything to do with it. And then you have Tibetans with too much time on their hands trying to reconcile all these conflicting doctrines, which do not actually have to be reconciled at all.

Just stick with Prasanga. You'll be happier.

This passage is not correctly translated because Higgens mistakes a genitive for an locative:

’o na gnyug ma’i sems ni gang zhe na de ni da ltar rang rgyud kyi tha mal gyi shes

"If it is asked what is the innate mind, that is the ordinary consciousness of one's continuum at this moment."

The distinction between the locative case and the genitive case here is crucial. All this means is that the so-called "innate mind" is the clarity aspect of the all-basis. Also he mistakes for a locative, the dative "da ltar," it is an easy mistake to make in Tibetan since they have the same morphology, and the difference is context driven.

Otherwise, the problem arises of supposing there are two minds.

At that point, all that remains is omniscience, like every other presentation of buddhahood. There are some variations in how that works.

But as I said, this is not a problem at all. Buddhanature is a provisional doctrine, according to the Uttaratantra itself, taught to eliminate five faults. It is training wheels for baby bodhisattvas who are scared of emptiness.

I doubt very much that Karl is an annihilationist. You have really misunderstood his point, quite grievously. What he and the karmapas are implying is that there never were sentient beings to begin with. This is not controversial. Haribhadra, a Madhyamaka, points out than when one realizes buddhahood, one realizes too there was never a time when one was not a buddha. This insight does not depend on the Buddhanature doctrine at all, since it is straight out of the PP Sutras. Moreover, it is commonly stated that from the point of the view of the result, Buddhas only perceive other Buddhas, they do not perceive sentient beings, because to perceive obscurations would equal being obscured. Buddhas have no obscurations, hence they do not perceive them, ergo, they have no perception of sentient beings at all. Thus is another reason why Haribhadra points out that the path is entirely illusory from beginning to end, including the attainment of buddhahood.

Food of Bodhisattvas: Buddhist Teachings on Abstaining from Meat. 

Zhabkar's approach is pragmatic, not dogmatic. He understands that in the Tibetan context, people just are not generally going to live on vegetables, grain, and dairy alone. It is a myth, BTW, that Tibetans could not grow vegetables in Tibet. They grew plenty of things: peas, barely, wheat, etc. They merely selected for things that were could be stored long term, and that excluded fresh vegetables, which require a lot of agricultural resources for a limited return in a cold,  dry alpine climate. And of course, Tibetan diets varied regionally.

In the case of Tibetan Buddhist communities, this was virtually always done at the encouragement of a lama, with the thinking, "If you build it, they will come." 

The reality is quite different. Most of the centers built in the 80's and 90's for example, are aging out, and are not drawing new students. When I see people like Alan Wallace buying multimillion dollar facilities in the middle of nowhere in Colorado,Italy, and New Zealand, I really have to wonder just what he and people like him are thinking. 

One of the things I admire about Eric Columbel, the director of Tsadra, is that he has no interest in bricks and mortar. He is only interested in books. He understands that the future of Dharma lies in translations, not expensive properties.

It means they should rely on meat and mild alcohol during meals to keep up their strength and stamina. In general, in Mahāyāna one should avoid meat. But in Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra, the consumption of meat is permitted. Despite this, there is a strong inclination to avoid meat other than in feasts. And as the link between industrial agriculture and climate change has become clear, many Buddhists are steering away from meat because of their conscience. 

If one is a serious practitioner of Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra, you can eat meat. But one is not, then it is better to avoid it, apart from feasts.

Sometimes he did, sometimes he did not. That answer to that is that it is usually practice dependent.

Yes, when we investigated our minds, even though we cannot find anything, we cannot deny there is looking. This is generally termed gsal rig, clear and knowing, and is the characteristic of the mind. The essence of the mind is emptiness. 

The nature of the mind has three aspects, it is clear, knowing, and empty. Clarity and knowing are somethings collapsed for convenience into clarity, to make it easier to map the resultant three kāyas to the causal nature of the mind. 

In both Dzogchen and Mahāmudra meditation, one first identifies the clarity aspect by looking for the mind, when it is not found, this is called "sealing clarity with emptiness." When one concludes that despite not being able to find anything, one cannot deny there is an act of looking for the mind, this is called sealing "emptiness with clarity." When one is able to rest in the clear and empty nature of the mind without tending to one side or the other, this is called "sealing inseparability with inseparability." 

If there is anything absolute about the nature of the mind, it is the inseparability of clarity and emptiness, which itself is uncompounded, naturally perfected, nonarising, beginningless, and unceasing.

I already answered that question:

https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.p ... 90#p607790

Rig pa does not equal awareness. The latter translation equivalent, virtually all modern translators agree, is completely inadequate to explain the term rig pa. Translators such as Erik PK, Adriano Clemente, etc., understanding this term is inadequate, have defaulted to not translating it. Other translators like Sangye Khandro opt to gloss it with the term "pristine awareness," other's "pure awareness," still other "primordial mind" and so on on. 

The fact that some teachers continue to use "awareness" for "rigpa" in their teaching is unfortunate. It causes their students no end of confusion.

Rig pa is something very specific that is not captured by the word "awareness" or any gloss. Now, if someone is practicing Dzogchen, and understands what rig pa is, when they see the term awareness in a gloss, they will not be confused. But if someone is following a Dzogchen teaching, and they have not actually come to understand what rig pa is, for them the term is impenetrable, just as it is for you.

There is a Dzogchen tantra that points out that what we are discussing is really inexpressible, but it is appropriate to try and explain this in words. Therefore, how it is explained in words becomes extremely important.

Awareness is just a mental factor that accompanies consciousness. There is no specific word in Sanskrit for what we term awareness. It is derived from this PIE root:

*wer- (3)
Proto-Indo-European root meaning "perceive, watch out for."

It forms all or part of: Arcturus; avant-garde; award; aware; beware; Edward; ephor; garderobe; guard; hardware; irreverence; lord; panorama; pylorus; rearward; regard; revere; reverence; reverend; reward; software; steward; vanguard; ward; warden; warder; wardrobe; ware (n.) "manufactured goods, goods for sale;" ware (v.) "to take heed of, beware;" warehouse; wary.

It is the hypothetical source of/evidence for its existence is provided by: Latin vereri "to observe with awe, revere, respect, fear;" Greek ouros "a guard, watchman," horan "to see;" Hittite werite- "to see;" Old English weard "a guarding, protection; watchman, sentry, keeper."

The idea that there can be awakening without analytical insight, aka, vipaśyanā, has been rejected in Tibetan Buddhism since the eighth century. 

Evidence shows that samadhi is not necessary for awakening at all, actually, as we see from the large number of people who attained stream entry and even arhatship through what is called dry vipaśyanā. Certainly samadhi, aka śamatha, aka calm-abiding can help stabilize the mind, thus making insight more stable, but the crucial factor in awakening, achieving the path of seeing, is insight, not samadhi.

Just as a bird needs two wings to fly, generally speaking a practitioner needs both wisdom (prajñā) and method (upaya); vipaśyāna and śamatha in union.

Awareness is a function of being conscious. If you are not conscious, you are not aware. 

The dharma has very precise language with which we discuss the mind and its functions. It's called abhidharma. If people do not ground their discussions of dharma in vinaya, sūtra, or abhidharma, they are just making shit up. 

If anything, what people are here calling "awareness" is either samjñā, perception, the third skandha; or manaskāra, attention, which is a mental factor. Well, they are both mental factors, but the reason "perception" gets it own skandha is that it is one of two mental factors that pull us most strongly towards afflictive objects. The other being vedana, sensation.,

Rig pa, often translated as awareness, derives from Sanskrit, vid: knowing , understanding , a knower. 

Rnam shes is generally a translation of vijñāna, the aggregate of consciousness, or one of the six senses consciousnesses. 

Shes pa is generally a translation of jñā, to know , have knowledge , become acquainted with (acc. ; rarely gen. MBh. iii , 2154 Hariv. 7095) , perceive , apprehend , understand (also with inf. [Pa1n2. 3-4 , 65] MBh. ii , v Das3.) , experience , recognise , ascertain , investigate RV. &amp;c. ; to know as , know or perceive that. This generally, in Tibetan texts, refers the five sense consciousnesses. 

The usage of the term rig pa in Kagyu and Sakya texts is more straightforward, where it refers the knowing aspect of the all-basis. 

In Dzogchen texts it is a much more complicated term. However, it has in general two interrelated meanings: the first is knowledge of the basis, that is, recognition of nature of the mind. Secondly, it refers to abiding in the nature of consciousness itself. Teacher like MIgyur Dorje and so on, and most modern translators working in Dzogchen material, tend to have taken up Herbert Guenther's early translation of rig pa as "awareness." Chogyal Namkhai Norbu coined the term "instant presence."

If, following Sakya Paṇḍita, one understands tathāgatagarbha to be freedom from proliferation, then there is no problem, since freedom from proliferation renders samara and nirvana possible for sentient beings. But if one takes tathāgatagarbha aka buddhadhātu to be something existent, it is no different than a nonbuddhist view of self. He makes a number of arguments to which the only response is some misguided, literal reading of tathāgatagarbha sūtras, one rejected in the Laṅkāvatara Sūtra, and even in the Uttaratantra itself, one imagines, because in 3rd century CE India, some people were taking this doctrine too literally. He even points out that if one argues that sugatagarbha denotes an uncontaminated mind, this refers only to the clear aspect of the ālayavijñāna, and not another ninth consciousness (Paramartha does make this argument, of course, but not in India, only in China). 

See A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes, pp. 56-58. 

One think that should stand out as remarkable to folks, something I have mentioned before, is just how little positive commentarial attention the tathāgatagarbha doctrine received in India prior to the eighth century and the appearance of the tantras. Indeed, we have no commentaries on the Uttaratantra composed by Indians after Asanga until the 11th century, and those were not translated into Tibetan at all. Talk about lack of interest. 

It is certainly true that there were Buddhist sectarians (Pudgalavādins) who proposed the existence of an inexpressible pudgala, neither the same as nor different from the aggregates. And this remains the problem for proponents of an existent buddhadhātu. Is it part of the aggregates or separate from them?

Yes, emptiness is unconditioned since it does not arise. But it still isn't anything at all. 

You see, there are only four unconditioned things in Buddhism: space and the two kinds of cessation: analytical cessation (nirvana), non-analytical cessation (simple absence of causation), and emptiness. But emptiness and nirvana are synonyms.

The perfection of wisdom states three things, which are all synonymous: all things are empty. All things are nonarisen. All things have always been in a state of nirvana. This means that nature of all things is that they are unconditioned. Everything that seems conditioned, is in reality, unconditioned. But that unconditioned state is still a negation. That's why it isn't anything at all. The unconditioned is not even unconditioned because there isn't anything to be unconditioned, since by definition, the unconditioned never arises. That which does not arise does not exist, for example, the sprout of burnt seed.

In this case, it does. emptiness isn't anything at all. It does not exist, since it does not arise. It does not not-exist, since it does not perish, it does not both exist and not exist, or neither, because of the fault arising from the previous two alternatives. One cannot speak coherently about that which does not arise. 

On the other hand, emptiness does not negate things, since it is the nature of things. The nature or essence of things is that they are natureless and essenceless. If there are no things, there is no emptiness of things to speak of. 

Emptiness and nonexistence are similar terms, for example, a bucket that is empty and a bucket that does not exist. In the first case we say a bucket is empty because there is nothing in the bucket, such as water and so on. To say a bucket is empty is to say nothing exists in the bucket. In the second case, when we say that bucket does not exist, it makes no sense to speak of an empty bucket at all. There is no bucket to be empty. 

When we say that things are empty, we are saying that things have no nature. There is nothing in things. Nothing fills them up. There is nothing to describe in things. That's why its fine to say that the nature of things is inexpressible. If there were something in things we could describe, being, existence, and so on, then we could describe that. But even nonexistence does not exist in things. Things are just empty. They are not filled with existence. they are not filled with nonexistence, and so on. They have not nature at all. They are hollow, mere appearances, nonarising by nature, like dreams, illusions, mirages, and other examples of empty things.  And when we examine things carefully, we find there are no things to be empty. 

Still, empty buckets make the most noise, as the saying goes.

Not all relative truths are conventional truths. This is a well established principle in Madhyamaka. So, there is a hierarchy of relative truths, i.e. true and false relative truth; and true relative truth is also called conventional truth, which is validated through a correspondence between naming and function. A thing is conventionally true only if it is efficient in producing a named result (arthakriya). The purpose of this distinction is to account for conventional transactions in the world, and also to account for the ability of words and meanings to contribute to realization of emptiness and so on. Even in Dzogchen tantras, the efficiency of language is accepted. It is a universally accepted Mahāyāna Buddhist dogma, derived from Nāgārjuna, that one needs to rely on conventional truth in order to understand ultimate truth, and without such understanding, realization is impossible.

So ask yourself, when are obscurations removed on the path? They are not even removed on the path of seeing. They only begin to be removed on the path of cultivation. So why should anyone place any trust in the random experiences and visions of anyone who is below the path of seeing, let alone the experiences reported by people who do not even have a precious human birth?

One expects someone on the path of seeing to be able to explain the five aggregates; actually, they should be able to explain this on the path of accumulation.

Yes, there are no “spiritual” experiences, since all these nonBuddhist people are deluded, by definition. So yes, given that they are subject to conceptual delusion, and have yet to met the authentic path, they have no way out. They either fabricate their “experiences” or they follow the herd. This is also true of some Buddhists, who in order to gain importance etc., claim to have visions of this bodhisattva and that, etc., even though they cannot properly explain even the five aggregates.

Even if someone has an experience of a visitation of some entity, like the Virgin of Guadalupe, one might charitably decide this was a visitation of Tara filtered through a cultural lens, but still this is not certain, and would just be a personal fabrication, absent any proof.

This is exactly how controversies about protectors in Tibet arise.

We know this for three reasons:

The teaching of dependent origination and emptiness does not exists outside of the Dharma. The Buddha has taught repeatedly that outside his Dharma and Vinaya there are no aryas, and even when there are pratyekabuddhas, they do not teach the dharma they realize on their own. So, if there were a such a person on Mt. Athos, for example, it would not matter to the world because they don’t teach the Dharma.

There are two ways: inference and direct knowledge of their minds.

Since we know there is no godhead, no higher being, etc., people who report such experiences, we can infer, are merely being overwhelmed by some cognitive state they are labeling a “mystical experience,” “grace,” etc., based on their social conditioning. 

Honestly, from the point of view of the Buddhist path, we don’t care very much about the conceptual mishmash that other religions refer to as “spiritual experience.” It is not at all conducive to what we in the Buddhist fold understand liberation to be. We don’t even care very much about what Buddhists call “experience.” Why? Experience is conceptual and transient. Even the experience of nonconceptuality is a very subtle conceptual experience. 

As for whether one can drawn equivalencies between the experience of emptiness, that is, nonconceptuality, in Buddhists and nonBuddhists, no one has claimed that nonconceptual experience is confined to Buddhists. But the experience of nonconceptuality is not the realization of emptiness, nor does it necessarily lead to the view of emptiness required for realizing emptiness. And indeed, the experience of emptiness aka nonconceptual can be a serious deviation even for Buddhists. 

As Buddhists we are constantly told our experiences are not important, and that we should not get trapped in experiences, because experiences may be indicators of approaching realization, but attachment to them hinders realization. Since these experiences have been carefully mapped out along the stages of the path, it’s pretty easy, once one knows these stages and their indicators, to sort out where one is on the path, as well as where others are, if they happen to be on a path. We never bother to categorize the experience of worldly people because their experience is completely samsaric, whether they are so-called religious people, spiritual people, or not. 

The only indicator that concerns us about people in other religious traditions is whether they demonstrate compassion or not. And even then, the compassion and idea of compassion in other traditions is crippled and limited. Otherwise, Buddhists and nonBuddhists have nothing in common, other than our common humanity.

Nope, unlike other systems, dependent origination is a matter of direct perception, which requires no speculation at all. Anyone can observe it, unlike godhead, etc.

Since other systems are not predicated on dependent origination, they have no actual value in terms of liberation from suffering. 

Paths are either liberative or they are not, it’s not a matter of preference and choice. In Dharma, liberation is strictly defined as freedom from afflictions that result in suffering. No special mystical experience is required to verify this.

Practicing Dharma eliminates the afflictions of desire, hatred, and ignorance that are the cause of all suffering in the world, and the root of that is seeing that there is nothing in the world that is not dependently originated, therefore, empty. That insight into emptiness and dependent origination directly incinerates the afflictions that cause suffering. 

This is the unique teaching of the Buddha. 

I understand there are other alternatives out there, but as far as I am concerned, unless they make people more compassionate, their theoretical content is just so much hot air with no substance. They certainly cannot lead to the insight bequeathed to us by the Buddha.

It appears you are saying without engaging in and practicing theistic traditions on their own terms, we cannot have any basis for accepting or rejecting their liberative value. 

Since it is the case that the ultimate truth can only be understood on the basis of conventional truth, there is no direct or intuitive way that an ordinary person can detour around the conventionally-ascertained ultimate truth, in order to realize it properly. The reason for this is that there is nothing beyond the ultimate truth of conventional entities to realize at all. There is no ultimate truth to be realized beyond the true nature of compounded entities, since space and the two kinds of cessation are the only types of uncompounded phenomena.

Based on this fact we can dispense with the fantasy that theistic traditions are anything but nests of wrong view and confusion. This is because dependent origination and emptiness are found only in the Buddha’s teaching, and not in the teachings of other doctrines. They have no equivalents which would allow us to extend them the charity of allowing that their teachings lead to liberation. But it’s also not our job to correct then. As HHDL said, emptiness is none of their business.

The other possible consequence to your statement is that view doesn’t matter at all. But this is similar to claiming seed oil can be extracted from pressing sand.

Nonbuddhists have all kind experiences which they regard as profound and spiritually transformational. But these experiences, categorically, lead them no closer to liberation.

There is no dependent origination which is separate from dependently originated things; and since there is no beginning to dependent origination-since nothing arises from itself, from another, or in absence of a cause-there is is no reason to assume that dependent origination will ever cease.

Covid Has Killed 5 Million People, But Only Hundreds Have Been Autopsied

To get a clearer picture of the virus’s aftermath, pathologists are pushing to resurrect a dying practice.
By Jason Gale

In an air-locked chamber in the world’s largest research hospital, Daniel Chertow and a half-dozen doctors and scientists clad in astronaut-inspired protective gear are carrying out a microscopic search inside a 26-year-old man.

The patient went to the hospital with chest pain in spring 2020. He didn’t have typical Covid-19 symptoms, but Chertow wants to study him as part of a broader mission to understand where in the body the coronavirus goes and what it does in each of those places. If you’re a Covid case in Chertow’s emerging pathogens lab, you’re not there for treatment; you’re the subject of an autopsy.

The man died at the hospital and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, so he doesn’t fit the definition of a Covid-related fatality. He succumbed to viral myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Chertow’s sleuthing points to the coronavirus as the culprit and offers clues about a rare inflammatory condition that occurs mostly in children after a mild case of Covid.&nbsp;

“They show up later with sometimes life-threatening inflammation in different organs,” Chertow says over Zoom from his office at the National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md. “In a way, he fits into that category, so what’s driving that?”

An autopsy provides a snapshot of what’s occurred at the moment a patient has died, enabling pathologists to infer what happened up to that point. By comparing a large number of autopsies on Covid patients at different time courses, scientists can begin to assemble something akin to a record&nbsp;of the virus’s journey through the body and the disease that&nbsp;arose&nbsp;in its wake.&nbsp;

Autopsies were a cornerstone of medical discoveries for more than two millennia, but sophisticated diagnostic tools and health-system budget cuts have made them a dying practice. Among the first 4 million fatal Covid cases worldwide, only several hundred autopsy findings were reported in international medical journals.&nbsp;

Several scientists are pushing to raise those numbers.&nbsp;“It’s critically important that thousands of autopsies are done, so we can put this picture together,” says Jeffery Taubenberger, a pathologist who heads the viral pathogenesis and evolution section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda. “What we’re trying to figure out here is, what goes wrong under the worst circumstances where people die—to try to understand how the virus causes disease in less severe cases. And then:&nbsp;What are the therapeutic implications of that?”

The National Institutes of Health is spending $1.15 billion over four years to learn about the aftereffects of Covid-19, including a&nbsp;push to conduct more autopsies. Answers are urgently needed. At least 1 in 10 survivors of the disease experience what the World Health Organization calls “post Covid-19 condition”—a constellation&nbsp;of symptoms that can debilitate sufferers for months.&nbsp;

“The post-Covid stuff is very, very real,” says Chertow, a 47-year-old critical care physician. “If you’re going to begin to conceive of ways to prevent or treat those manifestations, you need to understand what’s driving it.”

Authorities were concerned in the panic-stricken early months of the pandemic that dissecting coronavirus-infected patients could spread the infection, resulting in at least half of the autopsy units in the U.S. being shut down, according to L. Maximilian Buja, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Texas’s McGovern Medical School in Houston.
Buja, who finished his pathology training in 1972, co-led a call to action for detailed autopsies on Covid victims in April 2020 and kept his own academic center’s autopsy suites open. That enabled him to report findings from one of the earliest autopsy case series that showed the propensity for the coronavirus to cause tiny clots to form in patients’ blood.&nbsp;

“I take some credit, or partial credit, for getting across the idea that clinically, we need to institute early anticoagulation therapy,” he says. “We have glimmers of knowledge that have contributed to improved treatment for the patients, but there’s a lot more we have to learn. The key to this is to continue to do the autopsy investigations.”

Hamburg forensic pathologist Klaus Puschel defied Germany’s official recommendation to avoid autopsies, permitting 80 comprehensive post-mortem exams on fatal cases in March and April 2020. The findings showed SARS-CoV-2 can spread beyond the respiratory tract to affect the heart, kidney, liver, and brain.&nbsp;

A study Puschel co-authored that was&nbsp;published&nbsp;in October based on 17 autopsies showed the infection was associated with an increased number of defective capillaries in the brain that may explain the cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and fatigue experienced by at least a subset of long Covid patients. The authors also found that an experimental drug&nbsp;known as a RIPK1 inhibitor&nbsp;could potentially avert the damage if given to Covid patients during the acute phase of the&nbsp;illness.
Researchers in Norway showed in July that individuals who tested positive for the coronavirus eight months earlier were almost five times more likely than uninfected people to report memory problems. The NIH’s Chertow says he’s concerned about what such health effects may lead to in the future.&nbsp;
“Is there going to be some subclinical effects on your brain that are going to cause neurocognitive issues later in life that perhaps are not immediately noticeable or detectable?” he says. “If you’re going to begin to conceive of ways to prevent or treat those manifestations—either in the next group that might be exposed or among the group that are suffering—you need to understand what the drivers are.”

Chertow, who also trained as a disease detective with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s epidemic intelligence service, says he was inspired to pursue autopsy research&nbsp;from studying Ebola and&nbsp;treating patients with the deadly disease in Liberia in 2014. “It started with this idea that first&nbsp;[we’ve] got to go find where this virus is going—what it’s doing in those places—and then we’ve got to try to link it back to what we’re seeing clinically.”

Chertow helped identify the role of the salivary glands in SARS-CoV-2&nbsp;transmission.&nbsp;He sees more valuable clues about the virus’s distribution across the body among the more than 10,000 biospecimens his team has collected from 44 fatal cases since April 2020. The post-mortem exams and dissections take three&nbsp;hours in a secure facility that’s required&nbsp;for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease. Bioengineers on the NIH campus custom-built an enclosure that fits over the head and shoulders of the deceased to contain aerosols when the top of the skull is removed.
The seven or so doctors, scientists, and technicians working inside the autopsy suite wear multiple layers of personal protective equipment, says David Kleiner, chief of the post-mortem section of the National Cancer Institute, who worked with Chertow on the research. Usually a plastic apron is worn over a surgical gown, over an impermeable coverall, over surgical scrubs. Sometimes arm-sleeve protectors are worn. Investigators also don three pairs of gloves and two pairs of shoe coverings. And instead of N95 face masks, they breathe&nbsp;through controlled air-purifying respirators, which provide HEPA-filtered air under a hood that fits over their head and shoulders.

It’s cumbersome, but that’s not the only aspect of these Covid autopsies that makes the work painstaking. “We’re sampling way above and beyond what is done in any sort of typical autopsy,” Chertow says. Samples are taken from almost 100 different regions of the body and brain.&nbsp;
And for each one of those areas, adjacent pieces of tissue are also collected and preserved in different ways that are amenable to different methods of analysis, including whether the virus is capable of replicating in the sites from which it’s collected. “We’ve done, simply put, a much more extensive sampling than others have,” he says.

That&nbsp;partly reflects&nbsp;the diminishing capability to perform autopsies outside of academic and medical examiner settings.

“Autopsies are expensive procedures,” says Linda Isles, head of forensic pathology services at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne. “In reality, not many people want to spend money on dead people.” Private autopsy fees vary widely, but typically&nbsp;cost&nbsp;$2,000 to&nbsp;$4,000 in Maryland.

Doctors are ordering fewer autopsies, relying instead on lower-cost X-rays, MRI scans, and other tests to ascribe the cause of a patient’s death. This means pathologists have less experience performing post-mortem exams. In addition, autopsy facilities are expensive to maintain at a safe standard, Isles says.&nbsp;

“So it’s this spiral of decreased experience—and therefore decreasing confidence—and then underutilization of the facilities&nbsp;leading to some of the facilities essentially being mothballed,” she says. “And then when you want to reinstitute them, they’re no longer really safe for modern practice.”
Isles, who finished medical school at the University of Tasmania more than 20 years ago, performed 200 to 300 autopsies during her pathology training. “That might not seem like very many,” she says, “but if you compare that to anatomical pathology trainees now, then that is a very large amount.”
In 1918, doctors performed thousands of autopsies on victims of the Spanish flu and shared their findings widely in illustrated reports, says Taubenberger at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It’s terrible that here we are with our ability to do advanced molecular studies and advanced imaging studies, and yet so few autopsy studies are being done,” he says. “That’s really the tragedy.”

There is no source, no pure love, or anything like it. The highest manifestation of consciousness is a person who has realized how things are 100%, in other words, a buddha. 

Now, to the extent that Buddhas are motivated by love, the wish that sentient beings be happy, we can say they are embodiments of love. But there is nothing at all mysterious about that, just as there is nothing mysterious about a mother’s love for an only child.

Dharma is not a via negativa. Dependent origination = emptiness. 

Inexpressibility simply means that we cannot point to anything and declare “this is how this appearance is.” It means there is nothing behind the relative to describe, and it means that descriptions of appearances fail to capture the reality of those appearances. But there is certainly nothing behind nor beyond them, just as there is nothing behind a mirage, illusion, etc., but causes and conditions that lack inherent existence themselves.

Well, Chapelle does bring this up. "Race" is a cultural and regional marker, not biological marker.

And here is the difference—unlike sex, of which there are basically three, there is only one human race. We are all the same species, the same genus. There are differences in skin tone, hair texture, and eye color, and these are rather recent developments in human evolution, within the past 40,000 years. 

If you are making the point that a white person might have a marked preference for jazz, blues, etc., and this might be a result of a karmic trace from a previous like time as a black person, maybe, but unlikely, given the rarity of human birth.

My friend's cousin contracted covid. He lost his sense of smell and had a headache for an afternoon, next day fine. No symptoms after this. 

Move forward a year, has major medical event, unrelated to covid, unrelated to his lungs, or anything (kidney problems), and when they look at the results of his tomography, the damage to his lungs was extensive, and the pathologist agreed that damage was indeed from covid. 

There will be many more instances of such cases. The reason we are not hearing about them now, is that finding this damage requires sophisticated imaging, and that is something which HMOs are unwilling to pay for in the US, but in Mexico it is very cheap.

For me there is no discomfort. Most of what we consider to be "visionary" is a product of experiential vision of yogis. Below the path of seeing these are mostly uncomfortable because the nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindu in our body are stuck, frozen, and not pliable. For those who have attained the path of seeing and so on in previous lifetimes, they have a difference experience of yoga, and thus, their visionary experiences seem more incredible. 

If you have ever wondered why advanced yogis die painless deaths, it is because they have unravelled the nāḍīs which the vāyus and bindus to move freely within their bodies. It basically amounts to plumbing. Our pipes are clogged, theirs are not.

It is some years before he begins to reveal termas, after he does some retreats, especially Mañjuśrī Simhanada. 

As for his claim that he did not receive view and meditation from any human lama, no one receives the view and meditation from anyone. We receive transmissions, but the view and meditation we must discover for ourselves. So I do not find his claim to be as extraordinary as others do.

While it is true that one cannot fix samsara, striving to make others happy is not fruitless or worthless. It is an end in itself. I suggest you study the Bodhicarya-avatara. 

Bodhisattvas engage in three main forms of generosity: material generosity, the generosity of freedom from fear, and the generosity of Dharma. 

In general, seeking to make the world a safer place, in what limited ways we can, makes it possible to practice Dharma. One notes that the places where Dharma flourishes most today are places where Democracy is a high value. It is true there are a couple of toy kingdoms like Sikkim and Bhutan, but they survive only due to the grace of India's protection from the PRC, and they emulate the British constitutional monarchy now, thus, democratic. They are incapable of protecting themselves. Thailand can protect itself, but its government is rife with corruption, as is its sangha over all. Buddhism is repressed in countries like Russia, not to mention China, and other dictatorships like Vietnam, etc. 

Buddhism itself is essentially anarchistic, and the idea of a supreme head of anything in the Sangha at large was quashed by the Buddha in the beginning.

All of the information I have provided to you is sourced from authoritative tantras in Kenjur, and their commentaries which one can find in the Tengyur, as well as the Naropa oral tradition. 

The compiler of the tantras is Vajrapāṇi. There are many emanations of Vajrapāṇi, but in particular, the Indrabhūtis, all three, are regarded as Vajrapāṇi emanations and are predicted in the Tantras, and they too all had human gurus. In the case of the first, it was Śākyamuni Buddha, the later two had different gurus. 

You seem to think I am making an argument that transmissions through visions and dreams are impossible. I never said that. But ordinary people have to be ripened by human gurus. There is no precedent at all for an ordinary human being to have some kind of visionary empowerment from an awakened being. Such an idea represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the paths and stages. A nirmāṇakāya is an awakened being in the form of an ordinary human being, for example, Śākyamuni Buddha; his voice is the sambhogakāya, and his mind is the dharmakāya. Not even tenth stage bodhisattvas can perceive the dharmakāya. Only buddhas can perceive this. 

Even then, the account of Tilopa in the Life Stories of the 84 Mahāsiddhas by Abhayadatta is sure to disappoint. He describes Tilopa as a pandita and a court priest, who becomes disgusted when he recognizes that when he gives teachings, everyone is distracted. He then leaves for a charnel ground outside of Kañci where he begs for alms and practices. He then meets Naropa, who provides Tilopa with provisions for the next ten years, after which time, Tilopa attains mahāmudra siddhi. He departs to deva realms where he continues to practice, and attains the siddhis of body, speech, and mind, and eventually physically departed to Khecari realm. So according to this this account, when Naropa first met Tilopa, the latter had not even attained siddhi. 

My question to you is this: can your mind comprehend that there are different accounts? Or is the "Mah lineage" the only one that matters to you. Because if it is the latter, what makes you any different than a fundamentalist Christian?

Cakrasamvara does not come through Śākyamuni at all. 

Why? Because the Cakrasamvara mandala still exists in this world in the 24 places, it was never closed unlike Hevajra, Guhyasamāja, Kālacakra, etc., and in these 24 places the nirmāṇakāya is still teaching this mandala (its one of the reasons it is so effective in this age). And of course, the nirmānakāya is inseparable from the sambhogkāya and the dharmakāya. In any case, this transmission was bestowed by Vajradhara upon Vajrapāṇi. Vajrapāṇi is a tenth stage bodhisattva, but he is also a human being, as is the nirmāṇakāya who teaches in the 24 places. So it is an unbroken human lineage, all the way back to nirmāṇakāya Śrī Heruka Vajradhara in the 24 places. 

Now, Vajrapāṇi bestowed this upon Saraha at Śrīparvata in S. India along with the root tantra. etc., the latter in turn transmitted this to Nāgārjuna in S. India and the rest is history.

You are certainly entitled to your own story, just don't confuse stories with facts. 

We actually have quite of bit of information about Tilopa, his career, his teachers, his practices, and so on. But if you want to obliterate them because "Mah lineage," there is nothing I can do about that.

The example of King Jah is a very poor one, actually, and is much disputed. There isn't even a tantra called The Continuation of the Śrī Samvarodaya Tantra. Instead the citation comes from one of the Anuyoga Tantras. 

Also the tale about Nāgārjuna is just so much gossip. Sonam Tsemo (1142-1182) writes in the  General Presentation of Tantras:

Some claim “The Hevajra Tantra was revealed by the great master called ‘Dombi Heruka.” Others claim “Master Nāgārjuna stole it disguised as an idiot” These are a source of laughter. 

How are these a source of laughter?  The masters will be slandered because there is no magical power to be attained from stealing on the first bodhisattva stage. The ḍākinīs will be slandered because how would the caretaker of the books not recognize Nāgārjuna, the theft, and so on? Our own Dharma will be slandered because the lineage would be from a stolen book. 

Likewise, the Mahāmāya Tantra was revealed by master Kukuripa...

No, one cannot. This is a farce. No empowerment, no guru yoga. Guru yoga is a practice only found in unsurpassed yoga tantra. It does not exist in the lower tantras nor does it exist in sūtra. The permission to practice guru yoga only comes from receiving the unsurpassed yoga tantra empowerment in full or alternately, with direct introduction of Dzogchen or Mahāmudrā. 

Can one supplicate the Buddha, the great bodhisattvas, and important teachers of the past? Is there merit in that? Yes and yes. But this is not guru yoga. 

The essence of guru yoga resides in the living connection one has with one's guru and the merging of the guru's body, speech, and mind with one's own body, voice, and mind forged through empowerment. That living connection is based on the transmission of the special gnosis one receives at the time of empowerment. Without this introduction, there is no basis for the practice of guru yoga at all. 

Even in practices such as the guru yogas of Milarepa, Padmasambhava, and so on, the point is that while the form of the guru is in the aspect of this or that historical teacher, the essence is one's own root guru. This point is extremely important. Our root gurus are the conduit through which we are able to access the true blessings and empowerment of the lineage going back to Buddha Vajradhāra. This is why it is so important to maintain pure samaya and so on.

Kagyus do not own Tilopa anymore than they own Naropa. I would say that quite frankly, you are making arguments from a paucity of information. There are many histories of the Cakrasamvara lineage which you can read, if you know Tibetan. I think you will be surprised at what you discover, and much of your present certainty will vanish.

Amazing. You are deferring to opinions on  mere hearsay, opinions you have not even read for yourself.

By the way,I have no qualms about supplicating masters from the past, I do it everyday, but the idea that one can arbitrarily decide Tilopa is one’s root guru because you don’t have sufficient faith in your actual guru is just pathetic. This is the sort thing that harms the teachings.

We do not just accept such statements uncritically. 

The idea you can decide some teacher in the past whom you never met is now your root guru is ridiculous on its face, and I honestly don’t care who claims it to be so. There is no valid precedent for this. One can never receive empowerment from such a person. For the same reason no one alive today can claim the Buddha is their root guru, abd one certainly cannot hope to find a more perfect teacher than the Buddha.

Tilopa's mahāmudrā realization came about as a result of his own meditation on the creation and completion stage systems of Cakrasamvara, which he received from his guru, Vijaya. Tilopa was originally a kṣatriya, ordained as a bhikṣu, was called Prajñābhadra, become a paṇḍita, and was ordered by Mahāsiddha Vijaya to become a sesame pounder. Since Tilopa realized mahāmudrā, there is no fault or contradiction with the idea that he also received teachings and transmissions directly from Buddha Vajradhara. But he started as an ordinary person, no different from you or me. Indeed, there is a Vajravārāhī sadhana in the Tengyur authored by him under the name "Prajñābhadra."

All I can tell you is how ChNN practiced. One, he did unite all gurus into one, and this is appropriate. This is also how I practice. 

But when he was practicing a specific practice, such as Zhitro of Namcho, he would bring to mind that guru from whom he received that transmission, Gongkar Rinpoche; or when practicing Adzom Drukpa's Tāra, Gyalsey Gyurme Dorje; etc., or Simhamukha, Ayu Khandro, etc. 

So there is no contradiction here, and indeed, it strengthens one's connection to the practice. So for example, if I practice any practice, I unite all gurus there, and I also recall specifically the guru from whom I received it. I try not to play favorites with my gurus.

Title: Re: Making sense of types of thought

Well, that's not the point really. The imputation itself is the agent and recipient of action, that's the point. Otherwise, one faces the contradiction of asserting that something real passes from this life to the next (consciousness), but we know that nothing at all passes from this life to the next. Certainly other Mādhyamikas make allowances for this and are prepared admit consciousness is an appropriate basis of imputation for a self, which can pass from this life to the next, and is the agent and recipient of action, conventionally speaking, but Candra will not go that far:

MAV, verse 6:162

Likewise, the self is asserted to be the appropriator
in dependence on the aggregates, sense elements,
and sense basis that worldly acknowledge—
appropriation is the action, this is also the agent.

The commentary clarifies:

Although the self is not defined as a mundane convention in relative truth, but like a chariot, it is asserted to be the appropriator.

The next three passages bring the point to bear well. Not sure what translation you are using, but the Padmakara version is fuzzy on this point. 

So, this is a special point of Candrakīrti's which one can discover more fully discussed by Gorampa in his Differentiation of Views.

Correct. The difference between rnam pa, aspect, and ngo bo, essence. The aspect can be whatever the sadhana is; the essence is always one's own root guru/s (yes, there can be more than one guru if you have received the same practice from more than one guru).

Yes. There are three basic kind of gurus, empowerment gurus, reading transmission gurus, and explanation gurus. The one from whom one receives all three is called "a supreme guru." One has samaya with all three kinds of gurus, incidentally. It's very important to realize that receiving vajrayāna lungs and explanations from lamas also carry commitments. This is why it is important to receive these things from the proper sources.


People are very promiscuous with the Dharma these days and will just go to any lama and receive any kind of empowerment, lung, and explanation without checking out anything. They will spend days and months agonizing about what kind of school to go to, what kind of car to buy, what kind of partner to have, but when it comes to the Dharma, they seem to be content with the first thing that comes along without any investigation at all. It's really sad.

The essence of an empowerment is the arrangement of a special dependent origination by the master upon the disciple according to the methods taught by Buddha Vajradhara in the authoritative tantras, realized by mahāsiddhas, practiced by bodhisattvas, and translated by qualified translators out of Sanskrit and other dialects of India in Tibetan, and thence into English and other languages. There is no other essence than this.

These days however, people take it upon them themselves to just make up whatever doctrine feels good to them, disregarding the clear words of the sūtras and tantras about how to follow a virtuous mentor or a guru. They buy books and attempt to practice their contents without transmission. Such people close the doorway to liberation for themselves by inappropriately using methods taught in the tantras.
