Don't be silly. We have been in the "last five hundred years" of the Buddha's teaching for over a thousand years. Sakya Pandita thought he was living in the last five hundred years, and so on. It is a trope, it needn't be taken literally.

Sure you can. But even when you have them in the Gelug forum, there are also people who have strange ideas about them who claim to be Gelugpas, so what to do? 

You should, at some point, just reconcile yourself to the notion that Tsongkhapa's ideas are at minimum controversial (it is why he is so famous). When someone comes along as raises an objection you don't want to deal with, ignore it, unless they are being too disruptive.

Frankly, it is precisely because Tibetans have so muddied the water with their own controversies and disputes, I generally tell folks they should study the original Indian texts first, Tibetan polemics later (if there is any need). If you listen to some people, no one before Tsongkhapa understood Madhyamaka before him(including Candrakīrti), so it makes you wonder how all those realized people became realized before he emanated to straighten everyone out.

This is the basic problem in Buddhist intellectual history: to whit, when Nāgārjuna was writing, there was general hostility in Buddhist circles to what we now call "logic," (Pramāṇa), as it evidenced in Nāgārjuna's Vigrahavyāvartanī, as well as some controversy over the notion of what exactly an intrinsic characteristic (svalakṣana) is. For pre-Pramāṇa Buddhism, the idea of svalakṣana was identical to the idea of svabhāva, to give you an example, heat is both the svabhāva as well as the svalakṣana of fire. Many Śrāvaka Buddhists regarded svalakṣanas as ultimate truths. 

Enter the Prāmāṇikas such as Dignaga and Dharmakīrti. They used the term "svalakṣana" in a way distinct from the usage that was attacked by Nāgārjuna. They used the term merely to describe the identifying characteristics of a given object such as the blueness of a blue vase, without imposing upon this svalakṣana the idea it was somehow an ultimate truth or entity. Instead, for the Prāmāṇikas, a svalakṣana is merely the simplest percept we can perceive, one that we perceive without concepts. 

Bhavaviveka was a post-Pramāṇa author, and by his time, the conventions of Pramāṇa has become so widespread in scholarly Buddhist discourse, that he took Buddhapalita to task in one spot in his MMK commentary for ignoring those conventions (this is Bhavaviveka's real fault). In reply to this, Candrakīrti, also conversant in the conventions of Pramāṇa, decided that Bhavaviveka was being quite unfair, and defended Buddhapalita's original formulation. But this dispute between the two of them should not cause us to ignore Bhavaviveka's enduring and important contributions to the Madhyamaka tradition, and sadly, today it is the case that his contribution has been marginalized precisely because of an overall Tibetan lack of attention to the intellectual history of Indian Buddhism.

1) This thread is not in the Gelug Forum. It is in the General Dharma forum. 

2) What bothers me about this conversation is that no discussion of Tsongkhapa's views can take apparently take place without slandering one of the great Mādhyamaka authors by name and without grossly distorting his views.

3) The fact that you are not properly distinguishing svalakṣana, which here is incorrectly translated as "intrinsic existence," from svabhāva, here translated as "inherent existence," is just one of the myriad problems this conversation faces. 

4) The four tenet system is indeed part of Buddhist intellectual history. It is not just a war game where one can try out intellectual strategies and tactics. The purpose of learning about the four tenet systems and so on is not to increase false concepts (which is what happens when one does not get things right), but rather to reduce one's false concepts altogether (thus necessitating getting things right). This cannot happen when one is cultivating false concepts about that object or that person being refuted.

But this is not the actual difference between Bhava and Buddhapalita, which hinges solely on a pedagogical distinction based on the former's criticism of the latter for not using a formal syllogism to refute the Saṃkhya position of arising from self in the latter's prolegomena in his commentary on the MMK.

The idea that inherent existence is the sole object of negation is a key feature of Tsongkhapa's thinking. This is his interpretation of a key feature of Candrakīriti's thinking, i.e., that the negation of inherent existence was common to both Mahāyāna and Śrāvaka tenet systems. What Tsongkhapa neglected was that the uncommon Mahāyāna formulation of emptiness however is the systematic negation of the four extremes. This is not found in Śrāvaka tenet systems at all. As a consequence, the followers of Tsongkhapa deride the profound Mahāyāna emptiness of freedom extremes as promulgated in Tibet by Batshab Nyima Drag (the translator of Candrakīrti's major works into Tibetan).

You are making a classic error. There are many kinds of Dzogchen practice that must be done in complete secrecy. Secret Mantra is called "secret" for a reason.

If you want to practice the two stages there is a precise way followed by those who became mahasiddhas. Even Guru Rinpoche observed the principles of strict practice when it came to Phurba and so on.

If you are doing a formal practice of approach and accomplishment, you need your mala. If you are doing any kind of serious practice, you need your mala. However, if you are doing a short thun, for example, in ChNN's system, you don't need a mala because you are not counting the recitations. If you are counting, you need, if you are not counting, you don't. Still, it is better to use a mala when reciting mantras.

Thugs rje, compassion, is the basis for the arising of the nirmanakāya. For example, the commentary on the Realms and Transformation of Sound Tantra states:

Thugs is the affection (brtse ba) in the heart for sentient beings. Rje is
the arising of a special empathy (gdung sems) for them.

And:

When analyzed, there is the compassion that exists in the basis, the compassion that appears on the path, and the compassion of the perfected result.

Among those, since the compassion that exists on the path is undivided, it exists as the basis for the arising of the diversity. Since it is undisclosed, it has no activities.

There is the compassion that appears on the path. From among the three pristine consciousnesses of the basis, since the essence is intrinsically pure, [compassion] is not disclosed in any way. Since the nature self-appears, compassionate deeds are diverse. Since all beings are pervaded by compassion, compassion seems to appear as the one who tames those to be tamed.

The compassion of the perfected result intrinsically exists in the dharmakāya, comes from invocation and supplication to the sambhogakāya, and is produced when the nirmāṇakāya meets conditions and objects.

Pandita Vimalamitra states in his commentary on the Secret Tantra Without Syllables:

Even if vidyā could be found through the imputation and scrutiny of intellectual analysis, it cannot be stabilized by necessary cultivation because it cannot be known whether one has indeed found vidyā or not. Therefore, in the beginning, a pure guru is very important. Afterwards, one’s own cultivation and familiarity is very important.

I can understand why you see it that way. I think it is bit more complicated than that, however. 

During the Cold War, most Americans thought that our governments actions were totally justified in the face of the spread of communism. It was not the case that Americans sought to deflect blame, they actually supported our actions overseas and abroad (including the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki).

Now, most Americans, once they woke up from the fog of 9/11, realize that the Iraq War was deeply wrong, even those who voted for Trump. Many Americans understand that the destruction of Libya was wrong. And Syria is not on us, that's on Assad and Putin, despite our blunders with respect to the the Syrian opposition. The Iraqis would not give US troops immunity, so we pulled them all out in 2011, hence ISIS.

Dharmatā means a number of thing, depending on context. In logic is refers to the predicate of an argument, for example, the dharmin, water, has the dharmatā, wetness. 

When used in as it is being used here, it refers to one's own nature.

The Diamond Sūtra states, famously:

Anyone who sees me as form, 
anyone who knows me as sound,
engage in mistaken effort.
Those people who do not see me,
see the dharmatā of the buddhas. 
Since the dharmakāya of the guides
is not a knowable entity,
it cannot be known.

The creation stage is not necessary as many Indian scholars such as Śri Simha and so on have argued. In the Śrīsarvaguhyavidhigarbhālaṃkāra-nāma, Mañjuśrīkīrti records their position:

The teaching of the creation stage and its means of conduct are taught as methods for refuting annihilationists, for proponents of the dependently originated result, and for some worldly people who are terrified of the profound meaning. Utterly pure, perfect buddhahood itself is an inconceivable pristine consciousness. Since that cannot arise from a dissimilar cause, here, emptiness —which is not perceptible as a sign, inconceivable, and the eliminator proliferation— is the supreme result that possessed when the yogi relies on the absence of thoughts. 

Of course he complains that these Dzogchen practitioners have an invalid point of view, but this is because he does not understand the meaning of "absence of thoughts," in this case, the absence of thoughts referred refers to the nonconceptual direct perception of dharmatā. The latter does not require the creation stage since dharmatā is innate.

The mother line is called the khrag rgyud, the "blood line." The father line is called rus brgyud, the "bone line."

This is based on the fact that the father's elements contributes to the formation of bone tissue, nerves and so on; while the mother's elements contributes to the development of flesh, muscle, blood and so on.

In general in traditional Tibetan society, no one would dream of calling themselves a Ngakpa based on having received an empowerment, or even a hair empowerment. 

Ngakpas are people who have shown some juice from their practice of mantra. When I see some practitioners who develop some real juice in their practice, then I will call them ngakpas. Until then, for me, they are just earnest practitioners with aspirations. 

My teachers, Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje and Kunzang Dechen Lingpa (both "heart sons" of Dudjom Rinpoche who were with him in Tibet for many years) demonstrated the juice of their practice. The former did several years of retreat on Throma in remote caves in Kongpo, the latter did one week of Vajrakīlaya practice and achieved siddhi (the latter was recognized by Dudjom Rinpoche as the tulku of Terton Longsal Nyingpo). 

Ordinations do not create Ngakpas, siddhis do. That is my main point here. Since I do not have siddhis, I don't call myself a Ngakpa, even though I have all the requisite empowerments and so on.

Good luck piercing the aristocratic foundation of the Ngakpa tradition. In Tibet, in terms of one's reputation, one's family comes first, then one's teacher, then one's personal qualities. 

For example, I have seen doctors presented as good teachers (who were horrible actually) because their qualities were listed in that order. It really does not fit with the egalitarian model you have in your head, Greg, that "anyone" become a Ngakpa in the traditional Tibetan sense. For example, my teacher, the famed late Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje (d. 1993], made it quite clear that not everyone could just become a weather controller. In order to become a weather controller, you have to have the ability in your bone lineage (father line).

Nirmanakāyas have physical bodies, which suffer from erosion, just like ours do. In the Mahaparinibbana sutta it is said:

But when the Blessed One had entered upon the rainy season, there arose in him a severe illness, and sharp and deadly pains came upon him. And the Blessed One endured them mindfully, clearly comprehending and unperturbed..."Now I am frail, Ananda, old, aged, far gone in years. This is my eightieth year, and my life is spent. Even as an old cart, Ananda, is held together with much difficulty, so the body of the Tathagata is kept going only with supports. It is, Ananda, only when the Tathagata, disregarding external objects, with the cessation of certain feelings, attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind, [19] that his body is more comfortable."

Things are neither pure nor impure, "pure and impure" are the dualistic concepts of sentient beings. Buddhas see shit, they just don't relate to it as impure or something to avoid, nor to they relate to gold as something pure to acquire. 

Since this is case, if you insist that Buddhas in the human realm do not see water (or do not see pus and blood in a preta realm), I think you are deluded and you do not understand the meaning of conventional truth. 

If on the other hand you opine that buddhas do not perceive phenomena such as shit and gold in terms of purity or impurity, then I can go along with this. But to believe that buddhas live in a comic book world of pure lands is naive beyond belief, and it means, as far as I am concerned, you have not understood the real import of the generation stage nor the completion stage.

And while it is true that anyone can take some vow and not cut their hair, that is not really what a ngakpa is. A real ngakpa is someone who actually has some realization, someone who has at least generated some heat through practicing Secret Mantra. It is for this reason I don't place very much importance on the so called "ngakpa ordination" or necessarily have a lot of respect for all these people who want to take "ngakpa vows" and go about in religious gear. For example, at base, to really be a candidate for wearing the white lower robe, you must be proficient in tummo, and so on. To really be a candidate for not cutting your hair, you must have the great compassion necessary that ḍākinīs will take up residence in it, etc. Ḍākinīs are not going to inhabit your hair just because you took a vow not to cut it.

No, there is no contradiction. The problem is not appearances, the problem is clinging; so whether a buddha perceives shit or gold, they are regarded them the same way —&nbsp;a buddha regards them without any accepting or rejecting. But it does not mean that a buddha perceives that all shit smells like roses. For a  buddha, roses smell like roses and shit smells like shit.

I can't comment on the Oḍḍiyāna thing, it is very unclear. There is a strong Indian tradition that witches (ḍākinīs) live the Swat region, perhaps because many people there have blue eyes and red hair. Further, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu maintains that it was in Pakistan. So what to do? 

In terms of Ngapa dress, I have said many times that Ngakpas are kind of like the brahmins of Tibetan society, fulfilling many of the same functions. In Thiland, for example, there are brahmins and this is how they appear:





Like Brahmins, in Tibet we have family Ngakpa lineages, which are generally held to be very important. For example, this person is something like the head Ngakpa:



It is fine by me if people like to wear outfits when they practice. I have no need for it personally. What other people do is their business, not mine. But I do like to use an indian blanket to keep warm if the room is a little cold:

Every empowerment has specific samayas connected with specific empowerments, for example, the reason why Padmasambhava carries a skull cup and a vajra is that these articles are samaya commitments for Śrī Heruka, his main yidam. 

Cakrasamvara and Yoginī practitioners are never supposed to be separate from the bone implements and so on, and so often they carry around a little card with representations of these items. 

Thus, that mantrins, whether lay or ordained, have articles of samaya they are supposed to carry about with them is not an exception, it is instead the rule.

There are three things: realization, liberation, full awakening. 

Having a realization is not equivalent to liberation. There are many realizations one must have before one enters the path of seeing. Once one has entered the path of seeing however, one begins the process of liberation that culminates on full awakening, buddhahood, at the end of the tenth bhumi. The fullest account of this, in Mahāyāna is found in the Abhisamaya-alaṃkara.

The process of liberation means gradually abandoning the afflictions which cause rebirth in samsara. Full awakening means omniscience.

There are all kinds of commitments one can undertake, but the idea that one is required, like monastics, to wear special "Ngakpa robes" at all times, is a complete misunderstanding. There are all kinds of Ngakpa styles, short haired, long haired, monastic, dread-locked, etc. 

For many Tibetans, the term sngags pa really just means, "lay people with long hair who practice rituals, eat meat, drink booze, and chase girls." While among western Nyingmapas, Ngakpas are revered with near comical devotion, the situation among Tibetans is just not the same, just as Indians do not really think that sadhus are all that. Also, as you point out, there is no market for western Ngakpas, not really. Though there are some who go around and try to cultivate markets for their services, some more successful, some less, the fact is that the Ngakpa tradition as a whole serves a segment of the Tibetan population with rites that in some respect are not really proper for monks to engage in, such as divination, hail prevention, and so on. As you astutely point out, there is no baked in demand for Ngakpa services in the West. I just don't see Ngakpas replacing Evangelical Christian prayer circles for driving out demons and so on any time soon. Perhaps in Mexico on down to South America, the situation will be a little different. 

Anyway, I keep my own Ngakpa gear tucked away nicely. Maybe some day I will see a reason to put it on, but frankly, I have not seen such a reason for some years.

No, when one has been introduced and recognized the basis, that is sufficient. For example, when one has been introduced to a person, the next time one sees them, one will recognize them. Of course, it is possible to forget their face after some time in a one time meeting, so once one has been introduced to a person, familiarization with that person, going to meet them again and so on, is recommended. 

No one ever claimed that one was able to introduce oneself to the basis, or that having been introduced, there was nothing further to do. But what is stated is that there is nothing that needs to be transformed, changed or otherwise modified as a result of such an introduction. One needs only to familiarize oneself with the subject that was introduced. Indeed, in Dzogchen teachings, vidyā or rig pa is sometimes referred to as "the conditional basis," because vidyā or rig pa is conditional upon introduction and does not exist without it.

The ultimate can be defined. In fact, it is necessary to define it.

If one does not produce heat on the path of application, there is no chance that one will enter the path of seeing. 

Therefore, we have different ways of definining the ultimate such as free from extremes, absence of inherent existence, emptiness, nonorigination and so on.

that of nondefective sense organs and that of defective sense organs.

Hi Greg:

Don't confuse the dramatic play of the nirmanakāya for the erroneous concept of innate awakening. The Lankāvatara Sūtra states:

Buddhahood is not attained in the desire realm,
the final accomplishment is in Akaniṣṭha. 


And:

Perfect buddhahood is attained there,
the emanations attain attain buddhahood here. 

And:

Buddhas do not attain buddhahood in
the desire realm or the formless realm;
free of desire, you attain buddhahood
in the form realm. 

As to the idea that sentient beings are buddhas without knowing it, this is a popular misunderstanding based on looking at the words but not understanding the meaning.

That recognition is itself vidyā, mahāmudra, and prajñapārāmita. 

That recognition is not a consequence of practice nor of meditation, it is a consequence solely of introduction. "Practice" consists of deepening familiarization with that recognition. As the Self-Arising Vidyā Tantra states in Chapter 4:

It exists as something that can be illustrated
to all unrealized sentient beings. 
There is neither arising nor declining

For example, previously one could not recognize gold. However one can recognize gold when instructed in how to recognize it, but that gold is not produced by the recognition. Likewise, previously one could not recognize dharmatā. However one can recognize dharmatā when instructed in how to recognize it, but that dharmatā is not produced by the recognition. 

Unlike gold, however, dharmatā is not a conditioned or compounded entity. Dharmatā does not arise dependent on the introduction. Dharmatā, one's own nature, is present whether or not it is recognized, like the wish-fulfilling gem concealed under the lintel of a pauper's door. 

Just as a gold bed pan or a gold Buddha statue are equally made of gold, when our own nature is not recognized, it is called "the basis." When it is recognized, it is called "the result," but it has itself undergone no transformation at all. For this reason then, the result is never conditioned because the basis is never conditioned. Nonrecognition of the basis is not a fault of the basis, it is a fault of the consciousness which apprehends the basis. When the basis is rightly apprehended, this is called vidyā, rig pa or knowledge. When the basis is incorrectly apprehended, this is called avidyā, ma rig pa, or ignorance.

There are no two truths, Greg. As the Soaring Garuda, one of the five original Dzogchen lungs brought to Tibet by Vairocana states:

there is no further need to explain an “ultimate phenomenon.”

Or as the All-Creating King states:

The one who talks about relative and ultimate—
words of exaggeration and deprecation—
does not understand the meaning of nonduality. 

And:

Since I, the creator of all, have made all Dharmas, 
there is no need for the two truths in my Dharma.

I am pointing out that because of Western Buddhist studies, many Westerners maintain views like Astus, and indeed yourself, which hold that somehow śravakayāna teachings are a foundation or a bedrock, upon which all other Dharma systems must depend. We have unconsciously inherited this idea from the kind of Buddhist historiography we find in the West, in general. 

While such ideas are not absent from traditional hermeneutics, the traditional approach to this in Tibet, for example, is predicated on the three vows, rather than historical analysis of the Pali Canon, the Agamas, and so on, because the traditional sense of Buddhist history does not proceed from the same set of assumptions Westerners use to approach Buddhist history (text critical, etc.). Astus' approach exemplifies the Western approach very well, in his assumption that the Nikāya/Agamas form a layer of teachings earlier than and prior to Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, so that without the former, the latter could not have arisen.

The nine yānas are also a taxonomy, a way of presenting distinct kinds of methodologies. Noone ever claimed they were a "core teaching." The Kagyus however, never dispute the nine yāna presentation, no matter how much it may have been disputed by first Sakyapas, and later, Gelugpas. 

So what might be a core teaching of the Buddha, as opposed to a taxonomy? 

This ambrosial Dharma I have obtained
is deep, peaceful, immaculate, luminous, and unconditioned.

While I recognize this is one way of explaining khregs chod, there is another. According to Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, the term "chod" in khregs chod is an intransitive verb; khregs here refers to a bundle of things; for example, khregs shing refers to a bindle of sticks. Hence the image in use is a bundle whose fastening has come apart on its own, without any agent unfastening it, since the verb has no direct object.

No, Mañjuśrimitra is stating very clearly that there is direct method of realization and an indirect method. Mipham comments here:


If it is asked, “What is the method for realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing at the moon with a finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization. 

In that case, this which is to be explained is the basis or cause of the meditation that generates ultimate awakened mind itself. If it is asked what that is, it is samadhi and mudra. 

Now then, through the power of cultivating the three samadhis of suchness, universal illumination and the cause, [14/a] one will be stable, and not carried away by negative conditions. After the meditation of binding the three symbolic mudras of buddhahood— the body (mahāmudra), the mind (samaya mudra), and the activities (karmamudra)—generate the mind as the great dharmamudra (the symbol of speech). One should then meditate the recitation of the essence mantra.

If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness.

Mahāyāna in general does not promise a rapid path— quite the opposite in fact— but nevertheless promises a higher path than Hinayāna. So long in fact, that by the criteria you suggest, most definitely middling and average practitioners of Mahāyāna will appear afflicted by comparison to even average practitioners of Hinayāna, so that is not a sure means of evaluation of paths.

With respect to liberation, the criteria of liberation is freedom from afflictions. But this also cannot be evaluated from outside. However, liberation is just half the Buddhist path, there is also omniscience. Since this omniscience is primarily defined from knowledge of the paths of awakening, it is also difficult to ascertain from outside. 

The arguments for the efficacy of Vajrayāna over Mahāyāna is based on being an easy path, with many methods, for those of sharp faculties, and so on. 

The argument for the Great Perfection, the summum bonum of all vehicles, is based on the fact that it cannot be ascertained through words and explanations, but only on the basis of the intimate instructions of a guru, which are not (as is commonly misunderstood from the name "intimate instructions," "pith instructions," and so on) solely based on explanations, but are a means of introducing someone to their own state in the form of a direct sensory perception which bypasses conceptual constructs. When a person with the fortune to meet a guru with such a lineage of instructions (assuming that person recognizes the meaning of the intimate instructions which they have been given), they will have no fear of ever falling into three lower realms ever again. 

The point is not to proclaim, "My diamond is unflawed, yours is flawed," the point is to relieve sentient beings from anxiety about being forever trapped in samsara. This is why I reject your charge of triumphalism. If someone thinks that Dzogchen rhetoric is mere triumphalism, they have not understood the point of Dzogchen at all in the first place.

Someone who is not expert in paths will not necessarily be able to distinguish a correct path from an incorrect path, or a superior path from an inferior path. Only some people have the necessary knowledge to make such an evaluation. 

Likewise, someone who is not expert in gems will not necessarily be able to discern a real diamond from a fake diamond, a high quality diamond from a low quality diamond. Only some people have the necessary skills to make such an evaluation. 

Since this is so, the fact that these criteria are only accepted by some Vajrayānis merely indicates that the skill to evaluate all paths is missing from schools other than Vajrayāna, and in particular, the Great Perfection. 

Furthermore, the purpose of evaluating paths is due to the fact that everyone wishes to achieve liberation as rapidly as possible. Likewise, the purpose of evaluating gemstones is due to the fact that everyone wishes to know that they are buying the best quality gem possible.

Trekchö is not a wrathful practice, and it involves no effort. If one is using effort to "cut through" anything, one has not discovered trekchö. 

As to your second question; while wrathful yidams like Kilaya are for dealing with secondary issues, they can also be used as means for discovering the meaning of trekchö. Mañjuśrīmitra writes:

Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

People who, for whatever reason are not capable of directly approaching the meaning of the Great Perfection directly, can do so indirectly via the means of sadhana practice. 

Finally, there are no wrathful practices that do not require empowerment, but having received more or less any Shitro empowerment, from that point onward one only needs the lung and the instructions in order to practice any sadhana.

The claim in Dzogchen is that there are no differences in capacity.  There is no "higher" or "lower." The sole difference between people is whether or not they possess the intimate instruction from their guru. As Zhabkar explains in the Soaring Garuda:

If this is practiced, all will be liberated;
there is no distinction between sharpness and dullness in capacities.
If one practices, even a cowherd will be liberated.
If one understands the significance of the luminosity of one’s mind through direct perception,
the rhetoric of scholars is not necessary here;
just as when one eats molasses,
there  is no need to explain the taste of molasses.

And Mañjuśrīmitra explains that the two truths are the same:

Therefore, because awakening and nonawakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.
In accordance with that meaning, all those explanations 
of the nominal ultimate, the absence of arising and ceasing, sameness, 
nonduality, beyond thought, emptiness, the dharmadhātu, 
freedom from expression and convention, and so on are neither ultimate nor relative.
If it is said, “This is the path in accordance with the ultimate,” that is relative.

The notion of gradual vs. sudden is a self-imposed limitation. Dzogchen does not make a distinction between persons of sharper and duller capacity, for example, unlike lower paths. In Dzogchen, there is no notion that there are some people who cannot understand the meaning of Dzogchen. 

There is only the notion that there are people who either have not had the fortune of meeting Dzogchen teachings or whose own conceptuality regarding cause and effect, and so on, prevent them from embracing Dzogchen teachings whole-heartedly. 

Once a person decides to embrace Dzogchen teachings and is willing to dispense with the conceptual limitations about buddhahood imposed by the paths of cause and result, there is no obstacle placed in the way of people who wish to learn about Dzogchen teachings. Dzogchen teachings make no distinction between persons of sharper and duller capacity as I mentioned above. A proper teacher is all that one requires to follow Dzogchen teachings. 

Any teacher who claims that Dzogchen requires one to be a person of high capacity, etc., frankly, does not know what they are talking about and should be immediately understood as a person of very limited understanding of Dzogchen teachings. 

On the other hand, there are today teachers who use the name "Dzogchen" to defraud students into following them, who then never give actual teachings on Dzogchen, or who are given mistaken teachings on Dzogchen. So, caveat emptor.

Who can consider Vinaya reliable since it is embedded in ancient gender disparities between men and women? How are they even relevant today? 

Even the way the vow against sexual misconduct is formulated (even where I agree with it) is a reflection of patriarchal economic values embedded in property relations and principally refers to male sexual conduct. The formulation of bhikṣuni vows is clearly oppressive towards women since they must follow an additional 111 extra vows, on top of the 253 vows prescribed for bhikṣus.

Thus, in the face of this kind of disparity, whether or not monks watch porn is pretty much a nonissue since Buddhist institutional monasticism systematically oppresses women.

Yes, praising oneself with faint criticism is often a proffered justification of the harsh criticism of others, i.e., "I'm not perfect, but that other person..."

As far as the three vows go, this is an interesting literature, but none of it is decisive nor conclusive. Why? Because no one agrees on how they should be interpreted, for example, the controversy over whether the fifth samaya merely refers to abandoning Mahāyāna bodhicitta, or the release of semen. Tibetan scholars spend lifetimes obsessing about issues which are of no fundamental importance. 

However, if we get the essence of the three vows, rather than being distracted by their particulars, the essence of the Hinayāna vows is not harming others. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography from this point of view should be "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography harm others?"

The essence of Mahāyāna vows is helping sentient beings. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography should be, "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography cause me to objectify women (and men)— treating them as objects of personal gratification— and cause me to  lose sight of them as persons deserving of my compassion?"

The essence of general Secret Mantra vows is pure vision. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography from this point of view should be "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography lead me into engage in impure vision?"

This issue is not housewives in general and the obvious fact that many women today find this a fulfilling, satisfying life. The issue is Manibhadra specifically, and her obvious unhappiness with her state of domestic servitude, her youthful rebellion and her eventual emancipation more than a decade after meeting her guru. 

Indeed, this tale is edifying example for women inso far as Manibhadra shakes free of the shackles of mundane, patriarchal domesticity and realizes her own power as an independent women. Recall that in general the tales of the 84 Mahāsiddhas virtually always contain some element of transgression of conventional norms. A common women shaking free of her domestic role and abandoning her husband and young children would have been nothing short of totally shocking and transgressive to Indians in the 11th century. 

My critique is not directed at liberated men and women, but rather the patriarchal values that overlook, demean, and obscure women (with rare exceptions like the four female Mahāsiddhas, the Therigatha and so on) through the near total silence of women's voices and the obvious male fetishization of women found in Buddhist literature in general, and particularly in the Niruttarayogatantras.

The point of the story is that she is unhappy with family life, and when she breaks the pot she says:

To what home will
beginningless sentient beings go
when the clay vessel of their bodies is broken?
My clay vessel has long been broken, 
Now I shall go to great bliss without returning 
to the house of samsara.
E ma! Those who wish to attain bliss
should rely on the amazing guru!



You also seem to lack the understanding that she rebelled against her parents after receiving the Cakrasamvara empowerment and instructions from Kukkurpa:

The guru saw that the girl's continuum was ripe, and bestowed upon her the empowerment of Cakrasamvara. After she was given the instruction for unifying creation and completion, she practiced in that retreat place for a week. Then she retuned to her parents. 

Since they beat and derided her, the girl said, "If the three realms are pure, are you not my parents? Though your family and lineage are important, you do not turn away from samsara. I have been struck by the accomplishment of liberation based on my guru! I shall follow the path," and left them speechless. 

She then cultivated her guru's instructions and having giving up all activities, she remained for one year. After her husband came and took her to his house, she did all the mundane work and activities, she agreed to comply in body and speech, and spoke pleasantly, and so on.

She continued in this way for 12 years, had a couple of kids, etc., then she has the incident with the pot. So I think that your characterization (while understandable given the way it is presented in the translation you are using) is thoroughly inaccurate. 

If we are going to characterize this story, I think Manibhadra the Domestic Drudge is a more apt analogy than "Happy Housewife."

If you wish to follow rules 1-3, fantastic, more power to you. 

It might be argued from a Buddhist POV that the pornography industry, item 6 on your list, is a species of human trafficking, but personally, I think that would be an over-application of the principle. All actors in the pornography industry must a) prove their age b) sign consent forms in order for that pornography to be considered legal.

I also agree that there is illegal pornography which is a result of human trafficking.

As for 4 and 5, animals and children cannot give consent.

Child pornography is illegal by definition. 

Apart from that, in general, every case brought to the courts has found that laws seeking to outlaw pornography are an attack on the First Amendment.

One hilarious factoid is that Dworkin was instrumental in writing Canada's anti-pornography legislation, under which some of her own works were censored. 

In terms of the Ghantapāda story, the point is that is representative of male-centered tropes which belie the oft touted gender egalitarianism of Vajrayāna. 

Thus far, no gender scholars have emerged who are sufficiently educated about and intimate with the primary and secondary literature of Vajrayāna to make any sustained critique of its systematic sexism and replacement of women's voices with narratives which mainly serve to reinforce human female subordination to male whimsies, while transforming empowered women into dangerous Others in the form of witches (ḍākinīs) and hags (matrikas).

Perhaps I was not clear. I was pointing toward an understanding of pornography itself as violence towards women and children (and perhaps men as well). For example, we do not consider rape a "sex" crime, we understand rape to be a violent crime. 

So the true question before us is what distinguishes erotica (non-violent sexual entertainment conveyed through images and writing) from pornography (violence against women and children perpetrated through images and writing).

Perhaps. All I can tell is you what I have been taught by my teachers, and what Longchenpa and others say about the practice in various manuals. 

The purpose of karmamudra is to take desire into the path. If you have no desire, there is no need to rely on the path of messengers. Furthermore, from a Dzogchen point of view, as stated in the Tantra of the Union of the Sun and Moon, for example, the practice is beneficial only for men.

How about women-made hardcore lesbian porn? 

The reason why women are subject to abuse in the porn industry is because of patriarchal attitudes towards women worldwide, not because depictions of sex acts, even graphic depictions of sexual acts, are intrinsically immoral. 

The problem is not porn, the problem is patriarchy. This also applies to Buddhist tantric statues and thangkha art, where the depictions of women show clear power differentials and patriarchal tropes, since they are forms and symbols largely determined by men. This applies equally to the objectification of women in manuals on how to choose consorts.

Also there will be many siddhas with the ability to ripen and liberate themselves and others, free from obstruction in signs of accomplishments. The lineage of siddhas who have taken dākinīs and dharmapālas as servants will become widely spread just like a cluster of stars. 

But the "strict" discipline of those believed to be siddhas will be guzzling booze. Their qualities will be bad behavior. Their practice will be attachment and aversion. Their experience will be avarice. Their signs of accomplishment will be spawning bastards.The way they benefit migrating beings is seducing groups of young women. Their activities impoverish the land. There will be many such "siddhas" who confidently rely on false craziness.

This piece of sociological speculation is also completely unsubstantiated and is not born out by even a superficial observation of Tibetan society. Ngakpa Dratsangs alway operated within close proximity to large Monastic establishments. The exception to this would be Tibetan Lamas who fled local wars with their families and followers and relocated to hidden lands. When established, they would automatically set about reestablishing Monastic Buddhism, monks and all. Oddly enough, the harshest criticism of so-called village Ngakpas (grong sngags pa) are in predictions of Padmasambhava. 

I could go on, but what's the point?

No, Nāgārjuna states that dependent origination and emptiness are basically the same thing:


That which originates in dependence is explained as emptiness,
that is a dependent designation, that itself is the middle way.

And:

Whoever rejects the emptiness of dependent origination
is one who rejects all mundane conventions. 


And:

Whoever sees dependent origination sees suffering,
the source of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path.

One of the Buddhist criticisms of Advaita is that their presentation of the relative, conventional level is faulty, and therefore, their presentation of the ultimate is consequently faulty.

Yes, the idea that hell beings have no bodies comes from Vasubandhu. When I said you were mixing up Hinayāna and Mahāyāna views, I meant that there is only one section of Mahāyāna that maintains that even conventionally, hells being have no bodies, i.e., cittamatra. 

The element of air is one of the four mahābhūtas, and therefore, a body made from the element of air is indeed part of the rupāskandha and is capable of perceiving physical sense objects, which are also part of the rūpaskandha. It is indeed a subtle body, since it is predominantly made of air, but each of the four elements contains the other three elements.

The so-called mental body in the bardo is in fact made of the matter of the element of air, as Greg mentioned above.

It is a special point of Dzogchen, in fact, that there are no realms which are utterly devoid of matter, including the formless realms. The idea that the formless realm is utterly lacks matter Sarvastivadin idea which is also maintained in Mahāyāna and general Secret Mantra, except Dzogchen.

Yes, one has all five aggregates even in the bardo of dharmātā. When one passes through the bardo of the time of death, one assumes a new series of aggregates.

Dependent origination functions both serially and simultaneously. The way it does so is described in the beginning of chapter 3 of the Abhidharmakośa in much detail. The issue of the bardo is also addressed in chapter three, in relation too dependent origination. 

In the bardo, one has all five aggregates. 

If you read this chapter, you will understand the entire topic with respect to the bardo of rebirth. You will not understand the elaborated concept of the bardo discussed in Dzogchen teachings.

You cannot explain "sweet" to anyone. But when they taste it, they know exactly what you mean by sweet. Buddhahood is something to be shown in one's direct perception. It is a meaning that must be discovered before one can give it a word. It is not something that can be communicated with abstract concepts before it is experienced, despite Nāgārjuna's famous dictum about the necessity of convention for understanding the ultimate, since the two truths are deviations in themselves. There is only one truth and one stage.

Well, there is always Dombhi Heruka's Four Syllables:

Namo Guruve. 
The Intimate Instruction of the Great Bliss of Dharma
There are three essences, four commitments, three deviations and four methods of resting.
The three essences: 
Effortlessness
Without contrivance
Everything that occurs is understood as one's own mind. 
The four commitments: 
Afflictions are not abandoned because they are one's mind. 
Antidotes are not relied upon because the mind is non-dual. 
The true nature is not meditated upon because mind is without grasping.
A result is not hoped for, realizing the mind itself is Buddhahood.
The three deviations: 
If there is hope for Buddhahood, it is a deviation.
If there is fear towards Samsara, it is a deviation.
If there is attachment to appearances, it is a deviation.
The four methods of resting:
Just like the limpid quality of water when it is undisturbed, rest relaxed in uncontrived mind.
Just as a bird in the sky leaves no tracks, consciousness rests without support.
Just like the sun not concealed by clouds, rest in one’s own unobstructed state relaxing into the objects of the six sense organs.
Just like water always falling, rest undistracted at all times and in all activities.

Not at all. Don't confuse Deep Ecology as some sort of ecoasceticism. It is in fact the opposite. It is a celebration of the sensuous. One of the more famous  books in the Deep Ecology is called The Spell of the Sensuous, arguing that this environmental debacle arose in large part because human beings have become alienated from the sensuous. We have cut ourselves off from our biosphere by trapping ourselves in abstractions, and so, having forgotten it in our deepest sense consciousnesses, we destroy it without noticing it anymore.
