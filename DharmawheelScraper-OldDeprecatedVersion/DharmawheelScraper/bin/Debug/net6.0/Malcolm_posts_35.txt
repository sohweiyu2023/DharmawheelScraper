That is not the point of this discussion. The point is in terms of general samayas: what is appropriate for academic scholars to reveal and what is not.

If you take a strict approach, nothing should be discussed. But as I mentioned above, HHDL has already pointed out that is a flawed approach.

This is the traditional Indian way, but much has changed. 

This is largely a show among Tibetans, since you can walk into any Tibetan monastery and see all the Yidams, Mandalas, implements and so on, since Vajrayāna is the state religion of Tibet. 

Then there is the hilarity of the fact that Tibetans keep secret things that have been a normal part of Indian life for generation, things like prāṇāyama, mudras, etc. 

In the end, it is up to you.

For myself, I don't really discuss details of practice or the particulars of what I practice.

He states in the VV that he has no propositions/thesis concerning svabhāva as defined by his opponents. He does not say he has no views at all. For example, he clearly states in the MMK that he prefers the Sammitya view of karma. 

Your claim is similar to the mistaken assertion made by some who claim that Candrakirti never resorts to syllogisms, which in fact he clearly does in the opening lines of the MAV. What Candra disputes is not syllogistic reasoning in its entirety, but rather, syllogistic reasoning applied to emptiness. 

Likewise, he clearly asserts the view in the VV that there is no svabhāva in phenomena. Madhyamaka is not a simple minded "I have no view" proposition.

He is saying precisely that the reality of phenomena is dependent origination and emptiness, depending on which way one is seeing things. 

For example, in the 70 he says:

The nature of all things is empty.
For what reason? The nature of all things
is an assembly of causes and conditions.
or, because there is neither being nor nonbeing
in each and every thing, they are empty 

He is here declaring that the nature or reality (the state of being pertaining to things) of all things is emptiness. 

He says, 

Having realized things are empty,
one will not be confused because of seeing correctly

that is designated in dependence,

I never said reality "had an objective state," nevertheless, reality, since it applies to all phenomena, whatever it may be, can be considered an objective state for the purpose of discussion.

A student once asked my guru, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, if he should do Ngondro before Dzogchen. My teacher's reply to him was that all of his students were Dzogchen practitioners, in essence, his reply was "no." That said, my teacher's ngondro liturgies are beautiful.

Yes, but this does not indicate that these upadeshas were transmitted to people who lacked necessary empowerments and so forth. 

You will recall, the dividing line between Sūtra and Secret Mantra is empowerment. You will also recall that the mahāmudra we are discussing does not even belong to lower tantra (Mahāmudra in lower tantra refers to the commitment to mediate one's body as the body of the deity). 

And as I have repeated already, this sūtra mahāmudra was elaborated for those who did not have the capacity for Vajrayāna, as can be easily verified  by reading Kongtrul's description of sūtra mahāmudra.

Anger is the result, generally, of how we interpret unpleasant sensations. 

We have mind, mental factors, and matter. Two of the skandhas, sensation and perception, are actually mental factors. But they are treated as separate aggregates from the formation aggregate because of their dominant role in keeping us in samsara. 

So emotions are the judgments, the color deriving from the attachments and aversions we have towards what it is we are sensing.

So yes, everything is absolutely equivalent to an illusion. 

A geshe challenged Milarepa to a debate. He said to Milarepa, "You are a great meditator. Tell us, is space conditioned or unconditioned?" 

Milarepa replied, "Why, space is conditioned of course." 

The Geshe really thought he had caught Milarepa in a gross error, and replied, "How is space conditioned like this rock? The rock offers impediment, space offers no impediment."

In reply, Milarepa picked up a stick and began to beat on space, producing the sound of a drum.

Illustrious Kagyus such as Gyalwa Yanggongpa are extremely clear that Gampopa's mahāmudra arose from his own experience and has no precedent in the Indian tradition. It is a certainty for example that Milarepa did not pass on a lineage of Mahāmudra to Gampopa scrubbed of the two stages. 

Other illustrious Kagyus like Kongtrul are equally clear that sūtra mahāmudra for example is a "mahāmudra" for those who lack the capacity to practice Vajrayāna. 

The best you are going to get is that there was a group of Indian masters such as Shri Simha (the Dzogchen master) who taught that the creation stage was not important. One can make an argument perhaps that Maitripa was such a later exponent, but not for Saraha, who was the master who introduced to the Cakrasamvara Tantra to the world.

If by science you simply means an area of knowledge, then I can agree. 

But if by science you mean it can stand along with physics, and so on, I have to disagree. 

Why? Science in the latter sense depends upon empirical validation of the perceptions of many ordinary people over time under controlled experimental conditions, slowly piecing together this and that kind of knowledge. Buddhadharma on the other hand is entirely revelatory, and is based on faith in the perception of extraordinary people whose perceptions cannot be validated by ordinary people. The validation of those perceptions necessitates that one has oneself transformed into an extraordinary person whose knowledge does not depend on the empirical validation of the perceptions of many ordinary people over time under controlled experimental conditions.

First and foremost, rainbow body is the result of what happens when you eradicate for yourself the fundamental delusion that sustains samsaric appearances. Since the outer and inner five elements are already the five lights of pristine consciousness misperceived, when that misperception is utterly removed, where one once perceived the five elements in all their diversity, one now perceives nothing but a field of light.

The fact that our kids are as poorly educated as they are these days is a fault I lay at the doorstep first of lazy parents, but also at the feet of the Republican efforts to slash all public funding.

I guess the basic difference between us is that I strongly believe in public funding of humanities and arts and I think it is a loss that we have decided as a society that humanities and arts have no intrinsic worth. Just look at the all the Buddhist studies programs around the world that are being cut. Denmark, Australia, whose next?

I don't know anything about it. 

What I do know is that kids these days are leaving high school less educated than I did, with more deficits in reading skills, and so on. 

We have slipped from being the best, to being something 29th in the world. The Italians have a better educational system than we do. The top five are all Asian countries, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc. Finland is #6. 

Children are simply not being well educated in our country, over all.

Well, I read both right wing and left wing authors. 

Many people here may not have read Hayek or Nozick. I have, and I respect their point of view. Nozick's libertarianism extended to animals, for example, thus he was a vegetarian. He did not feel we had the right to eat or exploit animals. I've read Spengler, Gentile, Evola, Pound, Celine, etc., many so called "fellow travelers on the right."

I have also read Marx, Engles, etc., and I respect their efforts to free working class people from the boot of 19th century industrial exploitation. I used to have a copy of Rubin's Steal this Book, and when I was ten, I was reading Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, Weather Underground's Prairie Fire, as well as Be Here Now, first edition (where I first discovered Padmasambhava). 

As a pre-teen I also read the Don Juan, Electric Koolaid Acid Test, etc. 

My influences and interests are all over the map.

(4) Property and freedom are inseparably connected; economic leveling is not economic progress.
(5) Power is full of danger; therefore the good state is one in which power is checked and balanced, restricted by sound constitutions and customs.
(6) The past is a great storehouse of wisdom
(7) Modern society urgently needs true community: and true community is a world away from collectivism.
(9) Men and women are not perfectible, conservatives know; and neither are political institutions.

I don't agree with American Exceptionalism, so I left out item 8, and while I certainly think there is a wisdom beyond that of ordinary mortals, I would not characterize it as "Divine."

Given that Republicans generally like enforcing conformity, pass policies that rob people of their properties and interests, try as hard as they can to undermine checks and balances in government, grossly distort the past, encourage corporate collectivism, and insist their political vision is perfect, I have no idea why a conservative would want to be a Republican.

The "I" is the habit of grasping to the idea of self. It can take the form of grasping to something as a self, or, as it really is, merely a mental habit of thinking "I am."

That habit is not a self, does not belong to a self, and has no self, but it continually carries on imputing a self. 

This habit maintains its "individuality" because its causes and conditions are unique to it, just as the causes and conditions that lead from seed to sprout are unique to that series. 

This nonexistent I can be an agent of karma and a recipient of ripening of karma, even though it does not exist as such.

I offer them the same challenge I offered Gesar Mukpo. If they cannot clearly remember their past lives, then what kind of "nirmanakāyas" are they? Khyentse Wangpo was supposed to be a 13th stage Vajradhara. 

If people wish to believe that all these incarnations are really the incarnation of JKW, ok, that is fine with me. I am not particularly convinced of this, as I am not especially convinced the tulku system is a reliable means of selecting emanations or reincarnations, etc.

A buddha's mind has no limitations, a buddha also cannot accumulate karma, suffer in samsara, etc. However, in reality, from a Dzogchen point of view, nirmanakāyas are a result of the delusions of sentient being, as Manjuśrimitra says:

Because the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion.

Therefore, an argument can be made that all these emanations just correspond to our own delusion, nothing more, nothing less.

There is critical thinking and fruitless intellectual proliferation. Sometimes it is hard to discern one from the other. 

In this case, I suspect our friends question, reasonable though it is, arises from a lack of familiarity with the basic assumption of Buddhadharma. Karma is personal and only can worked out and experienced personally. The reason this happens is because mind streams are intrinsically separate and unique and have no ultimate origin.

An effect is supported on its causes and conditions. In order for a mind stream to "split" it would have to, in effect, calve itself, produce two instances of itself simultaneously.

Likewise, for merging, one consciousness would have to give up it own causes and conditions, and adopt those of another. 

The point is that in the end, the Buddha said that we are owners and heirs of our own karma. If a mind stream split, then this would not be the case, the second person of the split mind stream would be an heir of karma they never produced themselves, etc.

Also, if you theorize a split in a mindstream, you are proposing a beginning to a sentient being, something which is impossible given dependent origination and its consequences.

You can follow up by looking at any discussions of his twenty verses. 

In order for a consciousness to split in the manner you suggest, from a Buddhist perspective this is impossible, since it leaves the undesirable consequence that one would then have to explain how karmavipaka (result of karma) from one karma would ripen on two distinct and separate conscious entities and so on.

A moment of consciousness is not made of parts, as I said before. In order for a moment of consciousness to be split, it would have to be something composed of parts, as I said before. 

For example, a single seed will produce only a single sprout, irrespective of the other causes and conditions that support that sprout, so it is with the next moment of your consciousness. This moment will produce only a single subsequent moment of consciousness.

There is no dignity in samsara. What is samsara? Samsara is the three kinds of suffering. 

What are the three kinds of suffering? The suffering of suffering, the suffering of change and the all-pervasive suffering. 

There is no dignity in suffering, there is no dignity in ignorance. Ignorance is the cause of samsara and the cause of suffering. 

As Maitreya states, there isn't even the head of a pin of happiness in samsara. What room could there be for dignity?

Who said there was no place for provisional teachings? 

But in general, what kind of dignity can be found in the three kinds of suffering. The nobility or dignity of suffering is an entirely Christian idea. I don't see that it has much place in Buddhadharma. For example, apart from Trungpa's scene, where they waffle on a lot about "dignity," I don't see any references to "dignity" with respect to samsara the sūtras and tantras.

You can say that. 

However, the point is that the Buddha's path is not only about freedom from negative qualities. It is also about the attainment of positive qualities, such as the four fearlessness, the eighteen unshared qualities of a Buddha and so on. 

So while it is true that the motive for the attainment of these positive qualities is in order to liberate other sentient beings, they are also positive in their own right, apart from that motivation. 

The negative view of awakening that you consistently portray also shortens one's lifespan.

While there are of course, inner and secret presentations of "where" Zangdog Palri is, the late master, Lodö Gyatsho (1930—2002) states:

In the past eon, when Hayagriva and Vajravārāhī liberated Rudra, among the eight substances blessed as the eight places which are sources of Secret Mantra, if it is asked which substance, the place where his sexual organ fell is a special place for the dependent origination of the unsurpassed secret. Further, the shape of the island resembles a scapula with the short edge facing north. It is maroon in color, as if it were copper in all directions. All of the mountains stand up like weapons. There are very deep ravines, and all the trees bear thorns. All the rivers are disturbed by waves, during the day the whole place has wind storms, and at night blazes with fire.


It then goes on the describe how it is surrounded by eight islands, each with one of the eight manifestations of Padmasambhava giving teachings, and so on.

Title: Re: Is the nature of mind a fiction?

It depends on which system we are discussing, Mahāmudra or Dzogchen. 

In general, in Chan we do not find any descriptions of the mind essence one would not also find in the sūtras, such attributes as luminosity, etc., are all tp be found in the sūtra division. Also, there is the notion that buddhahood is to be found in the mind. 

Mahāmudra, and here we are referring to Mahāmudra as it is practiced mainly the Karma Kagyu school, is divided up into three kinds, sūtra, "tantric" and essence. The first of these is based on a gradual system of pointing out done in conjunction with sessions of practice. The second of these is based on the experience of empowerment combined with yogic practices which rapidly induce samadhi, and the third of these systems is based on a kind of blessing empowerment and does not have any practice other than guru devotion. Of these three, the first is most like Chan, in that while it is gradual, it is also includes the idea of sudden awakening. In all, the practice is based on understand that mind as inseparable clarity and emptiness as the basis for the three kāyas. Clarity and luminosity are not the same thing (though the term gsal ba, clarity, can be used as a gloss for 'od gsal, luminosity"), the former term refers to mind's open lit-up space in which appearances rise and subside —&nbsp;some people like to translate clarity as "cognizance." In sūtra and Chan "luminosity" refers to the mind's essential purity. 

In Dzogchen on the other hand, mind is strictly a product of a process of delusion. While the mind-essence is also inseparable clarity and emptiness, mind itself is the result of ignorance about its own state. Thus mind is always with concepts and is always deluded, mind-essence is always nonconceptual and undeluded. 

The reason why the awakening of all three systems is the same is that all realize the same emptiness. But there are distinct differences in path and praxis based on how the mind-essence is understood and how the human body plays a role in awakening (Note, I did not say that buddhahood offered by all three systems is the same, just the awakening (there is one level of Buddhahood in Chan, three in Mahāmudra and six in Dzogchen.) In Chan, apart from posture, there is basically no role for the human body in terms of awakening. This also true in Sūtra Mahāmudra, where the practice based on a gradual approach to śamatha and vipaśyāna, combined with oral instructions from the siddhas. 

In Dzogchen, the practice is based on the human body from beginning to end, like other Vajrayāna systems. While there are many differences between Dzogchen and other Vajrayāna systems, one of the most salient is Dzogchen is not a path of renunciation, nor is it a path of transformation. It is a path of self-liberation. How that self-liberation is understood is a direct consequence of how it deals with the issue of mind essence.

These things in general come from Taoism. In the end, they are based on a view of the human body somewhat outside the view of the Human body as it is understood in the Tantras. There are other importamt differences as well that you would really have to study Secret Mantra in a serious way to properly understand.

It would be an error to state that awakening in Chan and Dzogchen and Mahamudra were different, for they are not. But the path of Chan, Mahamudra, and Dzogchen are very diffirent, and it is a grave error to conflate them.

Chan is Sūtra because it is not Vajrayāna, plain and simple. It has no method of empowerment, no method of direct introduction, no practice based on the anatomy of the human body, etc. 

There are no methods in Chan not taught in sūtras. Chan is basically prajñāpāramitā in theory and approach, using the sudden approach taught in the Lankāvatara Sūtra. This is why I call Chan sūtra-based, not because there is some sūtra that Chan follows.

But its ok, you asked a question, I endeavored to answer it. It is pretty clear to me when I talk to Zen folks that their practice is very different than what we do. I also have a student who practiced for 35 years under Maizumi Roshi and his successors. She is pretty clear on how Zen, including koans, and Dzogchen, etc. are different.

Again, the difference is that in direct introduction you are introduced to the mind-essence immediately, it is not something you need to go out and discover on your own or search for. 

In Chan, there is no discussion of direct introduction, or even hint of it, because Chan is a path which is not based on Secret Mantra. So the approach is completely different.

No one said they leaped: the last hell being out of hell take rebirth in the preta realm; the last preta takes rebirth in the animal realm, and so on. This all takes an extraordinary amount of time from our limited 100 year (if we are lucky) perspective.

The reason why the upper form realms do not perish, as near as I can make out, it because they are the location of the pure abodes such as the Akaniṣṭha (not the same as Akaniṣṭha Ganavyuha) , āryas inhabit them. Relevant pages in the Kośabhasyaṃ vol.2, 475-477. 

And yes, if we are indolent and like to suffering for a really long time, sure, we do not have to do anything much, and eventually we will be born in the upper form realm, hear teachings, attain liberation, and that will be that. Or we can save ourselves the trouble, hear teachings now, put them into practice and at worst achieve buddhahood in the bardo.

Mainly 1) because the native language of Madagascar is the only language in the world related to the language of the Borneo headhunters and 2) Buddhaguptanatha, Taranatha's Indian teacher, reported that he received Padmasambhava's transmissions of Hevajra and so on on that Island in the 16th century, back when it was named San Lorenzo in Portuguese. 3) Meru cosmology is an Indo-centric view of the world, and it does in fact refer to real places on our planet, such as Uttarakuru, which is also the same region as the one called "Kuru" by Ptolemy, inhabited by horse riding nomads, etc. 

We can understand from the account of the taming of Rudra, the Ramayāna and so on, that Indian shipping lanes were troubled by seagoing pirates related to the headhunters of Borneo, and in the case of Śrī Lanka, there was an out and out war between Indo-Aryans and the headhunting tribes living there.

No, it does not work like that at all. 

You seem to have forgotten that each of the six realms vanishes when it is emptied of sentient beings, beginning with the hell realms. This is common also to Abhidharma. However, the two upper form realms never disappear, even though everything below them is destroyed by cataclysms of fire, air and water at the end of the eon. The main difference between this cosmological idea in Abhidharma and Dzogchen is that in the latter, it is held by Garab Dorje that all sentient beings attain buddhahood through the practice of Atiyoga. So here, the idea that there is no one devoid of the gotra, family of buddhahood.

In fact, there is no place where Vasubandhu makes this identification. 

This is a later tradition, post-Vasubandhu, making its first appearance in the works of Xuantsang, and in fact the Chinese tradition itself is all over the map. By the eight century however, the tradition is solidified in India (nearly five centuries after the dates generally assumed for the composition of the five treatises, i.e. late 3rd, early 4th century), and thus the Tibetan sources are univocal on this point. 

The fact that Mipham reports a tradition that is demonstrably late and has no foundation in the core texts we are discussing themselves is of no weight whatsoever. 

The fact is that no Madhyamaka authors until the Haribhadra make this identification, especially in light of Vimuktisena making no mention of it, and the fact that Vasubandhu's main student, Sthiramati, makes no mention of it either. The latter merely refers to Maitreya as "Ārya Maitreya," and while he indicates that the author of the Madhyantavibhanga is impeded by only a single birth, he offers no details on the transmission of the text to Asanga apart from noting that it was bestowed upon Asanga through the blessings of Maitreya. 

As we move through the texts in time, we can see the story becoming more elaborated and fleshed out.

No, my friend, you are incorrect. The very fact that she engages with Maudgalyāna in why she has not changed her gender indicates this is all three: view, path and result.

This entire sūtra is very interesting, in so far as Vimaladatta takes on all the Buddha's major arhat disciples and defeats them in debate over the question of gender, one by one.

Then of course there is the Nirvana Sūtra which says very clearly, "Here in Jamudvipa I exhibit buddhahood in the body of a woman."

The Ārya-vimaladattaparipṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra depicts a conversation between the eighth stage female bodhisattva Ārya Vimaladatta and Maudgalyāna. He asked her why she has not changed her gender. She replies, "Why haven't you changed yours since you are the master of miraculous power," and than says:

Venerable Mahā Maudgalyāna, the body of a woman cannot attain the awakening of manifest perfect buddhahood. The body of a man cannot attain the awakening of manifest perfect buddhahood. Why? Because awakening does not arise, therefore, the body and mind are incapable of manifest perfect buddhahood

There are no thoughts to create a partition if there is no mind. 

And, since, as you say, when you discover your own state, you also discover the state of the "universe" (i.e. gcig shes kun grol), this reduces the so called "basis" to a set of generic qualities. This does not render a mind "self-existent."

For example, Āryadeva says that when you discover the emptiness of one thing, you discover the emptiness of all things. But this does not mean there is an emptiness "out there" which pervades everything, anymore than there is a basis "out there" which is the foundation for manifestation.

I did not say anything of the kind anywhere. I never made such a claim and neither do Dzogchen texts.

You seem to think there is some kind of basis, which you imagine to be transcendent (aka free from extremes), out of which there arises an appearance (how and to whom?); despite the obvious contradiction in such a position if your putative basis is just blank emptiness free from extremes (i.e. something which does not exist at all, conventionally or otherwise).

When the Dzogchen texts are talking about "the basis" in terms of essence, nature and compassion, they are talking about qualities of the nature of the mind, not some transcendent pleroma.

Take it up with the Goddess of the Ganges, I suspect she has a thing or two to say about this:


Thereupon, a certain goddess who lived in that house, having heard this teaching of the Dharma of the great heroic bodhisattvas, and being delighted, pleased, and overjoyed, manifested herself in a material body and showered the great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas, and the great disciples with heavenly flowers. When the flowers fell on the bodies of the bodhisattvas, they fell off on the floor, but when they fell on the bodies of the great disciples, they stuck to them and did not fall. The great disciples shook the flowers and even tried to use their magical powers, but still the flowers would not shake off. Then, the goddess said to the venerable Sariputra, "Reverend Sariputra, why do you shake these flowers?"

Sariputra replied, "Goddess, these flowers are not proper for religious persons and so we are trying to shake them off."

The goddess said, "Do not say that, reverend Sariputra. Why? These flowers are proper indeed! Why? Such flowers have neither constructual thought nor discrimination. But the elder Sariputra has both constructual thought and discrimination.

"Reverend Sariputra, impropriety for one who has renounced the world for the discipline of the rightly taught Dharma consists of constructual thought and discrimination, yet the elders are full of such thoughts. One who is without such thoughts is always proper.

"Reverend Sariputra, see how these flowers do not stick to the bodies of these great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas! This is because they have eliminated constructual thoughts and discriminations.

"For example, evil spirits have power over fearful men but cannot disturb the fearless. Likewise, those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures, which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the passions inherent in the constructive world. Thus, these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated their instincts for the passions and do not stick to the bodies of those who have eliminated their instincts. Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the bodies of these bodhisattvas, who have abandoned all instincts."

Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how long have you been in this house?"

The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been in liberation."

Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some time?"

The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some time?"

At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.

The goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why do you not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the question."

Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what to say.

Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of liberation. Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can it be apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are neither internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else. Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality of all things!

Sariputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire, hatred, and folly?

Goddess: "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly" that is the teaching of the excessively proud. But those free of pride are taught that the very nature of desire, hatred, and folly is itself liberation.

Sariputra: Excellent! Excellent, goddess! Pray, what have you attained, what have you realized, that you have such eloquence?

Goddess: I have attained nothing, reverend Sariputra. I have no realization. Therefore I have such eloquence. Whoever thinks, "I have attained! I have realized!" is overly proud in the discipline of the well-taught Dharma.

Sariputra: Goddess, do you belong to the disciple-vehicle, to the solitary-vehicle, or to the great vehicle?

Goddess: I belong to the disciple-vehicle when I teach it to those who need it. I belong to the solitary-vehicle when I teach the twelve links of dependent origination to those who need them. And, since I never abandon the great compassion, I belong to the great vehicle, as all need that teaching to attain ultimate liberation.

Nevertheless, reverend Sariputra, just as one cannot smell the castor plant in a magnolia wood, but only the magnolia flowers, so, reverend Sariputra, living in this house, which is redolent with the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, one does not smell the perfume of the disciples and the solitary sages. Reverend Sariputra, the Sakras, the Brahmas, the Lokapalas, the devas, nagas, yaksas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, and mahoragas who live in this house hear the Dharma from the mouth of this holy man and, enticed by the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, proceed to conceive the spirit of enlightenment.

Reverend Sariputra, I have been in this house for twelve years, and I have heard no discourses concerning the disciples and solitary sages but have heard only those concerning the great love, the great compassion, and the inconceivable qualities of the Buddha.

Reverend Sariputra, eight strange and wonderful things manifest themselves constantly in this house. What are these eight?

A light of golden hue shines here constantly, so bright that it is hard to distinguish day and night; and neither the moon nor the sun shines here distinctly. That is the first wonder of this house.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, whoever enters this house is no longer troubled by his passions from the moment he is within. That is the second strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house is never forsaken by Sakra, Brahma, the Lokapalas, and the bodhisattvas from all the other buddha-fields. That is the third strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house is never empty of the sounds of the Dharma, the discourse on the six transcendences, and the discourses of the irreversible wheel of the Dharma. That is the fourth strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, in this house one always hears the rhythms, songs, and music of gods and men, and from this music constantly resounds the sound of the infinite Dharma of the Buddha. That is the fifth strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, in this house there are always four inexhaustible treasures, replete with all kinds of jewels, which never decrease, although all the poor and wretched may partake to their satisfaction. That is the sixth strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, at the wish of this good man, to this house come the innumerable Tathagatas of the ten directions, such as the Tathagatas Sakyamuni, Amitabha, Aksobhya, Ratnasri, Ratnarcis, Ratnacandra, Ratnavyuha, Dusprasaha, Sarvarthasiddha, Ratnabahula, Simhakirti, Simhasvara, and so forth; and when they come they teach the door of Dharma called the "Secrets of the Tathagatas" and then depart. That is the seventh strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, all the splendors of the abodes of the gods and all the splendors of the fields of the Buddhas shine forth in this house. That is the eighth strange and wonderful thing.

Reverend Sariputra, these eight strange and wonderful things are seen in this house. Who then, seeing such inconceivable things, would believe the teaching of the disciples?

Sariputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?

Goddess: Although I have sought my "female state" for these twelve years, I have not yet found it. Reverend Sariputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, "What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"

Sariputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?

Goddess: Just so, reverend Sariputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think, "What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?"

Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Sariputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, transformed into Sariputra, said to Sariputra, transformed into a goddess, "Reverend Sariputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"

And Sariputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, "I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!"

The goddess continued, "If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way

as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, 'In all things, there is neither male nor female.'"

Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to his ordinary form. She then said to him, "Reverend Sariputra, what have you done with your female form?"

Sariputra: I neither made it nor did I change it.

Goddess: Just so, all things are neither made nor changed, and that they are not made and not changed, that is the teaching of the Buddha.

Sariputra: Goddess, where will you be born when you transmigrate after death?

Goddess: I will be born where all the magical incarnations of the Tathagata are born.

Sariputra: But the emanated incarnations of the Tathagata do not transmigrate nor are they born.

Goddess: All things and living beings are just the same; they do not transmigrate nor are they born!

Sariputra: Goddess, how soon will you attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood?

Goddess: At such time as you, elder, become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual, then will I attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood.

Sariputra: Goddess, it is impossible that I should become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual.

Goddess: Just so, reverend Sariputra, it is impossible that I should attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood! Why? Because perfect enlightenment stands upon the impossible. Because it is impossible, no one attains the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood.

Sariputra: But the Tathagata has declared: "The Tathagatas, who are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, have attained perfect Buddhahood, are attaining perfect Buddhahood, and will go on attaining perfect Buddhahood."

Goddess: Reverend Sariputra, the expression, "the Buddhas of the past, present and future," is a conventional expression made up of a certain number of syllables. The Buddhas are neither past, nor present, nor future. Their enlightenment transcends the three times! But tell me, elder, have you attained sainthood?

Sariputra: It is attained, because there is no attainment.

Goddess: Just so, there is perfect enlightenment because there is no attainment of perfect enlightenment.

We do not say the basis only has an conscious aspect, it also has an emptiness aspect. That is one of the qualities of the basis. 

By pointing that the basis is a generic set of qualities, Dzogchen is stating that the basis is one's own consciousness, out of which one's afflictive reality is constructed by ignorance (ma rig pa), and deconstructed by knowledge (rig pa).

If you claim, as you are doing, that the basis is some kind of ineffable ground of being, this is contradicts not only the teaching of Dzogchen, but the teaching of the Buddha in toto. (and yes, peanut gallery, I am aware that there are some translators of Dzogchen texts who have taken the ill-advised route of importing terms from Christian theology into their translations, endlessly confusing students who read such texts and leading them far away from the teachings of Dzogchen in the process).

That is fine with me, but do not describe your theories as "Dzogchen," since they have nothing to do with Dzogchen at all, and have more in common with Christian Theology and so on

No, it is related to the imputing ignorance (kun rtags ma rig pa). The Ignorance of the same identity simply means that one's consciousness is unaware of itself. The connate ignorance arises the moment there is movement in that consciousness, which manifest as "colors." If that movement is recognizes as one's own state, then one becomes Samantabhadra. If not, then one moves into the third ignorance, the connate ignorance. 

Zhang Zhung snyan rgyud and some Buddhist schemes, such as the dgongs pa zang thal, do not mention the ignorance of the same identity.

Right, I completely disagree with this. This is not how these things are explained in Dzogchen exegesis, nor how they are to be understood. 

The nidāna or gleng gzhi is a major topic of importance in understanding Dzogchen tantras.

As Shenphen Ozer writes in the beginning of the commentary on this text:

In that respect, not saying "[Thus have I] heard [at one time]" is a superiority over the common vehicles in which the teacher and the retinue appear as separate. Here, the powerful scholar vidyādharas of the past have said this [Thus did I explain at one time] is a phrase which shows the teacher and retinue to be inseparable.

There is even a citation from the Kun byed rgyal po itself which contradicts your assertion:

I have always been Kulyarāja. 
Having made the teacher, the teaching, the retinue and the time, 
the teacher of the teachers is also made by me. 
The teaching is the explanation of my nature. 
After the retinue is the arising of my essence,
the time and place are my nature.
That tantra is the Kulayarāja which explains my nature, 
aside from which there is not even a single Dharma that is explained which is not mine. 

Vimalamitra expands upon this further:

The perfection of place is dharmatā free from proliferation, not established through any characteristic and not established within the experiential range of words and syllables. Since the teacher (the mode of the existence of things) does not exist even as a word upon which proliferation is based, he is not established in terms of faces and hands because he is not established as a nominal proliferation. The perfect retinue for such a teacher is the self-originated [rang byung], self-arisen [rang shar] display of dharmatā. The perfect teaching for such a retinue is one’s own vidyā, the ultimate teaching — though it originates, it is self-originated; though it arises, it is self-arisen without being created by any cause or condition; and it is free from arising and perishing. Though it is present pervading all, its characteristic cannot be understood by anyone. As such, since place, teacher, retinue and the Dharma to be explained meet in the natural reality of things, the perfect time is called “without beginning or end.”

The setting for this tantra is beyond time, and both the teacher and retinue are also beyond time.

The simpler way to put it is that one cannot attain rainbow body by working with karmically solidified vision which arises from traces. One needs to work with so called "appearances of primordial wisdom (pristine consciousness)." 

All appearances initially arise from the (unrecognized) potentiality (rtsal) of compassion (thugs rjes) because this corresponds with what ordinary sentient beings are able to see (i.e., the nirmanakāya), and this is why thugs rje corresponds with the nirmanakāya.

In other words, we are only able to perceive a portion of the basis, with which we are not integrated due to our ignorance. The path allows us to remove that ignorance.

Not in any clear cut and systematic manner. For example, the four samadhis are not systematically explained. The term samadhi is mentioned exactly eight times in the whole text. 

And the term sgom, which is mentioned around 32 times means not just meditation, but a whole range of "cultivations", since that really what the term means. 

The classic take on sems sde is that it primarily concerns the view. I am pretty happy with that. 

If your goal is rainbow body, klong sde and man ngag sde are the ticket. If you want rainbow body, practice according to the sgra thal gyur, the root tantra of Dzogchen in general.

You keep forgetting one thing. Ignorance, ma rig pa. 

The reason why the basis is called "the basis" is because we did not realize it because we are under the influence of ignorance. 

So while it may be the case from the point of reality that our five elements are actually the nature of the light of pristine consciousness or "wisdom," we do not see that because, as you yourself put it, we have not manifested that. The practice for manifesting that is the path, and when our body, etc., finally reverts into pristine consciousness, its real nature, this is called the "result."

That is the point, florin, the Kun byed rgyal po does not actually contain instructions about the path of realizing rainbow body. That is what man ngag sde is for, i.e., how to manifest the result which we have not realized (the basis a.k.a "primordial state"). 

For example, the commentary on the kun byed rgyal po contains myriad citations from the man ngag sde tantras in order to flesh out the meaning which is not explicitly discussed in the kun byed rgyal po itself. However, when one has received instructions on man ngag sde, then it is relative easy to to see how various things stated in the kun byed rgyal po imply thögal. 

But there is no way that one can attain the complete result of Dzogchen teachings based on sems sde alone. If you don't believe me, read Longchenpa. And if you don't believe him, let me remind you that according to ChNN, there is no Tibetan who is more authoritative on explaining the meaning of Dzogchen that Longchenpa.

What I mean is this: people hear a facet of Dzogchen teachings, and assume, "Oh, this is the real Dzogchen teaching, the rest are..." This kind of attitude comes from not studying. For example, some people will say, "Dzogchen is the highest yāna, but it must be approached gradually, after practicing ngondro, three roots, etc." Other people will say, "In Dzogchen we do not need to do anything, fix anything, contrive anything, because everything is perfect just as it is."

The great mistake people make is trying to parse Dzogchen to fit their limited views. 

Dzogchen is a vast body of teachings, and there is no such thing as "pure" Dzogchen. Dzogchen, in its essence, is a part of Secret Mantra and exists with in that context. 

Sems sde, within the Dzogchen literature itself, is mainly treated as the completion stage of mahāyoga, and in fact is really more or less the same thing as trekchö.

And the three words themselves are from the sgra thal gyur, originally.

Basically, there is this idea that the five bodhicitta texts translated by Vairocana, the four lungs and Mañjuśrīmitra's Meditation of Bodhicitta, somehow represent the real authentic or original Dzogchen. Well if they do, everybody grab a māla:

Further, because the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable, and after binding three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

Because most of us are not realizing the meaning of Dzogchen with the so-called direct method, so indirect methods are called for. Similar encouragements to use tantric methods can be found in the Dorsem Namkhaiche, which are supposedly the first words that Garab Dorje taught.

The bodhicitta texts concern the basis and direct introduction, but they lack any method to attain rainbow body. 

It is a given in Dzogchen that our basis or primordial state is essence, nature and compassion. The actual state of the five elements, for example, is the five pristine consciousness, and this is why rainbow body is possible. But we do not manifest rainbow body in the present because of our ignorance, the trio of ignorances which we are subject to after we did not recognize the display of the basis as our own state, once upon a time. 

There is not a single idea in the bodhicitta texts such as Kun byed rgyal po and so on that is not present in the man ngag sde. Actually, the reverse is the case. There are many things in man ngag sde which you will never find in the bodhicitta texts.

This story is included in the Tibetan version, and it is not framed as a vision generated by the nāgā princess. In the Tibetan translation, she transforms herself into a boy, etc. Generally, Tibetan translations are much more faithful to the Indian text. 

In any case, the Goddess of the Ganges episode with in the Vimalakirti Nirdesha Sutra is a much better example of the lack of importance of the role of gender in terms of ultimate awakening.

The experience of clarity can be used a vehicle for transmission, just as can an experience of nonconceptuality or bliss. Since there are three realms, they are each dominated by one of three major experiences, when not recognized for what they are. Attachment to bliss causes rebirth in the desire realm; attachment to clarity causes rebirth in the form realm; attachment to nonconceptuality causes rebirth in the formless realm.

The sanskrit term underlying gsal ba is vivṛta (and a few other terms that mean the same thing). For example, in one commentary on Hevajra, we find གསལ་བ་ནི་མངོན་པའོ, i.e., "clear" means "evident." A long commentary on Abhidharma states,"Clear means fully knowing, but unclear means it is not clear."

Your mind is empty, because it cannot be established, but it is "clear" because it is distinct.

When infinite obstacles arise for those who are properly practicing the sublime Dharma, the sole method for removing them is to supplicate the guru. An instruction better than that has never been taught, is not taught and will never be taught by all the buddhas of the three times. When all obstacles are removed, because of that, siddhi is attained. Based upon that, also all paths are traversed.

Mahāsiddha Virupa chimes in:


All sentient beings are emanations of mahāmudra,
the essence of those emanations is the forever non-arising dharmadhātu,
also all characteristics of dualistic appearances, happiness, suffering and so on,
are the play of mahāmudrā, the original dharmatā.

Because there is no truth and nothing on which to rely in play itself,
reality never transcends the seal of emptiness.

Some are completely tortured with empowerment rites,
some always count their rosary saying hūm phaṭ,
some consume shit, piss, blood, semen and meat,
some meditate the yoga of channels and winds, but all are deluded.

And:

That great profound term “mahāmudrā”, 
whatever it’s basis of designation is, also has the label “empty”;
as moments are empty by nature who realizes selflessness?
There is no realizer, just a name, a term, a label,
Also that is not perfect, a projection of disciples, 
also in disciples there is no self, similar with illusions and emanations,
“Mahāmudrā” is a mental imputation of the childish. 

“Delusion” and “non-delusion” are mere names, mere labels,
who is the person to feel or be aware of delusion?

If not even an iota of the result, nirvana, exists, and is not perceived,
“liberation and non-liberation” is an adventitious reification,
Nothing exists in peaceful and pure space, so what is the path of liberation?

“Ultimate and relative” are also just emphatic labels,
but the two truths don’t exist in the dharmadhātu, the dharmadhātu does not exist. 


Mahāsiddha Kotalipa also adds his voice:

Inanimate and animate phenomena
abide as appearances because there is no duality;
they are naturally pure,
peace, space, and immaculate.

Nonduality is a merely a name,
even that name will not exist;
sensation and one who senses are free from signs,
nonduality is great bliss.

Liberated from all concepts,
without the dualism of duality, supreme peace,
like space, liberated from conceptuality,
that is called nondual, 

the meditation on the appearances of all phenomena
with the yoga of abiding in the inconceivable.

And:

whether I become a Buddha
or not and go to hell,
hell itself blissful.

These "facts" as not my point of view, these "facts" are facts known to the world at large. Try explaining to Joe the Plumber that his truck is merely his imputation and enjoy the blank uncomprehending stare you will receive in return. 

What I find so strange is why a so called "prasangika" spends so much time on a species of mind-only theory. A proper Prasangika just accepts at face value what the world accepts. Certainly Candrakirtī never makes the distinction you are trying to make, and never would assert that direct perceptions are a result of imputations. For example, he states in his commentary to the MAV:

The wisdom that knows all aspects
is asserted to have the characteristic of a direct perception.


And in the Prasannapāda, he clearly accepts the conventions around direct perceptions and inferences.

We saw already that essence, nature and compassion are aspects of what is termed "pristine consciousness" aka ye shes or primordial wisdom.

Dante, the term "basis" describes a state of nonrealization, nothing more. 

We use the term to describe a set of qualities of what is termed "pristine consciousness." The basis is a consciousness, term "pristine consciousness, as the Six Dimensions states:

Because pristine consciousness has three aspects, 
the basis is explained in different words.

The Sgra thal gyur states:

The pristine consciousness dwelling in its own essence
is inseparable in three modalities. 

Further, the Illuminating Lamp commentary on Sgra thal gyur states

the pristine consciousness—subsumed by the consciousness which apprehends primordial liberation and the abiding basis as ultimate—is inseparable in all buddhas and sentient beings as a mere consciousness. 

A rock in a garden is just a projection of a mind that does not recognize its own state. This is very explicitly stated of inanimate objects — they are reified out of the five lights from our nonrecognition of the five lights. For example, the Illuminating Lamp states:

The luminous aspect of delusion resulting from that is stirred by a subtle vāyu. Also, all the previous lights are stirred and obscured, such that the light’s own appearance grows dimmer and dimmer. After it becomes impure, the latent appearances of earth, water, fire, and air emerge and appear as subtle particles.

Etc.

I never said the universe didn't exist. I did not insist that basis inheres anywhere. I said the basis is a set of generic qualities of a given consciousness, the realization of which results in Buddhahood. It is really not hard to understand and is all perfectly consistent with Dzogchen texts and teachings. Shabkar writes:

Fortunate children of good families, listen without distraction:
although the discourses of the eighty-four thousand aggregates of Dharma and so on,
taught by all the victors of the three times,
are equal with space and immeasurable,
in reality, they were taught in order to realize one’s own mind;
apart from this, nothing else was taught by the victors.


And:

All perceived appearances are the appearances of one’s mind.
The outer world that appears to be inert is the mind.
The sentient beings inhabiting it appearing in six classes are also the mind.
The appearance of the happiness of the higher realms of gods and men is the mind.
The appearance of the suffering of the three lower realms is also the mind.
Avidyā appearing as the five poisons is also the mind.
Vidyā appearing as self-originated pristine consciousness is also the mind. [106]
Negative thoughts appearing as the traces of samsara are also the mind.
Positive thoughts appearing as buddhafields are also the mind.
The appearance of obstacles of ghosts and demons is also the mind.
The appearances of gods and siddhis are also the mind.
The appearances of the variety of concepts are also the mind.
Non-conceptuality, appearing as one-pointed meditation, is also the mind.
The signs and colors of things are also the mind.
The absence of signs and non-existence of proliferation is also the mind.
Appearances without the duality of being one or many is also the mind.
Appearances that are not established as being either existent or non-existent are also the mind.
There are no appearances at all apart from the mind. 


And:

This relaxed unfabricated ordinary mind
is the vast space of the realization of the Jinas free from extremes.

Frankly, my friend, I think you are a little too hung up on words.

The universe does not exist outside the minds that project it, and there is no inseparable clarity and emptiness for us to discover apart from the inseparable clarity and emptiness of our own minds. The fact that we can discover the knowledge of our own state through the three experiences proves that we are discovering the knowledge of the real state of our own minds, and nothing else. As far as the reality of the universe goes, well as Āryadeva put it, when one discovers the emptiness of one thing, one discovers the emptiness of all things, and as the Dzogchen tantras put it, knowing one thing liberates everything (gcig shes kun grol).

You should should also bear in mind that the experience of clarity, which is connected with lhun grub, is just an example, the same goes with the experience of emptiness, it is merely an example. This is why, for example, we don't attain the first bhumi at direct introduction (99.999 percent of us at any rate) ——&nbsp;that only happens if one happens to be diligent enough to reach the third vision in this life.

No, the system of Lorigs (blo rigs) used in Gelugpa was invented by a Tibetan scholar named Phya pa at Sangphu in the 12th century. He was one of Loppon Sonam Tsemo's academic professors. Sakya Pandita refutes Phya pa's system utterly in the chapter on blo in his tshad ma rigs gter. Since Sapan's rigs gter has not been published yet in English, very few people are aware of this. Once it is published, it will cause a stir, because thousands of people will realize that the blo rigs they have been taught be Gelug is just Tibetan fabrication, and does not represent the intention of Dharmakīrti.

so what you are saying is that when someone perceives emptiness and enters the first buhmi, they are not perceiving emptiness, just non-conceptuality?[/quote]

What I am saying is that the the term "experience of emptiness" refers to an experience of nonconceptuality, where one's mind seems empty of thoughts and concepts (actually there is still a very subtle stream of thoughts and concepts). It is not the same thing as realizing emptiness, a point which ChNN (since he seems to be the only authority you accept) has made repeatedly over the years. 

Likewise, "the experience of clarity," as opposed to the clarity aspect of the nature of mind, refers to a heightened sense of awareness, where, as ChNN notes, Longchenpa describes being aware of things even though they are outside of his immediate audiovisual range, such as features of the mountains behind him and so on. 

The experience of bliss, obviously, does not refer to the bliss of awakening, but rather pleasurable sensations, for example, during sexual intercourse.

As to your first question, these are indeed karmic appearances. 

As to your second question, a buddha perceives only a display of pristine consciousness, so pristine consciousness or primordial wisdom is what is "actually" there once the delusion ceases. 

This is old argument in Tibetan circles. What Tsongkhapa actually argues is that the posited liquid substance  is validly divisible into six portions: molten iron, pus and blood, water as an environment, water as water, and water as nectar over which asuras and devas squabble, thus rendering all perception conventionally valid, not only in their own domain, but generally so.

No, not multiple bases, no more than there are multiple heats. 

The basis, as we saw above, is just the dharmatā of one's own mind, just as heat is the dharmatā of fire. We don't say of emptiness for example, that there multiple emptinesses for multiple entities, we don't need to say that of the basis either when we understand that the basis is a generic set of attributes for all minds, just as emptiness is a generic attribute of phenomena. We speak of emptiness often without distinguishing whether we mean one emptiness or many emptinesses, because it is understood at the outset that there is no entity "emptiness" that needs to spoken of in plural or singular terms. Likewise, we don't need to speak about the basis in plural or singular terms because we can understand at the outset the term "basis" refers to the dharmatā of the mind, and not some entity out of which minds arise, or in which they are somehow located. Likewise, we discuss fire in terms of heat, we don't say that fires have heats, we merely generically declare that all fires are hot.

I never said that each individual consciousness was ultimate per se. The point is that the ultimate (inseparable luminosity and emptiness) is a generic attribute they all share, in the same way all fires share the generic attribute of heat, and so on, or that each and every entity is empty. As Candra points, all things have two natures, one relative, one ultimate. In Madhyamaka, the ultimate nature of each and everything is emptiness. This is true also in Dzogchen; but in Dzogchen, not only are all minds ultimately empty, they are also ultimately luminous. This inseparable luminosity and emptiness is given the name "one's unfabricated mind" by Vimalamitra, or as Mipham puts it:

That basis is originally pure from the aspect of lacking any proliferation, and since it is not solely empty like space, its impartial clarity is naturally perfect without being delimited or falling into extremes. Since it is the source of the appearances of all samsara and nirvana, compassion is said to pervade everything. In the Dharma terminology of the Great Perfection, the pristine consciousness that is said to be three-fold. 

Likewise, in the sūtras and tantras,  it called “the dhātu” and “emptiness” from the aspect of the characteristic freedom from all kinds of proliferation that cannot be perceived at all. [4/a] From the aspect of intrinsically radiant (mdangs) clarity it is called “self-originated pristine consciousness.” Since it does not change in aspect, it is called “original mind (sems),” “original mind (yid),” “naturally luminous mind,” “the vajra of mind,” “the vajra of space that pervades space” and so on. Even though there is an explanation with many different names, all of them are not different in meaning than dharmatā of the mind, the nondual dhātu and vidyā, or bodhicitta, the ultimate reality is like a vajra.
 
Therefore, since the so called “dharmadhātu” is not understood to be only empty, it is the emptiness that possesses the supreme of all aspects, whole and indivisible from luminosity. Though it is called “self-originated pristine consciousness,” the subjective mind that realizes the emptiness of the duality, and of subject and object, does not know conditioned signs. It is also necessary to understand that such natural clarity does not have an iota of a sign that can be designated as conditioned.

The bodhicitta mentioned in the mind series of the Great Perfection, the dharmadhātu mentioned in the space series, the self-originated pristine consciousness mentioned in the intimate instruction series, the dharmadhātu mentioned in the Prajñāpāramitā, the original mind mentioned in most of the mantra tantras and so on may have different names by virtue of their purposes, but since the meaning to understand is the pristine consciousness of that meaning which illustrates the union of knowing and emptiness, the reality of all phenomena, it is the original connate pristine consciousness. Since it is naturally settled dharmatā because it is not generated by the traces of transmigration’s three appearances, it is called the great bliss that is free from all pain of transmigration.

There is no need to remove "mind" from the sentence, since rig pa is knowledge that a mind has, apart from which, no rig pa is possible. This is the reason why prajñā and vidyā are synonymous. For example, Vimalamitra in the Vima sNying thig, among the five definitions of vidyā, which are contextual, states first that vidyā is "a clear nonconceptual consciousness contaminated by many consciousnesses." The second type is the vidyā that appropriates the basis (meaning the body) existing in the body, generates consciousness, existing within its own clarity, also termed, "unripened vidyā." The third type of vidyā is the one that exists in the basis, defined as possessing three pristine consciousness of essence, nature and compassion. The fourth is defined as the vidyā of insight, vipaśyāna, having to do with the visions. The fifth is the vidyā of thögal, here meaning vidyā at the conclusion of the fourth vision. 

In the end, all five of these are just means of talking about one's own mind and it's knowledge of its own state or lack thereof, since all five of these vidyās, Vimalamitra points, are essentially the same.

"Rigpa" is just a mind that is undeluded concerning its own state. Apart from that, there is no other "rigpa."

You can put scare quotes around "mind" and make all kinds of distinctions in English around words you have not defined nor clarified; but the basic reality is this: Dzogchen teachings describe how sentient beings become deluded, and how to remedy that delusion with the path.

No, seeing that the display of the mind as your own state is called "rigpa."

For example, how do "sense organs rise up from the basis" in the following citation from the sgra thal gyur?

since the buddhas did not become deluded,
the sense organs that rose up out of the basis
recognized the self-appearances as natureless

For that matter, how would one account for this citation as well? 

In the basis, totally undifferentiated
and undefined,
consciousness is grasped as moving, vanishing,
and spreading out,
and holding taints through accumulation.

Moreover, we here have a citation from the commentary on the sgra thal gyur would adds more understanding:

In Ati, the pristine consciousness—subsumed by the consciousness which apprehends primordial liberation and the abiding basis as ultimate—is inseparable in all buddhas and sentient beings as a mere consciousness. Since the ultimate pervades them without any nature at all, it is contained within each individual consciousness.

Again, the so called generic basis is set of qualities which all consciousnesses share. 

Even when we get to defining sems, what does the sgra thal gyur say?

Sems enters the pure and impure
three realms, and also buddhahood.

The basis has an aspect of consciousness, as the Six Dimensions clearly states:

If that aspect of pristine consciousness did not exist, 
it would not be any different than the physical matter of the four elements.

If it were the case that the basis was single entity, there could not be separation of samsara and nirvana. How can delusion be accounted for, which is the whole reason for describing the basis? As Vimalamitra further states:

[D]elusion arises from the difference between the basis and the conscious aspect of the basis. 

If the basis is some unitary entity, this conscious aspect would have to be unitary, etc., in the sense that it would there could be no diversity. But when it is understood that the basis is generic set of attributes of every consciousness, there are no contradictions which remain. 

In other words, Dzogchen is describing a phenomenology of liberation and delusion, and the language around the so called "basis" is merely a starting point for discussing that which we are deluded about. What we are deluded about is the nature our own states, and apart from a stream of empty consciousness, there is no other state that is under discussion.

The basis is just your mind. Not your thoughts, not its content, etc. It has three qualities, essence, nature, and compassion. 

There is no basis apart from your mind, in its unfabricated, unmodified state. If this wasn't the case, your nonrecognition of the five lights would not result in samsara, and your recognition of the five lights would not result in buddhahood. But in any case, it is just your own mind and its characteristics we are discussing. These five lights are just the result of the stirring of vāyu which is the internal movement of your own consciousness prior its self-recognition/nonrecognition. 

Now, you don't have to accept the Dzogchen account of the basis and the arising of the basis, and that is just fine with me. But let's not pretend that Dzogchen has some other kind basis in mind than the one I have just described. 

From the point of view of the potentiality of the basis, your own consciousness, the basis is luminosity; from the point of the essence of the basis, your own consciousness, the basis is emptiness free from extremes. This emptiness and luminosity are inseparable, and are the essence and nature of your own mind. This is all very clearly explained in Dzogchen texts, I am not sure why you have a problem with this.་

Further, the basis is only called "the basis" because one has not realized this.

No, this is not the case. Why are you introducing two truths through back into the conversation?

Emptiness is unconditioned, so is luminosity. Conditioned/unconditioned, this is just a mental reification. 

In any case, all fires are hot, all water is wet, all minds are empty and luminous. This is not a problem. 

"There is no mind in the mind, but the nature (prakṛiti) of the mind is luminousity."
