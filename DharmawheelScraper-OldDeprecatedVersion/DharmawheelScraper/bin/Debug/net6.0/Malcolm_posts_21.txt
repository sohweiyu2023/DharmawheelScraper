Sapan indicates that mantras should be pronounced in accordance with Sanskrit. Pronunciations like bajra/bazra have Indic justifications, for example these pronunciations reflect Kashmiri lineages. Sapan notes such Indic regional variations. Personally I follow Sapan on this point, with certain exceptions where Tibetan or Apabramsa words are part of the mantra.

Benza, etc., are wrong and reflect Tibetan pronunciations of the Tibetan vowel ‘a’ before consonants.

Buddhadharma is about liberation, all kinds of liberation, since all kinds of liberation require giving up some measure of affliction, whether towards, class, race, rank, etc. Hence Buddhadharma is inherently liberal.

No one denies that lay people are capable of attaining Buddhahood. But that was not the substance of your claim. The fact is that in Indian and Tibetan history the vast majority of gurus have been monks. Simply put, being a qualified Vajrayana master takes a lot of education and training, and that training is generally undertaken at tantric colleges by monastics.

Evidence of this may be found in the fifty verses of guru devotion where monks are given a pass for not prostrating to lay gurus. It is also clearly explained here too that monks who maintain all three vows are the best sort of gurus.

Karmamudra is not required for levels of awakening up to the tenth bhumi.

It is completely unneeded in Dzogchen and certain lineages from Naropa.

Both partners, not just one. If both partners are experienced, they can easily tell. 

Classically, in India, one would train a partner personally, taking them through Hinayāna, Mahāyāna, and finally present them to one's guru for abhisheka, and then support their training until they were sufficiently well trained to engage in karmamudra practice-- in the meantime one would rely on a jñānamudra. 

We live in a degenerate era, so these procedures and safeguards are not being followed in many cases.

And it is true. 

Additionally, Osel Mukpo really ought to seek professional help for his very evident alcoholism. 

During the time I spent in Dharmadhatu communities in the late '80's and early 90's, I witnessed an amazing amount of alcoholism in the Dharmadhatu culture. I have observed the same behavior in other communities, mostly Nyimgma, including Dzogchen Community (though here it is actively discouraged by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu). Alcoholism is a fairly widespread problem in Tibetan Buddhism, at least in the Nyingma tradition, and it leads to many of the problems we see here. I know of at least three Tibetan Buddhist teachers who have died due to problems related to drinking, including CTR. It is time we acknowledge that in some Tibetan Buddhist communities there is a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol. There are at least three translators that I know who are chronic alcoholics. 

All in all it is a serious issue.

Tibetans clans are not like Scottish clans with a laird, etc., though CTR appropriated the latter. 

The Mukpo tribe, located in Kham, is part of the a larger tribe, the sDong. 

Of course, the founder of the Khon clan, Namlha Yuring, tamed all the eighteen branches of the sDong, and made them vassals. This is why the Khon are really the bosses of all sDong, including the Mukpos.     

With respect to the Mukpo tribe, all this business about CTR being head of this tribe is nonsense. 

Of course, there is a saying about the Mukpos:

"The descendants of the Mugpo Dong race think only of conquering other peoples."

With respect to the root downfall, to use an unripened women or man for actual karmamudra practice is a root downfall, covered in the seventh root downfall, declaring secrets. Then of course there is the fourteenth root downfall, denigrating women, who are the nature of wisdom. Treating women poorly, not displaying loving kindness towards them, etc., is not only a breaking the fourteenth root downfall, but also the fourth, not to abandon love for sentient beings. 

With respect to the branch downfalls, the first branch downfall is having sexual intercourse with a women or man who does not possess samaya, that is, someone who is unripened by empowerment, or someone who has broken their samaya. 

Actually, engaging in conduct that contradicts the Buddha's teachings is itself a root downfall, the second.

Tabi: Trigger warning–this is not a nice, devotional story about CTR.
The first time I met His Majesty Chögyam Trungpa Rincophe was at encampment in the late summer of 1983. I was attending a dathün (month long sitting practice) at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center. This retreat is supposed to be mostly silent, but I was never good at holding my tongue. During the retreat, some of my new friends and I plotted a raid on encampment, which was a military-style program that was simultaneously happening on the land. We decided to raid encampment and attempt to steal the flag. Our plan was simple: we could create a diversion and while the attention was on us, our cohorts would sneak around the perimeter and steal the flag. Three of us drove through the tori gates in a convertible blaring Michael Jackson’s Beat It while the rest tried to sneak around and steal the flag. We were all immediately caught and locked up in the stockade. CTR came by that night to check out the prisoners. I noticed that he flirted shamefully with all the women/girls who were in the lock-up and totally and completely ignored me.
But I really met CTR in the backyard wedding of sangha members in Boulder in late January of 1985. I had been prepped by the family I nannied for for weeks in advance of the wedding. It appeared to work because I caught CTR’s eye and he asked me to marry him the next day. Then there was so much activity! We had our charts read by Larry Laughlin who found the most “auspicious” day for our wedding. Given the tremendous constraints of marrying six women in a five months, there was some wiggle room with the dates. The first wedding I attended was Karen Lavin’s. Next was Valerie Lorig Sanford, which happened on May 10th. Then Lady Cynde Grieves married him on May 13, Wendy Friedman was on May 17th, I was the fifth on June 12th, Ciel followed on her 18th brithday, and then Agness had her wedding in December of 1985.
There was so much to be done–especially for me as a new student who only completed through level four Shambhala training. I received stroke, lungta and werma transmission. I read Born in Tibet, and studied the Letter of the Golden Key Which fulfills desire, The Golden Dot, The Letter of the Black Ashe, Sacred World, the Practice of Warriorship, and Court Vision and Practice. I was on the fast track to learning and absorbing everything he’d ever created. I studied the texts themselves as well as the commentaries. Our ceremonies required correctly answering a direct question from CTR and the preceptor, who in my case was the regent. (Mine was the only ceremony with him as the preceptor–people said I should be honored–but I was not.) We were told to study the Six Ways of Ruling in particular, as it was rumored this would be one of the questions.
When I wasn’t with CTR, I was completing my tasks as a nanny. And I was introduced to the Shambhala lodge with a party in my honor. I attended Karen, Cynde, Wendy and Valerie’s ceremonies prior to mine. These all happened at the court in Boulder. We had dinners together where we were taught elocution by both Ashley Playfair and Carolyn Gimian. We had one dinner with CTR and the five of us Sangyum (Karen, Cynde, Wendy, Val and I), where we were served white fish with bones in it, green peas and white rice, and copious amounts of sake. We were learning how to eat like the British–holding our fork upside down in our left hand and our knife in the right to shovel the food onto the fork, not an easy task with that meal. During meals we usually played the qualities game, a parlor game CTR enjoyed.
One day I arrived at the court for a shift and I was told I was to receive another transmission from Marty Janowitz. I assumed this was to be like the others, perhaps he was giving me TGS transmission early. Marty told me this transmission was extremely sacred and was only known to a few close students. He then pulled out a vial filled with a white powdery substance. Marty told me it was ground up vitamin D or something. (I really can’t remember exactly what he said it was). He put a bit of it on the spoon and told me to rub it on my gums, which I did. It was not cocaine. It was part of our job description to always carry a vial of “Tabi” which was the code name for cocaine. Due to his paralysis, CTR only had the use of one hand, so when he called for tabi it was our job to go into the bathroom with him, keep him steady, help him get his penis out before he wet his pants and put the coke on a spoon for him to inhale. It was also our job to keep his nose clean, and as you can tell from the picture, we were not always successful. Later, when I went to the bathroom alone, I put some on my gums. It was definitely cocaine.
This is another secret I have kept for over 30 years. I can no longer keep it. I believe it is not of benefit to anyone to keep this secret anymore. I believe it’s important for the followers of Shambhala to know what really happened in the “inner circle” of the court. We all–every one of us–didn’t know how to say “no” to CTR. We were so busy tripping over each other to do his bidding that we never questioned why an enlightened mediation master would need copious amounts of cocaine and alcohol every day. We never questioned why he spoke of every woman or young girl in sexual terms. It was supposed to be a great honor to sleep with him. No one wondered if his sexual appetite for his female students might be unhealthy.
I started wondering about it shortly after Ciel’s suicide. Could this sexualized idea of women be unhealthy? Could this lack of boundaries eventually result in rage and self-hatred? Why did I think marrying a man with seven other wives, a serious drug addiction, alcoholism and suicidal tendencies shown as severe bulimia would be a good idea? I was 23 and vulnerable. And I said yes. Yes, I will do this strange thing. It was only later when I learned of power differentials and feminism that I truly understood how totally wrong it all was. And now I am triggered by all things Tibetan. I will never enter Karma Dzong again. It’s too painful to see the hero worship and the enshrinement of this deeply disturbed man. And for those of you who might have spent a few nights with him or more and feel they knew all there was to know about him, I ask you to dig deeper. And for those of you who never met him yet still follow his teachings, you might want to ask hard questions of those in the know.
The most shocking thing for me through this whole process of sharing my truth is the sheer number of people who are lying now, and denying that sexualized violence has a negative effect on women. This continued minimization of the real, undeniable scars that are left from sexual assault and harassment is shocking. Shambhala has had choices every step of the way since we have begun talking about the neglect and child rape and abuse that is the legacy CTR left his close students. And this deplorable view of women continues through his sons. Time’s Up Now.

The differences in how these schools manifest the body of light aka jñānakāya, lay in differences in their completion stages, but the result is the same. 

In terms of advancement, all require intense dedication, years of solitary retreat, and so on in order to manifest buddhahood in one lifetime. All also offer the prospect of liberation at the time of death or in the bardo for those of us who are less diligent.

Sakya Pandita asserts in the Muni's Intent that that Dzogchen is the name of the result of the nine Yānas of the Nyingma school, Mahāmudra is the name of the result of the new tantras. ChNN agrees with Sakya Pandita's perspective on this, so when he states that the result of Mahāmudra and Dzogchen are the same, he is referring to Mahāmudra as it is understood in the Sakya school, not the Kagyu school.

There is no body method in sūtra, so that result is not available to sūtra practitioners. 

Further, that mahāmudra and dzogchen are equivalent is stated by Karma Charmed in his Mountain Dharma:

Mahāmuda and Mahāsandhi 
are different names, but do not differ in meaning. 

Many other great masters make the same observation.

Hi Marc, there is no result higher than anuttarasamyaksambuddhahood. 

The thirteenth Bhumi described in Nyingma texts is not the same as the thirteenth Bhumi described in sarma tantras, where it is the equivalent of the Nyingma 16th Bhumi.

As we have seen above, it is the opinion of Buddhist masters that the result of mahamudra (two stages) and Dzogchen are the same.

This in fact is how the Gelukpas explain illusory body in relation to the Guhyasamaja tradition. The way it is explained in Sakya by Gorampa Sonam Seng-ge is different. Here too he explains the illusory body as the actual transformation of the physical body, not a new body that arises after death. So there is a great difference here.  

However, Sachen's explanation does not use the term rainbow body, and uses the term 'od kyi sku, aka body of light.

You need to learn some history. 

The Fifth Dalai Lama did not suppress the Karma Kagyus and Jonangpas out of sectarianism. He did so because these two lineages were patronized by the King of Tsang, Karma Tenkyong Wangpo (1606-1642), who, along with the Karma Kamstang in general, was himself personally an committed enemy of the Gelugpa school. In other words, he did so in order to defend the Gelug school. 

I suggest you do some reading the history of Tibetan Buddhism before making rash and baseless claims.

For example, when going for refuge, the student repeats the formula of going for refuge three times after the teacher. The teacher then explains the vows and commitments of going for refuge, and in this way the student formally becomes a follower of Buddhadharma and also received lay vows.  

Monastic vows, bodhisattva vows, and the vows of secret mantra are administered the same way.

Of this line, Candra's autocommentary states:

"Since the entities of the worldly are established without analysis, they exist, thus everything is established."

The key point here is that the entities that the worldly perceive are not analyzed, and thus in this way, they are established only prior to analysis.

But this is not an argument that conventionally valid entities possess natures. 

Indeed, in in the root text, Candra states very clearly:

Likewise, entities lack a nature (rang bzhin) indeed,
but saying "existence" is shown to be the provisional meaning.

And:

The absence of a nature in phenomena
is the so-called emptiness shown by the wise.

Bhavaviveka agrees in the Blaze of Reasoning:

Once it is accepted that that entities do not arise intrinsically (rang bzhin gyis), they are termed "non-arisen." Since the truth is the absence of a nature (rang bzhin med), nothing arises intrinsically (rang bzhing gyis).

What do you mean by "nature?" Most people mean something that is intrinsic to a given thing. For example, common people assume the nature of fire is heat, the nature of water is wetness, and so on.

As Āryadeva puts it, realization depends on view. Further, liberation depends on realization. Thus, if one's view is wrong, one realization will be faulty, and if one's realization is faulty, liberation is not a possibility in this life, the bardo, or the next, unless or until one meets the Dharma and discovers the right view by depending on a virtuous mentor. 

Such lamas and teachers, are either naive, or in the attempt to be kind to those who come to Buddhadharma with strong clinging to their past religious upbringing, can actually do a disservice to their students by making such statements. The experience of the dissolution of the body that sentient beings have during the death process are generic, and the hallucinations that people have during this process are irrelevant to the process itself.  See 226-234 of Gyurme Dorje's translation, The Tibetan Book of the Dead: the First Complete Translation. 

For example, on page 233, for those people without a yidam, it says "Meditate on the Lord of Great Compassion," which any Tibetan will readily know how to do.  But since Jesus, Mary, Krishna, Shiva, etc. are not buddhas, and are not connected to a Buddhist path through being defined as an excellent yidam, there is no ultimate benefit in telling people to focus on these religious figures during their death process, apart from giving them comfort. Giving a dying person comfort is a desiderata of course, but in this it is merely a palliative, and will at best lead them to rebirth again in the three higher realms. This is not a bad thing, but let us not kid ourselves into thinking such an experience "could be integrated into a teaching that placed liberation as a preferable outcome."

Even telling them to focus on an activity deity such as Jambhala is of no benefit, since these activity deities are not complete paths. Only bodhisattvas like Mañujuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Tāra, and so on will function in this way for ordinary people who have no regular yidam practice.

Liberation is defined as being free from affliction. If one is afflicted, one is not liberated no matter what external conditions might prevail or what prayers one might recite. 

No one can hand liberation to you. The idea that one can be saved by another is an externalist, eternalist, theistic view. It is not compatible with the Buddha's teachings.

This is all completely beside the point. ChNN certainly does not think Christianity, etc., are liberative traditions —— if he did, it would be clear in the Game of Liberation. In fact, in that game, the only way "out" is through Buddhist paths.

Are you making the assertion that use of the term “unconditioned” renders all traditions that use the term compatible? The sugatagarbha doctrine has a few variations, for example, the Lanka equates it with the all-basis consciousness. As I understand the term, tathagatagarbha refers to the union of the mind”s clarity and emptiness. That union is unconditioned, but the mind itself is conditioned. Just this is the “god” ChNN is referring to, and nothing else, since the basis is just this.

The ālaya-vijñāna is not an object of consciousness.

I refer you to the Buddha on this point. 

"When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, his mind is already seized, debased, &amp; misdirected by the thought: 'May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed. May they not exist': If others then strike him down &amp; slay him while he is thus striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle. But if he holds such a view as this: 'When a warrior strives &amp; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down &amp; slay him while he is striving &amp; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle,' that is his wrong view.

Kāśypa started laughing at the sight and his student, frankly, was a little shocked. "Why are you laughing at that man kicking a dog?" he asked. Kāśyapa replied, "I am laughing because unbeknownst to that man, he is eating his mother and kicking his father. Samsara is a terrible place."

Yes, I am aware that Kurt does not mention the mi zhigs thig le, but they are the same thing. For example, when the Hevajra Tantra states:

Great wisdom is present in the body,
perfectly free from all concepts,
pervading all things,
present in, but not arising from the body.


Or for example, in Buddhahood, Vimalamitra is quoted as saying:

The ultimate bindu of light,
the size of a mustard seed, arises clearly;
its self-illuminating light exists as round,
immaculate, and beyond the extremes of permanence and
annihilation.

The tīrthika view is held to be as following in the Rangshar:

The view that the cause is permanent holds that there is a substantial
cause in the center of one’s heart center that is round,
white, the size of a bean, does not come from the father, does
not grow through the condition of the mother, and is held to be
permanent.

In Buddhadharma however, the mi zhigs thig le is composed of elements from one's father and mother. This is very clearly described here by Padmasambhava in the Kandro Nyingthig:

[T]o begin with, the material bindu of the father and mother is created by it [vidyā], [they] are inseparable. On the other hand, the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses are a luminous emptiness not established as some kind of entity, and are free of birth and death. But this body created by a cause is perishable. [438] If one thinks there is contradiction with the former characteristic, that has not been understood. Since that critical point of luminous empty vidyā was not recognized, grasping onto that [luminous empty vidyā] produced the five elements, and the material bindu [was produced] from the refined part of those [five elements.

Basically, the Bonpo "tshon gang" is just talking about this, and when it is being discussed from the point of view of Dzogchen practice it is talked about one way, and when being talked about from the point of view of general tantric anatomy, it is discussed another way.

Afflictions do not necessarily produce volitions. When we are aware of our afflictive state, we can disengage our minds from actions related towards afflictive objects. This is why we practice śamatha, actually, so that we are aware of our mind's afflictive state. Being aware of our mind's afflictive state is called mindfulness and attention. Being unaware of our mind's afflictive stated is called being mindless and inattentive.

No, this is not even remotely true. 

However, the bardo is not a "transgression realm." It is just the space between lives. 

Also, the doctrine around Akaniṣṭha is complicated since it is understood differently in sūtra, tantra, and the Great Perfection.

Greg: the four or six bardos is a doctrine exclusive to Dzogchen Man ngag sde (that is, it is not found in sems sde or klong sde, or anu or mahāyoga). In the new schools, there is only one bardo.

The Treasury of the Abhidharma and its (Auto)commentary

No, basically. If your karma is to be born a wealthy family, you will never be able to take rebirth in the womb of a poor mother. Why? Just as a fruit tree cannot flourish in poor soil, but various kinds of other plants can easily grow, a poor mother lacks the conditions to support the karmic causes one has accumulated if one has the karma to be born in a more materially fortunate position, on the other hand, your parents might be absolutely awful people, whereas your poor mother might be a saint. Karma is complex.

Karma is the driving force behind where one is born in samsara. 

However, karma does not form ideologies and philosophies. If you believe this, then you will be forced accept the consequence one's beliefs are predetermined. At best, all one can say that one's  karmic predispositions towards certain ways of thinking one held in past lives may color what religion, if any, one might seek out in this life. And if one does not have a precious human birth with eight freedoms and ten endowments, what does not matter what one believes. One is not going to get out of samsara anytime soon. Given this is so, all these worldly political theories and social systems are irrelevant. It is one's personal actions that determine where one takes rebirth. For nonbuddhists, to the extent which their religious or moral beliefs compel them to engage in positive deeds of body, voice, and mind and avoid negative deeds, to that extent they will take rebirth in higher realms in samsara. But it really does not matter what religious or social beliefs they hold as long as they engage in the ten virtuous actions and avoid the ten nonvirtuous actions. Even so, without having a precious human birth, they are not getting off the train of samsara. 

Of course, one of the reasons it is hard for nonbuddhist to get off that train is that they all engage in the mental nonvirtue of ignorance. This also the case for buddhists. If we do not cultivate correct mundane view, then we won't get off the train either.

What it means is that "emptiness" below the path of seeing is a result of analysis via the four extremes. Since four extremes are not valid for entities in the relative, there is nothing in the ultimate that exists by way of the four extremes either. 

On this point, there is no difference between Sakya and Nyingma.

It is summarized by Śantideva in this way (paraphrase) "when neither an entity nor a nonentity remain before the mind, there being no other alternative, the mind is pacified."

The misrepresented Hashang means trying to have no thoughts.

Even the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras teach us that all phenomena are pure from the start. Those very words occur within them. But I see where our misunderstanding comes from. Garab Dorje, aka Vajraprahe (as his name is given in the tantras) told Mañjuśrīmitra that awakening was beyond cause and effect. But cause and effect are a different topic that karma and dependent origination. Why is awakening beyond cause and effect in Dzogchen? Because it exists to be introduced, but without that introduction, it will never be discovered. This is why Dzogchen is part of secret mantra and not sūtra.

Yes, this is what we mean when we say that one can have a direct perception of another's mind. 

What you cite here is not even slightly different than what I said. Therefore, one can know another's thoughts, because thoughts have characteristics and so forth, which are perceptible to those who possess the abhijña of knowing the minds of others.

Apprehending the blue vase in another person knows, for such people, is exactly the same as direct perception of a blue vase; first the blueness, etc, of the representation in the mind of another is apprehended, and then it is constructed as the blue vase they have perceived in one's own mind. The process is identical. This is not hard to understand.

Simply put, no. Being conditioned is not commensurate with being contaminated. For example, path dharmas are conditioned, but they are pure.

Astus, of course an image is a representation. All perceptions of characteristics are representational. 

For example, there is a story of a monk of whom devas were fond. They cast theirs mind forth one day, looking for this monk, and unable to locate him, they went to the Buddha and asked what had become of him. The Buddha replied, "Why, he became an arhat, he is sitting right there in samadhi." 

What had happened? The arhat in samadhi was not grasping any signs, and so his mind disappeared from the mental sight of these devas.

No, we do not promote class in Buddhism, but we also do not ignore it. We accept as a matter of course, that people with positive karma are born more attractive, healthy, long-lived, intelligent, moral, access to wealth and so on. People with negative karma are less attractive, healthy, long-lived, intelligent, moral, access to wealth and so on. And of course, based on the mixture of karma we possess, we are all mixtures of these things; some people born into high positions in society are ugly, immoral, not so smart, etc. Others born into lower positions are attractive, long lived, moral, etc. 

The position into which one is born is not a guarantee of future returns. IN samsara, one day a king, the next day a beggar. This is common.

Interbeing is an extension of dependent origination, based on East Asian ideas. 

But dependent origination, when reduced to its essential components, simply means: where there is affliction, there is a cause for action; where there is action there is a cause for suffering; and where there is suffering, there is a condition for further affliction. Without affliction, there is no cause for action; without action, there is no result, suffering.

The anger, desire and ignorance  of those people in less fortunate positions in samsara will lead to their lower birth in samsara if they act on it an carry out nonvirtuous deeds. Just as the anger, desire, ignorance of of people in more fortunate positions in samsara will likewise lead to their lower birth in samsara. However, the patience, compassion, and wisdom of people in less fortunate positions in samsara will lead to their higher birth in samsara, just as the patience, compassion, and wisdom of people in more fortunate positions in samsara will lead to their higher birth in samsara. 

Karma is unerring. While one's birth in more or less fortunate places in samsara is a result of one's past karma, one's future place in samsara is assured by one's actions in this life. Thus, actions due to hatred, desire, and ignorance inevitably take one but one way: down.

Revolutions,  punitive actions, as well as deliberate oppression, only lead one way: to lower realms.

Samadhi/dhyāna is a natural mental factor, we all have it. The problem is that we naturally allow this mental factor to rest on afflictive objects such as HBO, books, video games, etc. 

Śamatha practice is the discipline of harnessing our natural predisposition for concentration, and shifting it from afflictive conditioned phenomena to nonafflictive conditioned phenomena, i.e., the phenomena of the path. We do this in order to create a well tilled field for the growth of vipaśyāna. Śamatha ultimately allows us to have mental stability and suppresses afflictive mental factors so that we may eventually give rise to authentic insight into the nature of reality. While it is possible to have vipaśyāna without cultivating śamatha, it is typically quite unstable and lacks the power to effectively eradicate afflictive patterning from our minds.  Therefore, the basis of all practice in Buddhadharma, from Abhidharma to the Great Perfection, is the cultivation of śamatha as a preliminary practice for germination of vipaśyāna.

Do you want to know why there is a Sahara desert. Humans made it from grazing goats. You want to know where all the megafauna in N. America went, they were killed of thousands of years ago by "native" Americans.

Indeed, however, there is no world in which a campaign to inform everyone she is suffering from severe misconceptions will have any effect on anyone who has the (sad) karma to wind up being her student. 

And, Dorje Drakden may be engaged in bringing Oshun to heel. After all, even though Pehar was tamed by Guru P, it took many successive episodes of taming by the mahāisiddhas of Tibet to fully bring him to heel as well.

I doubt this is a fabrication, and frankly, I do not suspect the people involved of running a con. Their motivation seems sincere. They just know very little about the trance medium tradition in Tibet, they know almost nothing of Tibetan Buddhism in general, and they certainly do not understand the concept of worldly entities being emanations, or messengers, or servants, of awakened beings. So, with that in mind, we should be a little gentle with these people.

Predicted response: Sherab will argue that precedence is not sufficiently reasonable. 

Tsongkhapa fan will bring up the fact that Tsongkhapa seems to have used two mediums in his career: a Nyingmapa Lama through whom he had a conversation with Vajrapani to remove his doubts about Dzogchen teachings; and Lama Umapa, through whom he had conversations with Mañjuśrī and clarified his doubts about Madhyamaka. Frankly, in my reading of these accounts, it actually appears that it was on account of Tsongkhapa's own pure vision that he perceived these masters as Vajrapani and Mañjuśrī, since the former was someone whose main practice was Vajrapani Maṇḍalacakra, and the latter was someone whose main practice was Vajrabhairava, respectively. However, the way that Khedrupje composed the secret bio of Tsongkhapa, it is made to appear as if Tsongkhapa relied on Umapa as a sku rten, a trance medium, and this is surely a mistake. There is no fault at all in having pure vision of one's master as this bodhisattva or that, or even as Buddha Vajradhara in person. But there is a very great fault in suggesting that buddhas and bodhisattvas on the stages resort to trance mediums to speak the Dharma.

Jvalamukha teaches the Dharma to pretas in their own form. Śākyamuni Buddha teaches Dharma to humans in their own form, etc. Also, this doctrine is very specific to the mandala of peaceful and wrathful deities, and should not be confused with the Buddha's actual career. The Buddha himself, during his sojourn in this world, appeared in the hell realms to beings there, and also the deva realms to the beings there. 

As mentioned above, the mode of teachings of the Buddha has been ascertained to be three and three only: the vacana of his own voice, blessed vacana, and permitted vacana, and no fourth kind has ever been mentioned or ascertained such as vacana through trance mediums, channelers, tarot cards, seances, and so on. This is distinct from the Tibetan custom of the using trance mediums of reliable, mundane entities such as Nechung, Tseringma, and so on for oracular predictions about worldly matters.

The invocation of āryas such as Mañjuśrī, Śrī Devi, and so on for divinations must be understood as an invocation of their blessing, not their presence through mediums —&nbsp;thus it is completely different and must not be confused with the possession of trance mediums by worldly spirits.

Indeed the Buddha gives teachings in three ways: directly with his own voice, by blessing, or by permission. 

However, there isn't a single example in the sūtras or tantras where the Buddha gives teachings by literally possessing and then speaking through the body of another being in the manner of being a channelled entity. Further, these three modes of teaching were confined to the duration during which the Buddha was physically present in his nirmanakāya in this world, 2500 years ago. For this reason, apart from teachings of the sambhogkāya revealed by the mahāsiddhas of India and Tibet, there have been no new Dharmas in the world since then. 

You might suppose, "In the world other buddhas have arisen, albeit not supreme nirmanakāyas, what is to prevent them from possessing the bodies of others and speaking through them." 

1) No more than three modes of the Buddha's granting teachings have been identified in the sūtras by the paṇḍitas of India and Tibet. 2) There is no example in sūtra or tantra of such an occurrence, in other words, there is not a single example of Buddha giving teachings through a medium (sku rten).  3) Since the Buddha's nirmanakāya is no longer present in the world, also the three kinds of teachings are complete. 4) Among the beings the Buddha blessed or permitted to teach Dharma, it is only āryaśrāvakas and āryabodhisattvas who received such blessing or permission. 5) By inference, worldly devas and humans are not proper vehicles to be given permission to speak for the Buddha via blessing and permission since there is no example of Buddha giving such worldly people blessing or permission to speak for him. 6) Māra can appear in any guise, including that of a buddha or a bodhisattva, so it is unsound to consider the utterances of trance mediums to be valid Dharma. How is one to determine whether such teachings have a valid source or not?  We have already seen the negative effects in Tibet of mistaking worldly entities who possess mediums as buddhas. 

Therefore, the idea that buddhas can speak through trance mediums must be utterly rejected both because it is an irrational supposition and because if it is accepted that such a phenomena is valid, many distorted teachings will enter the world, as is already the case with respect to those insufficiently wise to avoid such spurious teachings.
