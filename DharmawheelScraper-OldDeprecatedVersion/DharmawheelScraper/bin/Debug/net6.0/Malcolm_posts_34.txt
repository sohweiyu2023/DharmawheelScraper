Drollo is a manifestation of Guru P. Drollo is also a yidam. They are not the same thing. The former is the result; the later is a path. Yidam practice is the method of taking the result as the path. 

Hevajra, for example, is a heruka. Vajradhara manifested as Hevajra in order to tame the eight worldly gods. In this respect, Hevajra represents the result. Practicing Hevajra as a yidam is the path, in this case too, the result is taken as the path.

Yes, because Avalokiteśvara is a tenth stage bodhisattva, who is a being who has a separate continuum from you. 

But for example, Hevajra was never a bodhisattva on the paths and stages, per se, there is no being with a separate continuum "Hevajra". The Hevajra mandala is a method taught by Vajradhara in the Hevajra Tantra to the tenth stage bodhisattva Vajragarbha.

If you mean a yidam is a method taught by the Sambhogakāya, sure, no problem. 

The problem here, is that you are not properly distinguishing what is a method and what is not. 

For example, when Buddha demonstrated to King Indrabhuti the Guhyasamaja Mandala, that mandala display was being demonstrated as a method to Indrabhuti. It was not being displayed as some external being to whom Indrabhuti was supposed to make offerings and petition for blessings. It was being shown to Indrabhuti to illustrate the pure appearances of the aggregates, sense bases and sense elements of Indrabhuti's own continuum. The latter understood this, and attained Buddhahood on the spot, and in turn, taught the Guhyasamaja Mandala to his kingdom. This can be applied to all instances of the communication of yidam methods in the tantras.

No, a Yidam is not a sentient being possessing its own continuum. It is a method, that is all. People who do not understand this point, whether Tibetan or Western, do not understand Vajrayāna. 

In other words, yidams exist as methods, but not as sentient beings. There is no external Kalacakra existing somewhere whom we petition for blessings when we do a Kalacakra sadhana.

Both. His communication with Padmasambhava was part of his own experiential vision. But he also was a person who was highly realized bodhisattva (IMO) on the paths and stages, and so his vision was not confined to the (impure) nirmanakāya level of perception, as is ours. 

But if you ever told him his experience of Padmasambhava was real, he would have had a good chuckle at that notion.

The creation stage and completion stage, ideally, are merged from the start. However, to directly address your question, the issue is not real/unreal, the issue is impure/pure. The creation stage exists to break attachment to impure appearances, that's all. Nothing more. The completion exists to break attachments to pure appearances, nothing more. 

Further, this is the point of starting out from emptiness. The deity arises from emptiness. That means even at the beginning of the practice you must realize the deity is unreal. If you do not realize from the start that the deity is unreal, the process of transforming your vision from impure to pure will never happen.

Ultimately, there is no deity, just as there is no person. All of these methods are just skillful means to cut clinging to impure appearances by training in pure appearances. 

The point of the completion stage is to eliminate the idea that the deity you imagine yourself as is real. This is why you dissolve the deity into the state of emptiness at the end of a sadhana. Why? Impure appearances are not are real and pure appearances are not real.

You wonder about my background: I was not raised in any religion, was never baptized, and my parents are confirmed atheists. I have only been to a Christian service three time in my life, all as an adult: High Episcopalian Xmas masses twice, and a Congregationalist service. 

I remain bewildered at why people need such a concept in their lives. And since there is no concept in any traditional Buddhadharma text, I really fail to see why it is so hard to understand that HHST and ChNN are attempting to speak to those people from theistic backgrounds.

He also said:

The very meaning of the Tibetan term Dzogchen, "Great Perfection," refers to the true primordial state of every individual and not to any transcendent reality.

"Divine" means "of, from, or like God or a god..."

But compassion and wisdom in Buddhadharma does not come from a god. It flows out of the empathy and understanding of human beings, and is perfected in the case of a buddha. 

Just in case you forgot, of the six kinds of beings in the six realms, only human beings are capable of buddhahood.

I do not think this use of "polytheism" is very precise.  On the other hand, he is trying to help theists (like you) get a handle on the multiplicity of buddhas in Buddhadharma— so it is forgivable, despite being a stretch. 

Buddhism is only a polytheism in the sense that it recognizes the existence of the polytheistic pantheon of ancient India. 

If we "worship" iṣta-devatas, yidams, as external beings, then our practice becomes Nonbuddhist. Rather than being a insider practice, it becomes an outsider practice. One might object and claim, "In Kriya tantra we are instructed to visualize the deity like a minister petitioning a king, therefore this is a kind of external practice." In reply, while it is true that in Kriya tantra, we generate the deity before us while remaining in our ordinary form, the point is that we are "generating" the deity. This is something we are visualizing, so therefore, even though it may seem externally directed, unlike Vedic practice (where one worships mundane, external sentient beings such as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva), there is nothing to be found which is not a product of one's own minds.

There is no divine compassion or wisdom apart from the nature of the mind. People who realize that nature of the mind fully are buddhas. People who have partially realized that are called "bodhisattvas." People who aspire to realize that are called "practitioners." People who have no interest in that at all are called "ordinary sentient beings."

No one teaches that the jñānasattva is in fact some relative entity (much less an ultimate entitiy) that can be summoned with a mudra and a mantra from "over there" to "over here." 

The summing and absorption of the jñānasattva is an empowerment drama (recapitulated in daily sadhana practice), meant to symbolize the fact that while we have never been separate from the nature of the mind, we have not seen it up till now, and so therefore, the summoning of the jñānasattva is meant to dramatically emphasize this fact and bring it to our attention. 

And in lower tantras, the jñānasattva is dismissed "to its natural abode," which is why, among other reasons, that lower tantra is lower. And of course the meaning of this is that in post-equipoise, one readopts one's ordinary form, because now the mandala "drama" in your daily practice is finished. In higher tantra, of course, one is supposed to maintain the dramatic person of the yidam throughout all activities until it no longer feels like a dramatic persona, but instead, one really feels that one is the deity. 

There is no deity apart from the nature of one's mind. If someone thinks there is a deity apart from the nature of the mind, they have understood nothing at all about the creation stage, let alone the completion stage.

Objects of the three realms are never the problem. Indeed, the three realms are pure. 

And yes, proponents of essences often have more "renunciation" than proponents of emptiness. Why? Since they have no understanding of emptiness, they also have no understanding of purity. 

Further, form realms absorptions just are not all that.

Sūtrayāna is not a foundation for Vajrayāna in terms of the path. Loppon Sonam Tsemo, one of the five founder masters of Sakya, writes (citations excluded) in his General Presentation of Tantra. First with regard to the Sūtra path, he says:

[T]he Pāramitāyāna practitioner makes that basis into a path by giving it up.

He continues a little later:

First, the basis, as explained before, is the five desire objects. Those are the basis itself, but if it is the objects themselves, how are they to be given up? Since most people are totally fettered, how are [they] able to give up [the basis]? [The basis] is not to be given up. 

Now then, if one asks “Won’t there be bondage because of objects?” Those without a method will be bound, i.e., like common beings. If one possesses a method, liberation is assisted by those [objects] themselves. For example, like poison or like fire. Therefore, objects do not intrinsically create bondage. Bondage is created by the deceived concepts depending on those [objects]. For that reason, since one is liberated because of having given up the intrinsic cause of bondage [i.e. deceived concepts,] the objects which [earlier] became the condition of that [bondage] [now] become the condition of liberation.

"Indulging in defilements" is not what "using the sense pleasures" on the path means. 

For example, if you are a sūtra practitioner, it is ultimately considered ideal to give up sexual pleasure; in Vajrayāna, it is not, in fact, it is the opposite. 

Vajrayāna is the path devised by the Buddhas for the era (this one) when afflictions are so strong they cannot be abandoned; and therefore, since they are the ultimate causes of suffering, they must be transformed using the special methods of Vajrayāna, because in fact, they cannot be abandoned.

And further, Vajrayāna (for the 100th time) is not a path of renunciation, though one must develop weariness with respect to samsara to embark upon this path.

The Buddha did not stand on a street corner broadcasting his message like a radio, with no consideration of who was listening. Instead, Buddhadharma has spread on the basis of Dharma teachers teaching those who are interested that which they were interested to hear, and that which they were able to employ in their lives. 

Nor did the Buddha and his disciples stand on a street corner handing out handbills, with hopes that people would show up at his teachings. 

Proselytizing, the attempt to convert someone to one's own religion or set of beliefs, is the very opposite of the Buddha's project. Evangelism, in this instance the zealous advocacy of a cause or set of views, is also the very opposite of the Buddha's project. 

Buddhadharma has spread in the world due to the merit of sentient beings, and when that merit is finally exhausted, the Dharma will vanish at the same time.

The tendency towards awakening begins with the wish to escape suffering. The accumulation of merit begins when you wish others to escape suffering before you yourself escape suffering, just as when, under an ancient Śakyamuni, the being who eventually became our Śakyamuni wished that the guardians of hell torment him rather than the other beings in the hell realms.

Of course, any being who avoids the ten natural nonvirtues is accumulating (transient) merit as well.

Zen people, etc., do not practice the two stages. Why are you surprised by this? 

In India, there was a whole movement lead by such masters as Shrī Simha that basically argued that the creation stage is of no importance whatsoever. Only the perfection stage is of any import. Such a practice is called "Great Perfection," but even that practice is "Great Perfection practice" in name only.

I understand that given the close connection between Nyingma and Karma Kagyu, sometimes it is a struggle for Karma Kagyu to maintain its separate identity. It is no secret, for example, that Kongtrul's own personal practice was Dzogchen, specifically based around the Konchog Chidu cycle.

Liberation through seeing can be in the form of statues, mantras, and so on are that are recommended as such for such purposes. Of course, this idea has become popular, so it is natural that we see somewhat wider application of this principle in some schools outside of Nyingma. But the idea belongs to Dzogchen.

No, Padmasambhava clearly taught Dzogchen in the man ngag lta ba phreng ba. Vimalamitra definitely taught Dzogchen as well. 

While there is no doubt their lives have been heavily mythologized, there is no reason to doubt the introduction of Dzogchen to Tibet by Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra and Vairocana. Shri Siṃha as a Indian teacher of Dzogchen (i.e., completion stage without the need for creation stage) is independently confirmed in the treatises of Mañjuśrīkirti. Shri Siṃha was the teacher of all three.

You will find little support for Jax's views here. He does not seem to understand the difference between the basis and the path, nor that the basis refers to something that one has yet to realize.

As far as Vajrayāna goes, there was never a time that Dzogchen existed apart from the context of Vajrayāna. Thus his thesis that various teachers adulterated some imaginary "pure" Dzogchen with "lower" vehicles is a mistaken view.

The sūtra division of the Mahāyāna canon has several distinct divisions: Prajñāpāramita (which consists of many many volumes); the Avatamska Sūtra (in four volumes I think); the Ratnakuta collection (in several volumes with many scores of individual sūtras) and the general sūtra division which again is composed of many volumes. And this is just a rough overview of the Tibetan Mahāyāna canon. The Chinese Mahāyāna canon is just as vast.

The text translated in this volume is an inspired translation of one of the classics of the Great Perfection, unveiling the extraordinary tradition of the 8th century pandit Vimalamitra. It introduces the reader to the secret visionary instructions of Thögal practice, the core of Dzogchen itself. Extensively based on the corpus of the Seventeen Tantras, the text reveals the entire Path of the Great Perfection in a fluid and inspiring style which carefully follows the original.

One mustn't mix the views of sūtra and tantra. Whatever luminosity means in sūtra, it means something somewhat different in tantra, and something else again in Dzogchen. It is important not to mix these distinctions up. 

The tantric usage may overlap with the sūtra usage, and the Dzogchen usage may overlap with the tantra usage, but the reverse is not necessarily the case. In other words, the term becomes progressively multivalent up the scale.

I started out a thelemite. Then I understood that Vajrayāna was a nontheistic magickal path. But not only that, I understood that is was actually the swiftest path to liberation. Vajrayāna, and Dzogchen in particular, eclipse the WET tradition in so many ways. But you will only discover that by setting down that path yourself without hesitation or doubt.

That is one of the five, Nature Samantabhadra. With all due respect to ChNN, he does not teach all that there is to know of Dzogchen teachings, because in fact there is too much to learn, and he is focused on what is practical for people who will never learn Tibetan nor read the vast literature of Dzogchen teachings in his lifetime. 

Further, there is an account of the liberation of Samantabhadra and the delusion of sentient beings. This is not inconsistent with ChNN's observation you bring up. 

All phenomena should be understood as the nature of the five Samantabhadras. If it is asked what they are, it is as follows: Original Nature Samantabhadra, Ornament Samantabhadra, Teacher Samantabhadra, Vidyā Samantabhadra and Realization Samantabhadra.

Well, no, the purges of Stalin, the cultural revolution of Mao, the killing fields of Cambodia, were all essentially born out of an impulse to cultural suicide which was the legacy of centuries of enduring despotic rulers — communism was the excuse, not the cause. It would have happened anyway, whether under a nominally right or left wing regime. 

The war in Vietnam was a proxy war, as was the Cuban crisis, and we should have handled things there very differently. 

The reason many find the Nazi regime more horrifying is because it was so clearly based on the irrationality of hatred for others. 

But in fact, the structure of totalitarian states, whether right or left, are identical. They all rely on a tripod of the military, a civil police force, and a powerful extra-judicial secret police (KGB, Stazi, Gestapo, etc.) who keep watch on the other two.

They all are or should be equally horrific to everyone.

Friend Nick (we have after all been conversing for years), let me put it to you plainly. 

The greatest threat to humanity today is nuclear conflict. We live in a world where no form of government nor regime can keep us safe from the threat of a nuclear holocaust. And in fact, all indications are that we are falling headlong in that kind of conflict, with very few barriers —whether social, political, economic, or military — which seem to be able to withstand it. Thus far, it is only by the amazing self-discipline on the part of all our respective militaries regardless of political system or ideology that we have not actually blown ourselves into oblivion already. We should in fact be amazed we still exist given how easily we can destroy ourselves if just a few conditions are not met or backfire. 

So the real question is: how do we prevent humanity's utter self-destruction? This is really the only salient question we should have in our minds in any discussion of post Hiroshima world politics. 

In reality, the only acceptable alternative—since all others merely lead to the endless conflict of war and its miseries —is the complete and utter disarmament of humanity. This is the only sane path forward.

Marx himself termed Capitalism "progressive," a necessary phase in human history. Marx's specific theory was that the Socialist phase in human history could only happen after the world economy had been completely industrialized under advanced Capitalism. Lenin decided this was not necessary, that one only needed proletariat elites, and that this was sufficient for revolution. 

Frankly, Marx really had no idea what advanced Capitalism looked like. He further thought, inaccurately, that the revolution was going to happen in the US and Western Europe. Boy, was he ever mistaken about that. 

The brutalism you are referring to was a direct result of Lenin's jumping the gun and revising Marx's theory. 

Today, there are no more "Reds", other than in name only. Fascist Corporatism is winning largely because of neoliberalism. Nationalized socialisms such as Stalinism, Maoism, etc., were never going to win against international capital. 

As far as I cam concerned, Totalitarianism, whether right or left, "capitalist" or "socialist," needs to be resisted.

Saying something is nonfalsifible is not the same thing as saying something cannot be falsified. For example, where is Mt. Meru on planet Earth? 

If you claim that Meru is actually some structure out in space somewhere, where is it? Things that have been falsified in Meru Cosmology are such things as a geocentric orbit, a flat world and so on. 

When even the HH Dalai Lama has rhetorically requested Vasubandhu to rewrite the third chapter of the Abhidharmakośa, and masters like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu consistently poke fun at Tibetans who insist on adhering to this outmoded traditional belief, I find it amazing that obtuse westerners insist that literal adherence to this cosmology is somehow something of great value. 

If you really believe that the only thing preventing us all from being suffocated by the lethal fumes of the border hells is the ring of iron mountains around the four continents and Meru, honestly I feel a little sorry for you.

I can't speak to what other translators do or don't do. And of course more than one scholar has taken issue with Dowman's translations, the same applies to Tony Duff, etc. But that is not very important. Why? We would be very foolish to think that after translating Dharma texts into English for a generation that we are in any position to stake out definite positions about how things could or should be translated into English. 

For example, someone brought up the example of "stong pa nyid" as a translation for śūnyatā. Śūnyatā was originally translated into Tibetan as "ye 'byams." Very few people are aware of this, and so we run into rather strange translations of the term, not realizing it translated śūnyatā. So what to do? Do we translate it as "having always been without limitations?," "having always overflowed?," two quite literal translations of the term? Or do we use the very loose approximation "timeless infinity," as one translator suggests? Or do we translate it as emptiness, as we generally translate stong pa nyid? 

Someone else mentioned committee translations. In my opinion, the quality of a translations depends on the committee, who did the original, who edited it, and so on. The failure of translation committees is the desire to create a brand, like different models of cars. Different translations from the same committee exhibit different levels of accuracy and quality depending on the composition of the actual team. Even among Tibetans, those who are educated in Shedras may not actually have the knowledge of Dzogchen for example, to accurately give information when questioned about the usage of term such as la zla ba. 

The quality of a translation also depends very much on the ability of a person to express themselves well in their native tongue. Poor writers make poor translations. There are other factors: are you a native English speaker? Even the best of the non-native translators, not just Guenther, quite often make choices which are quite frankly nonidiomatic English and are strange in our language. Do you speak British, American, Canadian, Australian or Indian English? One's choice of words, one's compositional style, and so on, will all very much be influenced by the country and education one has.  

Than there are other factors: people who have never translated anything other than Dharma texts tend to have a very brittle and dry style, because Dharma texts from the traditions of Madhyamaka and so on are exactly that, dry and brittle taxonomies which give very little indication of or possibility for process. 

For myself personally, studying Tibetan Medicine opened up a whole new way of looking at Tibetan to which I previously had been blind. Biographies too demand a somewhat more personable style. In general, one modern fault of we Tibetan translators is a lack of diversity in our reading. I know of professors, much hailed for their translation of philosophical texts, who cannot handle that most simplistic of formats, the sadhana, with any skill at all. I have watched famous translators badly botch explanations given by Lamas because the translator had no knowledge of Tibetan Medicine and was therefore unable to accurately translate some concepts from a Dzogchen text, and amazingly just make up some bullshit on the spot, apparently to cover up their own ignorance. That said, I also have sympathy for oral translators, it is no easy job. Oral translators usually are not such good text translators, and the reverse is also true. There are very few translators who excel at both. As an oral translator, for example, I suck. 

Then there is the issue of "helping" the text. It is the habit of some translators to embed their understanding in their translations by fleshing them out, sometimes by as much as 40 percent, with extraneous material either derived from commentaries or from information provided in the course of hearing a text being taught. Other translations are leaner, more austere, tending to stick more closely to the text, depending on the reader's familiarity with the subject. Is this good, bad? How can we say it is either, when Tibetan translators themselves have often embellished?

If anything, translators of texts should find themselves humbled by the process. There is little glory in it. The translation process is driven by a passion for discovering the unknown, the unread. Principally, Dharma translation should be driven by the motivation to deepen one's own practice, and to aid others. It can be especially disheartening in the beginning because you are mostly wrong all the time; but of course in the end, when one can share texts that have never been seen in English, it is deeply rewarding because of the joy it brings to oneself through deeper understanding and the joy it brings to others because it is like giving the blind eyes to see, however imperfect those eyes may be and still in need of correction. 

While I certainly admit to having my preferences in both translation terms as well as translators, in general we should try to be supportive of the efforts of translators and not give them too hard a time. This does not mean that people cannot discuss this or that term and its suitability. Most people do not realize that a majority of texts translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan, especially the more important texts, underwent multiple revisions, a process that began in the mid-8th century and ended only in the 14th century. There exist dictionaries of archaic terms and their modern (i.e. post-Ralpacan) equivalents. Translators themselves should do their own research and not depend so heavily on translations made two, three, four, and five decades ago. Translators must question why for example we are translating ye shes as "primordial wisdom," rig pa as awareness, etc. We must not fall into formulaic translations, because in the end we will wind up with the very clumsy, basically unreadable translations done by Tibetans after the 14th century. 

I would only caution those translators who are much given to criticizing the work of others that such criticism merely opens the door for rebuttal and criticism in turn, and this helps no one in the end. People may wish to ignore this fact, but translation is a crowd-sourced process. The more eyes there are on our translations, the more accurate they can in time become.

I am sharing these thoughts with you because the question arose and because I have spent the last 24 years of my life obeying my guru, Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje's command that I become a translator. In that time I have translated many texts, made even more mistakes, and have had my own pride and arrogance knocked down again and again (as hard as it may seem for some of you to believe) by the process of translation. 

I will share with you one of my guiding principles in translating Dzogchen texts into English, since that is really what this thread is about. Rongzom states that while the words of the Great Perfection are simple, their meaning is vast and deep like space. On the other hand, the words of the lower vehicles are are very precise and detailed in their complexity, but their meaning is rough, just like a pile of dust. Therefore, as much as possible, when translating the texts of the Great Perfection, I try to keep my English as simple and plain as I can. 

However there are some other principles that I also observe summarized here: http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/poundtra.htm, and based on the work of Ezra Pound. 

1) A true translation must reject "Wardour-Street English," the pseudo-archaic language of Victorian translators associated with William Morris and F. W. Newman.  Pound was willing to experiment with a variety of poetic style and diction.  He made free-verse translations of classical works acceptable.

2) Each translation is a kind of criticism of the original.  It stresses the strengths of the original, but it also shows what its limits may have been.

3) No translation has to reproduce all aspects of the original.  It can choose to concentrate on only some aspects.  It can leave part of the original out.  It may even add to it or rearrange it in order to accomplish the translator's purpose.

4) Modern topical allusions may be used to bring across the emotions associated with the original's allusions.

5) Translations should be new poems in their own right.  They should be artistically well-done. (while this refers to poems, it applies to everything)

6) History is a product of the present.  All knowledge of the past is experienced in our current reception and reading of it.  In this sense, all translation is both a continuity and a re-reading of past texts and authors.

One may find much food for thought on this Wiki page too:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation

Finally, another point that many people don't understand. Poetry and Prosody (Kavya) are distinct from the style of Karika literature of Indo-Tibetan religio-philosophical texts. Texts from the Samcayagathas to the Precious Treasury of the Dharmadhātu are not poetry, nor are they intended as poetry. The so called "verse" portions of the tantras emulate the gathas of sūtra, and so too are not poetry, but are in metered verses to aid memorization. While such compositions can be "poetic," it must be firmly understood they are not poems in our sense of the word. True poetry in the Indo-Tibetan traditions is a very specific, very highly stylized form which is generally confined to the so called "verses of praise" and the dedications found in the beginning and end of texts, ranging from short texts to multivolume treatises, and whose complexity and depth depends very much on the education of the author. Real poetry in Tibetan can be pretty boring reading, depending on deep familiarity with the synonyms which may be found in the compendium Amarakośa and its commentary. For example, a common synonym for the sun is "The one who is drawn by seven horses."

So, in the end, it is better to be light-handed in our criticisms of translators and their translations unless they are engaged in gross fabrications or outright plagiarism.

You can look at it like that, if you choose. 

From the perspective of Buddhadharma, on the other hand, you are subject to rebirth whether you choose to accept this fact or not. And guess what, that is not a falsifiable statement. But rebirth is the fundamental problem Buddha provided a solution for. It is up to you to accept this or not, but no one can prove rebirth to you. It can easily be shown however that whatever "therapies" the Buddha devised, they were devised to cure this problem, i.e., rebirth.

Buddhadharma sets out a very specific set of problems, and proposes solutions to the problems it identifies. If one does not accept the problem Buddhadharma identifies (rebirth in samsara), there is no point is following its methodology.

Most importantly, it is the precursor to Longchenpa's Tshig don mdzod, and is the text that Longchenpa had in front of him when he wrote the latter. Longchenpa lifts entire passages from this text. Secondly, it contains, I believe, the first translation of an extensive analysis of the opening scenes of the Dzogcnen tantras, the nidāna section. Third, it is a quarter of the length of the Tshig don mdzod, making it a more manageable text, since it has many less citations. It gives context to Longchenpa's own works and thought on Dzogchen man ngag sde. It is a major text of the Northern Treasures tradition. Finally, it has my introduction where I detail my thoughts on Dzogchen terminology and view.

As a moral and aesthetic cosmolgy, not literally.

The biographies of Nāgārjuna are fanciful hagiographies (and you are only referring to Tibetan hagiographies, to the exclusion of earlier Chinese ones) written many centuries after his death. They are statements of faith, not statements of fact. In fact we know very little about Nāgārjuna as a person. Traditional sources frequently conflate Nāgārjuna of the MMK with later persons of the same name. But really, we don't need to know much about Nāgārjuna of the MMK as a person. His enduring legacy is found in the collection of reasoning and the collection of praises (excluding the Dharmadhātustava, which is clearly much later).

Of course I accept that there are many worlds and universes, all formed out of the karma of sentient beings. 

What I do not accept is that medieval Indian representations of Terra Firma ever depicted our own planet with as much accuracy as we have today. 

There are so many inconsistencies: for example, the sun rises because it comes from behind Meru, and the moon sets because it moves behind Meru. But the reality is that even Indian astronomical math, concurrent with Vasubandhu, for example, excludes the possibility of Mt. Meru, which is why Hindus commonly located Meru at the poles (of course they never visited the poles, so they were speculating). 

So just accept Meri cosmology for what it is a) an inaccurate representation of our world, an axial cosmology meant to describe the relative location of beings above and below the plane of the ground, according to their merit and leave it at that. Meru Cosmology cannot be taken literally, or conventionally. It is a best a moral metaphor.

Why should we bother? Meru Cosmology is useful for mandala offerings, but it is an ancient interpretation of our world, and it does not need to be the same world that actually formed out of the karma of ordinary sentient beings. 

The material of the Meru Cosmology which we offer in mandala offerings is something that we imagine is formed out of our body, enjoyments and the merit we have accumulated throughout the three times, its essence being inseparable bliss and emptiness.

It is quite possible Nāgārjuna went to Africa (the western continent), though unlikely, given that he lived in South-East India, in the Andhra region. The basis for the Meru cosmology is this planet, merely represented inaccurately in the imagination of some medieval Indians who did not have as accurate a geographical understanding of this world as we do today. 

For example, both Ptolemy and Vasubandhu talk about the Kurus (Scythians), but by Vasubandhu's time (a good 6 centuries after Ptolemy's time, long after the Scythians had vanished as a people), the account of the Central Asian steppes and their peoples were so garbled in the imagination of some Indians, they wrote down all kinds of fabulous exaggerations about the Earth that we see in chapter three of the Kosha. 

For example, many people make the mistake of thinking that Jambudvipa is the whole planet earth, when its descriptions clearly indicate that it is only a description of the subcontinent of India.

Anyway, it is pretty clear that Meru Cosmology is a descendent of Babylonian cosmology, shifted to India.

You are confusing emptiness with dependent origination. Emptiness is a negation, but dependent origination is a statement on how conditiond things function, i.e things do not arise from themselves, from other, from both or without a cause.

You are also making the mistaken argument that views cannot be antidotal, that they are invariably pathological. Thus, Candrakirti states that right view, emptiness, is the antidote for wrong views.

I think you are getting a little too carried away with your anti-view view.

But it clearly is a view: "Where this arises, that arose; with the arising that, this arose; where cease ceases, that ceases; with the cessation of that, this ceases."

How does dependent origination function? It functions because entities are empty of existence and nonexistence. That emptiness is what is not to be taken as a view. But dependent origination is acceptable as a view. Why? This is the question you need to ask yourself. If Buddha taught no views at all, then there is no need for Dharma, a path, nor could there be a result.

Zhangton makes it very clear that prior to him the utterly secret cycle was not promulgated prior to his revelation.  By this I understand his termas specifically to be the Golden Letters, Copper Letters, Agate Letters, Conch letters and Turquoise letters cycles, based on the index to the collection. 

However, there are some texts which may have been bundled together with his termas, such as the four empowerments authored by Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, the Seventy-Four Fragments (which are a terma attributed to Chetsun), the Soaring Garuda of Śrī Simha, the so called Sems dmigs drug of Vimalamitra, The Seven-fold Trekchö, and so on which are included. However, some of these aforementioned texts are also found separately from the Volumes of the Vima Nyinthig. Thus, strictly speaking, for various reasons I consider the Vima Snyinthig to be comprised of the Golden Letters, Copper Letters, Agate Letters, Conch letters and Turquoise letters cycles, and therefore the termas of Zhangton.

As long as we understand, as I pointed out at the very beginning here, that "all views" simply means views of existence and nonexistence. 


Is it possible to express anything concerning this truth? Perhaps this:

"There is no distinction whatsoever between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.
There is no distinction whatsoever between nirvāṇa and saṃsāra."
MMK 25.19

Or perhaps more apt:

This pair, samsara and nirvana, do not exist. 
However thorough knowledge of samsara is nirvana. 

But of course, all of this concerns the objective state of phenomena, and not how we subjectively experience the path and its realization.

Chetsun was the teacher of Chegom Nagpo. Chegom Nagpo was the teacher of Zhangton. Zhangton spent one year with Chegom when he was eleven. His bio says:

...when he arrived, he met Guru Chegom Nagpo, Having pleased the guru, the latter said “Since this one is the arrival of an emanation of a buddha, you should give this one to me” and Tashi Dorje remained in his presence for one year. 


As Zhangton says:


As such, thirty years later, having gone to the place where Chetsun disappeared, Chegom Nagpo of mNar mDa’ in Rong took out the outer, inner and secret oral lineage and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from himself. These then spread widely in dBus and gTsang. Fifty years after the revelation by Chegom Nagpo, I [Tashi Dorje] removed these unsurpassed secret cycles and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from myself.

After he left Chegom, he studied with 13 masters, and learned all Dharma topics, including secret mantra. 

Zhangton Tashi Dorje was 18 when he revealed the Vima Nyinthig — this was eighty years after Chetsun took rainbow body. However, in Zhang's bio, after he revealed the Vima Nyinthig, it says:

Then, when he returned to gTsang, because he went up from Shangs and rTa nag, after he met with the siddha Senge Wangchuk on a bridge, he [Tashi Dorje] confirmed the ultimate three kāyas were inseparable, and having granted permission for the Dharma, [Senge Wangchuk] left and disappeared. 

So basically, Zhangton received an entrustment of the teachings from Chetsun Senge Wangchuk in a vision. But they never met as two physical human beings. The relative connection between them was Chegom Nagpo. 

BTW, these texts are directly from the Vima Nyinthig. This information was going to be part of my intro, but it was becoming too long. I have a book of Vima Nyinthig material, I will probably included it there. The later bios that state that Chetsun was the guru of Zhangton are not very precise. But the autobiography and the bios in the Vima Nyinthik itself are very precise and explain the situation very thoroughly. Not only did Zhangton have a visionary encounter with Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, he later had a visionary encounter with Vimalamitra:

After that, at one time when he [Tashi Dorje]  was invited to mTshur khungs by Loppon Nyergom. In the pre-dawn, when doing a ganacakra, he met Vimala, was blessed and granted permissions. [Vimala] left into the sky and disappeared. At that time Tashi Dorje was sixty-one years of age.

It is strongly implied by these two passage:


Those who do not know the 
the division of the two truths,
do not know the profound principle of 
the Buddha's teaching. 

Without depending on convention,
one cannot explain the ultimate meaning.
Without realizing the ultimate meaning, 
nirvana cannot be attained.

In the second passage above, the first two lines explain the nominal ultimate; the second two lines explain the ultimate of realization. 

In the next passage he warns against leaving the explanation of the ultimate truth (emptiness) as an intellectual theory:

When emptiness is seen incorrectly, 
those of little wisdom are destroyed,
like one who handles a snake incorrectly,
or practices a vidyāmantra incorrectly.

There are two kinds of ultimate truths. Nominal 'emptiness' is a nominal ultimate truth, which refers to the absence of extremes in all phenomena, hence, 'emptiness' is in fact a conventional view. Nominal "emptiness" is not the non-enumerated ultimate truth, which is inexpressible.

Well, there is the fact that Zhangton says so:

As such, thirty years later, having gone to the place where lCe bTsun disappeared lCe sGom Nag po of mNar mDa’ in Rong took out the outer, inner and secret oral lineage and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from himself. These then spread widely in dBus and gTsang. Fifty years after the revelation by lCe sGom, I removed these unsurpassed secret cycles and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from myself. 



And his biography states:

After that, when he was living in the region of Sna khu in upper Nyang, before dawn there was a loud noise. Having arisen, he looked and in the sky there were rainbows, whorls of shimmering light, ḍākā and ḍākinīs, Mahākarunika, Tārā and the gurus of the past giving a prediction, “Listen! Amazing! The intimate instruction of buddhahood in a single life, the Dzogchen unsurpassed secret cycle is in a cliff that resembles a lion. The removal of that will have countless benefits for sentient beings.  The Dharma that is enough to meet is amazing, just amazing!” and then they disappeared. 

It is said that when he was eighteen years, Tashi Dorje did not understand the prediction. That evening, after thinking it over, a man wearing a white hat said to Tashi Dorje, “You will be given siddhi, go!”. 

That morning before dawn, [the man wearing a white hat] said “Go!”

Having left, that evening he arrived at Tsha ba Nyi ma mdar in lower Nyang. There were a group of many monks wearing yellow. Having sat, since he was given much food and drink, he wondered “That year there was a great famine. Should those be called siddhis?” 

Again at dawn [the man wearing a white hat] said “Go!”

Those monks were drinking a lot of alcohol, and having many dharma conversations, and it is said that they were content in prajñā, hearing and contemplation. 

Then, at noon he arrived somewhere, but he did not recognize the path. Again, he was guided by an upāsaka with a white hat. In the evening he arrived at sTag thabs, and just as he was lying down in an empty house, [the man wearing a white hat] said “Do not stay here, leave now!” and as soon as Tashi Dorje left the door, the house collapsed. 

That evening, a great rain occurred, and so that night he stayed under an overhanging cliff. The [the man wearing a white hat] emanation brought a lot of food and drink. 

Then, having crossed Rva lag tshugs, though there was a disturbance in the lower end of ‘O yug, since the emanation was fearless, on the day he reached “O yug, Tashi Dorje was extremely hungry and was given food by all the ladies who were cutting wood. Then he left and arrived at the base of a cliff that resembled a lion. After he became lost, he could not find it. He looked everywhere, but could not find it. He stayed because he could not return. Since he looked in the index, from the door where good grass was growing, in his hand he had a sharp weapon. Because he struck that [grass], the inside was revealed. Since he went inside, after sunrise he stayed in the center of a mandala. Since he dug with the sharp weapon, there was a mass of snakes and frogs all together. Having gradually cleared them away, he emerged above, and looked around, thinking in in his mind “Dharma is my expertise. If there is wealth, I will be happy.” Then, after producing one hundred and eight indexes, he danced from great joy. 

After that, he wrapped them all with a leather cord, and he looked in the cave of the valley. He could not see anything after dusk. At that time, again the upasaka brought light, food and drink and as soon as he looked at the books, the sound of a very terrifying voice arose in front of the door. “He is the emanation predicted for this, but older sister does not know him” and “I will and bring older sister.”
After that, at certain times, there were very terrifying voices, thinking that the cave was going to collapse, since his eyes fluttered, in front of the cave there was an an extremely terrifying eye the size of a skillet, a mouth of boiling blood, baring a single fang, of which he was frightened. He wondered why he was encountering this? 

Again, as in the prediction above, since he was not known by the older sister, she said:

I am Ekajati.
Offer one hundred and eight ganapujas.
Explain nothing for three years. 

Then she departed. That upāsaka with the white hat was Upāska Vajrasadhu. 

He blocked the entrance of the cave. Since there was a small piece of turquoise, with one man he offered cow meat and three bushels of barely for one hundred and eight feasts. 

In Nyang rTag rJed, he was greatly served by a faithful  benefactress named Shag mo dKar mTsho, and he was able to write down the books completely. 

This is why I think so.

Amazingly, Zhangton Tashi Dorje is always over looked in the lists of tertons, because for some strange reason, the Vima Nyinthig is never considered terma, though it is in fact.

I did not claim that my friend, you did. I said at the outset that the "views" Nāgārjuna was critiquing were views of existence and nonexistence. If you respond, this is not all he was critiquing, that he was critiquing the four extremes, the second two extremes are merely repetitions of the first two: i.e., to say that something both exists and does not exits, is just a view of existence. To say that something neither exists nor does not exist, is just a view of nonexistence. 

In the end, Nāgārjuna was aiming at views of permanence and annihilation, existence or nonexistence, which is why the only sūtra he cites in the whole MMK is the Inquiry of Kaśyapa. When the Buddha made such an argument against "yasti" and "nasti," he did so with respect to how things exist objectively. Thus it is entirely accurate to state that Madhyamaka is the study of the objective state of reality, whether or not there is such an objective state, a reality, and so on, or not.

We also need to bear in mind that we are, as a society, a great deal more literate than societies were 1000 years ago in general. As such, while our modernism may give rise to a certain level of conceptual complexity which can be a obstacle for sure, on the other hand, the learning curve is lower since literacy is not a barrier at all. If literacy forms a barrier, it is because we are very conditioned by our world view, and it then becomes very hard to overcome our education in science and so on.
