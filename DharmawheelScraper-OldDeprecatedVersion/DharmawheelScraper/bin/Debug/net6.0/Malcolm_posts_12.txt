Which logic are you referring to? The caturskoti? This is the most misunderstood idea in all of Buddhism. 

Taken at face value, it makes no sense in formal logic. Gee, maybe it is not meant to be a logical proposition. Maybe, just maybe, the fourfold negation by Nāgārjuna actually represent positions his contemporaries held. 

There are four possible states proposed in Ancient India for any given thing. It exists. It does not exist. It both exists and does not exist. It neither exists nor does not exist. Nāgārjuna, etc., are refuting these four possibilities because they contradict dependent origination. 

Likewise, Dzogchen "logic" similarly does not really depart from Nāgārjuna in this case. Dzogchen negates the positions of others without advancing its own position. Dzogchen, like "Prasangika," has no position of its own.

As Rongzom points out, Dzogchen cannot be negated through logic, nor can it be proven through logic.

Many Buddhists who take a pro-life argument adopt Christian talking points and buy into the narrative proposed by a non-Buddhist religious group. All they can do is point to prohibitions against abortion in the Vinaya. 

But all this is irrelevant to the womens reproductive rights issue at hand. The former is a religious issue. The latter is a secular issue. I personally favor keeping religion and the state completely and totally separate. I am complete opposed to legislating any religious view point into law.

It is not deterministic, but if the being has the karma to be born into a cakravartin family, they will never be born in a family of farmers, and vice versa. This is based on their own actions in past lives. 

Further, if a being has the throwing karma to be reborn in the human realm, they will not be reborn elsewhere, even if aborted, because a fetus cannot create new karma which would interfere with a human rebirth, and the throwing karma will still be active.

For this reason, Buddhists should not get all worked up about abortion the way Christians do, because we accept rebirth and karma, and they do not. They use language like "a new life," "innocence," etc., because they have a one and done view of birth. One is only born once, with a soul given to one by God, and when one dies one ultimately goes either to heaven or hell forever.

Yes, suffering is perpetuated through rebirths, the cause of suffering (vipaka) is karma, and the cause of karma is affliction. However, if a sentient being has activated the traces of affliction to be reborn in the human realm, they will be reborn a human being, if they do not, then they cannot ever be born a human being until they activate those traces. 

As long as there is birth in the three realms, there is suffering. This is axiomatic in Buddhadharma.

Also, the Buddha was quite clear that phenomena, including minds, were momentary. The Buddha may not have elaborated in detail upon what a "moment" was, but in the end, the basic unit of time in Buddhism is number of moments it takes to form a thought. In reality, moments are partless. Partless moments that perish as soon as they arise have no observable duration and are immune from Madhyamaka critique. 

The notion that the mind is permanent (i.e. not momentary) is just a Hindu idea, Vedantic.

Poetic license. If you read her biography (mentioned above), you will see she received her name and made her aspiration to never take male form eons ago, you will see her association with Tathāgatas Amoghasiddhi and Akṣobhya, her identification with Prajñāpāramita, her relationship with Avalokiteśvara, and her role in Śakyamuni Buddha's awakening, and so on. 

Tāra is a complex figure, and cannot be reduced to an accouterment of a male bodhisattva's compassion.

"Devi" does not necessarily imply she is a goddess of the desire or form realm. Tārā was a princess, and the term devi is also used for princesses, just as the term devaputra is used for princes.

This is from the praise to 21 Tārās, so not a Tibetan elaboration at all. 

As for her biography, for example, Tārānātha's famous Golden Rosary (See, Wilson, In Praise of Tārā,1996), there is no contradiction between the Princess Candrajñānā  having first wakened her bodhicitta under the Tathāgata Dundubhisvara, receiving the name Tārādevi, and vowing to attain buddhahood in female form and her later association with Avalokiteśvara.

They follow the vows and conduct of a śrāmaṇera, and yes they can teach, etc. The difference between "the laity" (not really an appropriate term for upāsakas) and śrāmaṇeras is the difference of vows. The Buddha's original monastic sangha had no rules. Then eventually, there were 200+, and a common joke in Tibetan circles is that if the Buddha had lived to 100 there would have been more than 500, because most of the rules were implemented because lay people complained about the behavior of this or that monk, etc.

Life, personhood, pleasure and pain
 — This is all that's bound together
In a single mental event
 — A moment that quickly takes place.

Even the spirits who endure
For eighty-four thousand aeons
 — Even these do not live the same
For any two moments of mind.

What ceases for one who is dead,
Or for one who's still standing here,
Are all just the same aggregates
 — Gone, never to connect again.

The states which are vanishing now,
And those which will vanish some day,
Have characteristics no different
Than those which have vanished before.

With no production there's no birth;
With becoming present, one lives.
When grasped with the highest meaning,
The world is dead when the mind stops.

There's no hoarding what has vanished,
No piling up for the future;
Those who have been born are standing
Like a seed upon a needle.

The vanishing of all these states
That have become is not welcome,
Though dissolving phenomena stand
Uncombined from primordial time.

From the unseen, [states] come and go,
Glimpsed only as they're passing by;
Like lightning flashing in the sky
 — They arise and then pass away.

This term, chos/bka' rtags kyi phyag rgya bzhi, the seal of the four characteristics of the Dharma appears to have entered Tibet in the 11th century. It is a late Mahāyāna term for what constitutes the śrāvakayāna basic criteria for authenticating the Buddhist teachings. They are explained as seals because these four features are held to be like the seal or decree which a minister uses to invoke the authority of the king. This term is found in native Tibetan texts as early as the 12th century, and probably earlier. 

The formula, "all compounded phenomena...nirvana is peace" is found in Sthiramati's commentary on the Mahāyānasūtralaṃkara, which was translated in either the 11th century by an obscure translator named Che Tashi (Lce bkra shi) with an Indian.

It has to do with the fact that each level of vow has its own rite of bestowal; its own set of vows; its own method of maintaining those vows; and its own method of repairing those vows if they are broken. 

Pratimokṣa vows, the vows of personal liberation come from the śrāvaka schools and are detailed in Vinaya. The Tibetans follow the Mulasarvastivadins; Buddhists in Shri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos follow the Theravada. East Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, follow the Dharmaguptaka sect. 

Then we have the bodhisattva vows. In the Tibean tradition there are two main traditions: Madhyamaka and Yogacāra. They are not different in meaning, but they are different in method of bestowal and the number of vows, etc. one is expected to follow. In China and Japan, the bodhisattva vows are derived from a sūtra that seems to not have an Indian source, the Brahamajala Sūtra. In the Theravada countries there is no rite at all for conferring bodhisattva vows. 

Finally, secret mantras vows come from receiving empowerments in the Yoga Tantra and Anuttarayoga tantra. 

So there are three kinds of vows, and they each have their own rite, and so on. This is why there is no "Vajrayāna" ordination per se. You should get Buddhist Ethics by Jamgon Kongtrul where the three vows are explained in detail.

No. Ordination, pravrajita, going forth, is strictly a śrāvakayāna rite. There are no Vajrayāna ordination rites. There are Vajrayāna monks because in addition to receiving monastic ordination, they also receive bodhisattva vows and secret mantra samayas, and the latter two sets of vows supersede the former monastic ordination. You've already received bodhisattva vows and samayas. So you are a Vajrayāna upāsika (lay person), since you receive pratimoṣka vows when you took refuge with Garchen Rinpoche.

Many of the terminological equivalents of Buddhist terms in use today were made by people who were not practitioners, who were philologist and linguists, who made their translations with old, nonspecialist dictionaries. Even dictionaries like Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit dictionary have many errors of understanding, it was after all first published in 1953. 

I understand this poses problems for people who do not have at their disposal a primary Buddhist language with which to investigate these issues, but as a practitioner-translator who is fluent in Tibetan and acquainted  with Sanskrit, I can assure you that the greater percentage of the translations of Buddhist texts made prior to 1990, whether out of Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, or Tibetan, made largely by people with no skin in the game other than an academic position, are riddled with errors practitioners would not make, like translating kṣaya as "destruction" rather than "exhaustion." Another example of a bogus translation is rendering dharmakāya as "Law Body" usually seen in East Asian translations prior to a certain period of time. But like New Age ideas, many bad translations of Buddhist terms never die, and get recycled again and again by people who, lacking education and expertise, cannot discern that they are erroneous.

There is no objective standard by which such attributions of realization can be measured. It's is all just hearsay. What you just engaged in was hearsay. In other words, you decided, based on criteria you are not sharing, that your teacher was a realized person (which you have not defined). Now, you have shared your opinion and I read that your statement. This is exactly what hearsay is. There is no proof, nor can there be. Thus, all such claims are rumor, etc, as I have mentioned. If I claim, for example, that my guru is a realized person, you have no way to check this and no reason to believe me.

Neither does picking only one teacher to work with. It is impossible for an ordinary person to judge the realization or lack thereof, of anyone else, let alone this or that given teacher. Even of one imagines one is picking a teacher who is equal in realization to the Buddha himself, this is only the opinion of an ordinary person and nothing more.  

People accept teachers entirely based on rumor, hearsay, fame, accolades, in other words, based on reputation alone. Confirmation bias is a strong factor here.

This is already pointed out in the Saddharmapundarika Sūtra, you should read it sometime:

“Noble ones, the world with its devas, humans, and asuras thinks and believes, ‘Bhagavān Śākyamuni departed from his Śākya clan into mendicancy, went to the preeminent, supreme Bodhimaṇḍa, and attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood by the city of Gayā.’ [F.118.b] However, noble ones, I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago.

And:

“Noble ones, the Tathāgata says to beings with various aspirations, few roots of merit, and many kleśas, ‘Bhikṣus, I am young; I renounced my family and it has not been long, bhikṣus, since I have attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.’

And:

“Noble ones, whatever the Tathāgata has to do, that is what the Tathāgata does. The Tathāgata, who has attained perfect buddhahood a long time ago, has an immeasurable lifespan. [F.120.a] He always remains and does not pass into nirvāṇa, but creates the appearance of passing into nirvāṇa in order to benefit his students.

And:

“Noble ones,” he continued, “in the same way, although I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood countless, innumerable hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago, I sometimes teach as a skillful method such as this in order to guide beings. In this matter, I am not in any way a liar.”

https://read.84000.co/translation/toh113.html

If you assert the Buddha experiences the sufferings and torments of ordinary sentient beings, you contradict your own basic sūtra. 

The twelve deeds are only for show. The future buddha, Maitreya, makes the same point of the Mahāyānottaratantra, citing the Lotus Sūtra to this effect.

At minimum, one holds the commitments of refuge and the vow against killing (which really refers to killing humans, but it widely interpreted to cover all creatures). 

This is complicated by taking bodhisattva vows. Since bodhisattva vows supersede pratimokṣa vows, whenever the former contradict the latter, the former should be followed and not the latter in order to avoid a bodhisattva downfall. The same applies to Vajrayāna vows. 

Buddhist Ethics by Kongtrul has the most detailed presentation.

Yes, correct. Dharma is concerned only with the cessation of suffering. 

The reason we practice ahimsa is not to preserve life, but rather, is not to consciously cause suffering. 

Anyway, one cannot abort life, one can only abort a life. But since there is rebirth, the loss of life does not mean that sentient being whose fetal development was interrupted will not take another rebirth. And, further, being aborted is a ripening of karma. In Buddhadharma, there are no innocents.

I am saying that the tathāgatgarbha sūtras can be understood to be definitive if they are correctly understood (tathātagarbha as the luminous, original nature of the mind), and if understood incorrectly, provisional in meaning at best (and at worst, an atmanavāda). As they stand, tathāgatgarbha sūtras require interpretation, unlike Madhyamaka and the PP Sūtras. 

I am saying that the Lanka and Candrakīrti offer the final word on the subject. The Uttaratantra itself defines tathāgatagarbha as a provisional teaching, in the chapter one, the fourth vajra topic, towards the end, verses 156-160:

Having stated that all knowable things are empty in every aspect, like clouds, dreams, and illusions,
here, the buddhas have stated that the buddha element (buddhadhātu) exists in all sentient beings. 
They have stated this for the purpose of having [sentient beings] abandon five faults: timidity, contempt for inferior sentient beings,
grasping the impure, deriding pure phenomena, and excess attachment to themselves.

While the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi) is devoid of all compounded aspects, 
the meaning of affliction, karma, and ripening are said to be like clouds, and so on. 
Afflictions are like clouds, karma is like an experience in a dream, 
and ripening of karma and afflictions, the aggregates, are like an illusory emanation. 

Having presented this above, this ancillary or supplemental tantra repeats 
the explanation "the dhātu exists" in order to abandon five faults.


The Uttaratantra's actual goal is to explicate luminosity aka clear light, and its realization.

This is definitely not so.  For example, Sapan, whom you mention above, considered only the Abhisamayālaṃkāra to be definitive. Also Tsongkhapa followed suit. 

For example, the Hevajra Tantra explicitly places Yogācara below Madhyamaka, and so on. 

First explain Vaibhāṣika,
likewise, Sautrantika,
after that, Yogācara, 
and likewise, Madhyamaka.

Also Sapan held the view that Uttaratantra itself viewed tathāgatagarbha as a provisional doctrine. Not only this, but the scholars of the Imperial Period held that Yogacāra was below Madhyamaka, since they were all students, directly or indirectly, of Santarakṣita.

The difference here of course is that in the citta in this case is actually different than the knower (jñā). The knower is termed puruśa, is a passive consumer, and is utterly different than praḳrti, which is where the transformations are occurring. The knower itself never changes, but merely witnesses the transformations of prakṛti. But none of this is what I am talking about. 

in Buddhism, it is axiomatically assumed that there are many independent mind streams; this is proven by Dharmakirti in Saṃtānāntarasiddhi, "Proof of Other's Minds."

The argument that a knower is a self has already been advanced and dismantled in Buddhist texts. If a knower can have many cognitions, it already has many parts and cannot be a unitary or an integral entity. We are therefore not operating here at a position prior to recognizing discrete entities, the very fact that our minds (citta) are variegated (citra) proves the mind is not an integral entity, proves it is made of parts, and since those cognitions happen sequentially, this proves the mind is also impermanent, momentary, and dependent. So, it is impossible for a conventional knower to be a self.

Things appear to be discrete, so we label them “discrete.” If things appear to be nondiscrete, we are not able to label them as discrete. For example, from a distance a mountain does not appear to be composed of discrete parts, so we label that appearance “mountain.” When we get closer, we see there are many parts, and what was formally labeled a mountain gets redefined into slopes, peaks, ravines, and so on. When we meet someone, we label that person a self, a person, a living being, but these labels attached to appearances will not bear analysis. It’s the same with mental continuum’s, even the notion of mental continuum will not bear ultimate analysis, but since the cause and result of karma, etc., appear to be discrete, mind streams are, conventionally speaking, discrete, because there is an observable function.. If we wish to aggregate minds, we refer to all consciousnesses as the dhatu of consciousness, just as we refer to aggregated elements as the space dhatu, etc.

Tibetan instruments are never mentioned in the tantras. So it does not matter which one you use.

But when it comes to vajras and bells, and vases, and so on, the production of all these things are very precisely described in lower tantras. 

As far as damarus are concerned, they are described in higher tantras. There are two kinds described therein: skull damarus and wood damarus. Generally, it is considered that wrathful rites require the former, while peaceful rites require the latter. 

Further, we should understand they are not appropriate to use in rites of the lower tantras, and only should be used in higher tantric rites. 

However, there are differences between different schools. Nyingmapas tend to favor skull damarus, Gelugpas wooden ones. Wooden damarus should be made out of sandalwood, red sandalwood, catechu wood, or other non-poisonous woods. There are also precise sizes described for damarus. 

As for the drum head, nothing other than skins are prescribed for either kind of damaru.

Merriam Webster is the preferred dictionary of editors in North America. In any case, your two definitions above support Merriam Webster's definition. 

It's just better to avoid the world "real" in Buddhist parlance. Anything that cannot bear analysis cannot be construed as real in any meaningful sense. Since not even nirvana or the three kāyas can withstand analysis, in the final analysis, Buddhism finds that everything is dependent on conditions, which are also unreal. Hence, everything is unreal, and not real. This is what it means to say everything is empty. To say something is not empty is to say that it is real; to say that something is empty is to say that it is not real.

The Teaching of Akṣayamati:

The sūtras that, with various words, proclaim a self, a being, a life principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, a personality, a human being, a man, a subject that acts, and a subject that feels and those that teach that there is a ruler where there is no ruler are called implicit. The sūtras that teach emptiness, the absence of distinguishing marks, the absence of anything to long for, the unconditioned, the unborn, the unoriginated, the nonexistent, the absence of self, the absence of being, the absence of soul, the absence of person, the absence of spirit, the absence of ruler, and the gates of liberation are called definitive. This is called the reliance on the sūtras of definitive meaning, not on the sūtras of implicit meaning.

Stupas are descendent from the royal funerary tumulus. There are canonical requirements surrounding the construction of such memorials. There are many considerations.

I didn't say that. 

I said I would not build a stupa unless I was reasonably certain it would not be desecrated and that I've been advised that building stupas on private property is fraught for that reason. 

As for your views, you were the person, I think, who attempted to distinguish yourself as an "ethnic" buddhist as opposed to us "converts." I object to the distinction, since I think it is invalid. You were also the person who brought in the notion of how being raised in family of Buddhists somehow imbued the air with a mysterious aroma that we converts would never know. I merely responded in kind. Most of the ethnic Buddhists I know don't know shit about Buddhism and don't behave like they do.

Not really. It is always better to err on the side of caution when embarking on building Buddhist monuments of any kind. I've seen more than one Buddhist community get into protracted legal battles over this stuff, especially when neighbors get wind of things like stupa constructions etc. Hell, your land might not even be zoned to allow such construction. Then, you have install a leach field, etc., get construction permits, etc. And that does not even take into consideration the idea of having your backyard stupa designated a landmark:

My comment was not directed towards resale value, but making sure the stupa is respected, not demolished, etc., after you sell. Most teachers I know discourage people from building stupas property that might in future be sold to non Buddhists.

More importantly, they focus on the commentarial Tradition of Nalanda, and when it comes to the words of the Buddha, spend most of their time on the exegesis of the various tantras that form the core of their curriculum, Guhyasamaja, Guhyagarbha, Hevajra, and Kalacakra.

To say that something in not acquired is to claim it is innate. To claim something is innate is to claim it is a nature. 

Bodhicitta is the desire to attain awakening. Mahāyāna bodhicitta is the desire to attain full buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Claiming that bodhicitta is innate or unacquired is a strange claim. This is not the same as the so-called prakṛtīgotra, natural disposition. Natural disposition means simply that we have a mind, and that mind can become inspired to desire awakening when it meets with proper conditions to develop Mahāyāna bodhicitta. But Mahāyāna bodhicitta is by no means innate, and neither is mahākaruna, the compassion which is absolutely free of reference points. A mother's compassion is very much a referential compassion.

Mahākaruna and bodhicitta are both acquired. How? Through training. If they were unacquired, as you claim, no training would be needed to develop them, but this is clear not the case.

The connection is made if the practitioner has the ability rest in rig pa. Otherwise, for the sentient being in question, there is no benefit. 

Meat, wool, leather, hooves, bones, etc., don’t suffer. So as long as there is no participation through killing, witnessing, etc., i.e., the meat is pure in three ways, there is no fault in eating it and so no misdeed.

I am not sure we can all the initial arhats were Mahāyāna bodhisattvas, but certainly Śariputra, Ananda, etc. were, according to Mahāyāna tradition. On the other hand, Śariputra is often set up to look like a dummy in many Mahāyāna sūtras.

We think that unlike Dechen Nyingpo, Sapan never opined that anyone was going to hell for having views with which he disagreed. Indeed, he invited open investigation of his critiques. 

Frankly, the Anti-Nyingma sentiments of Pabhongka and his circle of intimates is hardly news, being well documented and available for anyone to read who has an interest in history.

They engaged in the conduct of the bodhisattvas.

These arhats were all bodhisattva arhats, not shravaka arhats.

No, this is a mistaken view. If this were the case, the three incalculable eons necessary for buddhahood in sūtrayāna could bypassed by attaining arhatship. 

But it does not work like that. First, the emptiness realized by arhats is only the emptiness of the person, not of phenomena, and not of the emptiness of the four extremes. 

Gorampa Sonam Senge addresses all these issues in his Differentiation of Views. You can look there.

The teachings that were to be turned into Liberation in the Palm of One's Hand  were taught in 1921, nine years before the falling out between  the Great 13th and Pabhongkha. 

Funny, you severely critized terma and Dzogchen in another thread, but here you are relying on the authority of  the Great 13th to prop up Pabhongkha. Surely, you must know that the Great 13th not only was the main patron and student of Terton Sogyal, a.k.a Lerab Lingpa, but also a Dzogchen practitioner.

In any case, it must have dawned on you by now that most of the Tibetan Buddhists here are either Nyingma, Sakya, or Kagyu, and as such, whether you think it is fair or not, most of us consider Pabhongkha to be irredeemably sectarian. Therefore, we wouldn't touch a lineage coming through him with a ten foot pole.

The reason all these lineages run though him is that Pabhongkha was the principle guru of Ling Rinpoche and Trijiang Rinpoche, and they in turn were the principle gurus of a whole generation of Gelukpads in exile. But Ling Rinpoche never received this practice from Pabhongkha. There are lines of Gelugpa transmission in Amdo that do not run through Pabhongkha. The later Kirti Tsenshab never had any involvement with the Pabhongaka stream, as far as I understand things, etc.

If someone has received the Madhyamaka tradition of Bodhisattva vows, that is sufficient. There is no need to mix them with the Yogacara system. But of course, one can observe both traditions, since they are not in contradiction.

When practicing trekcho, one cannot find any phenomena to be exhausted. If one can find something to be exhausted, one is not practicing trekcho, and one will be unable to make any progress in thogal.

Trekcho is related to the basis. All phenomena have always been exhausted in the basis. For this reason, Trekcho starts with the exhaustion of dharmatā, since it is not related to appearances.

On the contrary, as Peter C correctly notes, centuries of Tibetan exegesis have merely mired the Indian treatises in layers of polemics which reflect Tibetan concerns, but which lead us astray from the original purposes of these compositions. It is for this reason, for example, that Khenpo Shenga, recognizing this issue, eschewed the study of Tibetan exegetes of the 13 great treatises, and prepared interlinear commentaries for them based on their authentic Indian commentaries. 

In any case, with rare exceptions, Tibetan scholastics has been largely moribund navel-gazing since 15th century. The last truly novel Tibetan exegete was Tsongkhapa. Even brilliant scholars like Mipham and Ganden Chophel are just raking over the coals of the 15th century Tibetan Renaissance. There has been nothing original at all in all four or five schools since that time, that is, until the recent encounter of Tibetan Buddhism with the West and a long overdue revival of serious Sanskrit studies amongst Tibetans. And even then, such studies generally exist among Tibetans to defend Dolbuwa, Gorampa, or Tsongkhapa's view—so, not even really original these days either. This state of affairs has resulted in a kind of intellectual paralysis among Western followers of Tibetan Buddhism, who generally decide they belong to a "school" and then defend that school, adopting scholastic positions they barely understand and are not really equipped to parse, at least, while they are beginners or are not equipped with language skills.
