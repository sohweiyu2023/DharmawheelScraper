The Precious Vase is about discovering our primordial state, the base, or basis. That’s why semzins abd rushans are discussed in it, as well as the essence of sems sde. The reality is that if one applies in a proper way the instructions in the Precious Vase, one doesn’t need to follow the rest of SMS.

It was not understood until 1933 that influenza was caused by a virus. Several vaccines were developed for influenza in 1918, but they all targeted the wrong pathogen, a bacteria, Bacillus influenzae.

Viruses were not really at all well understood until the 1920's, though they were discovered in 1892.

Generally, speaking, the main point of the CN is a guru yoga of Vimalamitra, and the main approach is guru yoga. 

Otherwise, in addition to the seven lojongs, it has refuge, bodhicitta, Vajrasattva, Mandala, and Guru Yoga. It also has anuyoga style creation and completion as well, in addition, it has rushen, trekcho, and thogal.

The Precious Vase is primarily a commentary on Rongzom's commentary on Padmasambhava's Rosary of Intimate Instructions. ChNN stated many times every one of his students should study the Precious Vase. Next, I suppose you are going to inform us that the level 1 SMS is for people who need "to do or leave something" too.

Well, that's true because of corporate socialism. The subsidies energy companies get to produce natural gas and oil are appalling:

Globally, fossil fuel subsidies are were $5.9 trillion or 6.8 percent of GDP in 2020 and are expected to increase to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2025 as the share of fuel consumption in emerging markets (where price gaps are generally larger) continues to climb. Just 8 percent of the 2020 subsidy reflects undercharging for supply costs (explicit subsidies) and 92 percent for undercharging for environmental costs and foregone consumption taxes (implicit subsidies).

https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies

2017 numbers for the US:


These were dominated by subsidies to fossil fuels, which account for around 70% (USD 447 billion) of the total. Subsidies to renewable power generation technologies account for around 20 % of total energy sector subsidies (USD 128 billion), biofuels for about 6 % (USD 38 billion) and nuclear for at least 3 % (USD 21 billion)...

Subsidies to petroleum products dominated the total, at USD 220 billion, followed by electricity-based support to fossil fuels at USD 128 billion. Subsidies to natural gas and coal in 2017 were estimated to be USD 82 billion and USD 17 billion, respectively.

https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Apr/IRENA_Energy_subsidies_2020.pdf

So basically, US subsidies are about 20 percent of the total global outlay of government subsidies for oil and gas. 

Then there agriculture subsidies. In 2021, the federal government provided farms with $28.5 billion in subsidies, or direct farm program payments. That, combined with exploitation of migrant labor, keeps our food cheap. 

So its socialism all the way down until you get to the consumer, then it is profit all the way up.

And were there more nuclear power plants, you would find higher numbers. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. 

For examnple, a 2010 study by the NAS was abandoned after it was deemed too expensive. 

https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/bg-analys-cancer-risk-study.html

However, there is this:

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ijc.31116

While the study does not show causation, it does show correlation. 

However, there some evidence of an uptick in thyroid cancer following Fukushima:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28954584/#:~:text=The%20large%2Dscale%20ultrasound%20screening,cohort%20of%20approximately%20300%2C000%20subjects.

Chernobyl cancer estimates:

You might consider these numbers less than compelling, given the number of deaths from burning hydrocarbons, one in five: 

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/news/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-responsible-for-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide/

But nuclear power plants are expensive: https://thebulletin.org/2019/06/why-nuclear-power-plants-cost-so-much-and-what-can-be-done-about-it/

https://www.vox.com/2016/2/29/11132930/nuclear-power-costs-us-france-korea

Wind and solar are much less expensive.
