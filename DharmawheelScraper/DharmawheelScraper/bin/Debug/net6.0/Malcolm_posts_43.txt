For example, we live now in an age where the life span for humans is considered to be a one hundred. This does not mean everyone lives to a hundred, or that one cannot live longer, etc.

More like 450 years from now, that is when the Kalacakra war is supposed to happen. But I don't think this idea is based at all on Kalacakra, but rather a prediction in the srga thal gyur tantra, where it says that Dzogchen teachings will continue to spread until the time when the lifespan decreases to ten years, at which point it will disappear. Given that the notion that the Śākyamuni's Dharma supposed to last 5000 years before it disappears and so on, we can see the inference that Dzogchen will be the last surviving system of Dharma.

The Tibetan calendar, while calculated astronomically on the basis of the Kālacakra (specifically the Vimalaprabha), is applied according to the system of 'byung rtsi, i.e. elemental calculation, which originates some time in the 11th century and derives from "China", roughly speaking. 

There are two main systems of calendar making in Tibet, Phuglug and Tshurlug; the former is followed by most Tibetans; the latter, by the Karma Kagyu. The Tshurlug new year is one month earlier than the Phuglug system.

Can you tell me which Tibetan word is used for "surrender"? I have never encountered it used in a Tibetan or Indian Dharma book and I have read thousands. 

I don't read basic Dharma texts in English very often anymore, though I do recall from when I did that Trungpa was definitely into the concept of surrender. I think those Tibetans like their Western students to "surrender"; but I think it has a bit more to do with the Cakravartin model of defeating and then converting people to the Dharma.

There is an idea of entrusting oneself (gtad pa) to the Three Jewels or the Guru, but that is a bit different in my view. 

For example, when I entrust my money to a bank for safe keeping I do not surrender to the banker. When I entrust myself to the Three Jewels or my guru for the shelter of refuge, I am not surrendering to them. When someone "surrenders" they are placing themselves at the mercy of another. That is not how I understand my relationship with the Three Jewels nor my Gurus —&nbsp;that is a despotic model, quite common in Christianity, Judaism and Islam, and perhaps even Hinduism, but I think it is pretty foreign to Buddhadharma, no matter what Tulku Urgyen and Tsoknyi Rinpoche translators may have said when translating for them.

In other words, Saraha was the person who first promulgated Cakrasamvara among humans in this epoch and so all lineages of Cakrasamvara practice must in some way or another trace their lineage to him directly or indirectly.

Is Buddhahood a state one realizes, or a phenomena one passively observes? If Buddhahood is something that already exists within a sentient being, there is no reason for the experience of samsara. The Uttaratantra is very profound, but understood incorrectly, it is results on one adopting a tīrthika view of atman. Viewed another way, it becomes a definitive teaching on the nature of reality. It really depends on how it is understood. 

Omniscience has causes and conditions. Even you admit it this in your example. Reality is already there, but unless one removes obscurations to perceiving it, it will never be perceived. Reality is not buddhahood. Buddhahood is the result of seeing reality fully.

Title: Re: Gradual vs. Nongradual

This false consequence is often bandied about, but it is not convincing. Why is this so? 

1) What is awakening? It is the direct perception of suchness, the dharmadhātu, etc. This is the direct cause of buddhahood. When that suchness is directly perceived (first bhumi, etc.), it is no longer possible to return to a state of ignorance about it just as a seed singed by fire can no longer produce a sprout. In other words, a consciousness singed by wisdom is no longer capable of giving rise to afflictive ignorance. The proximate or indirect causes of buddhahood are the trainings in the paths and stages. 

2) Second, the state of perfect buddhahood, unsurpassed perfect complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksambodhi) is itself defined through the eradication of the two obscurations: the afflictive obscuration and the knowledge obscuration. When these two are eradicated it is not possible for someone to possess them again. Even if their consciousness remains a relative conditioned entity, it is a pure relative conditioned entity characterized by unimpeded knowledge of unconditioned reality. The mind, a conditioned relative entity, does not disappear at buddhahood. If it did, that would be nihilism; nor does it turn into an unconditioned entity itself, because that would involve a contradiction in kind —&nbsp;a conditioned entity cannot become an unconditioned entity and vice versa — as well as eliminating the possibility that there is a continuum between a sentient being and Vajradhara. This is the reason that Sachen Kungpa Nyingpo states in his Nyagma when defining the alāya cause continuum:

"Tantra", because it is the garland of self-knowing from a sentient being through buddhahood, the uninterrupted awareness of the mind itself.

Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen further notes on this passage: 

Because all concepts and suffering are complete in the meaning of ālaya, it is the cause continuum.

The spiritual goal of Mahāyāna Buddhadharma is buddhahood, the attainment of the three kāyas. Bodhisattvas are those who strive for this goal in order to liberate all beings from samsara. In the process, all afflictions that cause rebirth in samsara are eliminated and power over birth is attained at the eighth bhumi. 

From the point of view of Buddhadharma, Advaitans never achieve cessation of rebirth because they do not eradicate the innate clinging to atman, therefore, no matter how profound their samadhi or understanding may be, it is not a cause of freedom from samsara, and at best they attain rebirth in the unconsciousness deva realms.

What you seem to be failing to understand is that if you have gone for refuge to the Buddha, you have eschewed other refuges. If you go for refuge to other gods having once gone for refuge to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, you void your refuge in the Three Jewels including losing all the vows that come with going for refuge, you return to the state of a ordinary person, and the virtue that you perform is no longer elevated by refuge in the Three Jewels. 

Buddhadharma is a path, and&nbsp;aside from the fact of whether the goals of Buddhadharma and Sanatana Dharma are the same(they're not),  one cannot tread two paths at the same time. One must walk on one or the other. One cannot walk on both. It would be very much like trying to stand on two horses at the same time.

A Mahāyānist in general should be consuming food with the motivation to achieve buddhahood for the benefit of sentient beings — so as long as that is the case, there is no problem with eating dinner, whether lay or ordained.

This would be the general Tibetan Buddhist viewpoint. The Bodhicaryāvatara states:

Those who wish to guard their discipline
must guard their minds strictly. 
If one does not guard the mind, 
one will not be able to fully guard one’s training. 
Drunk wild elephants
do not cause as much harm as
the harm of Avici caused
by the unrestrained elephant of the mind. 
If the elephant of the mind is always restrained
with the rope of mindfulness, 
all fears will not exist
and all virtue will come into one’s hand.

In his discussion of the pratimokṣa vows of Mahāyāna system, Sapan states:

Here, these observances that are concerned
with the elements of evil and unwholesomeness
are mostly kept as in the Disciple's system,
while certain desireless offenses are treated 
in accord with that of bodhisattvas.

Behavior that, in the view both systems,
would cause worldlings to lose faith
is strenuously guarded against; a lapse
is allowed in the Individual Liberation discipline
if the Great Vehicle if it induces worldings to virtue. 

-- Rhoton, 2002, SUNY, pg. 46. 

In other words, bhikṣus eating dinner is not an issue for a Tibetan Buddhist monastery. Handling gold and money is not an issue as long as it is for the benefit of the Dharma, so on and so forth.

In reality is does work out like that, if you happen to believe in karma. 

As far as lunch and dinner are concerned, since all Tibetan monks are Mahāyānists, Mahāyāna Bhikṣus needn't be so concerned with these details, since their motivation for practice is more important that adhering to this or that rule. Nevertheless, the act of receiving the three vows in itself is a virtue, and one should endeavor as best one can to uphold the three vows, and purify one's downfalls immediately and daily. This is how we practice vowed conduct in Tibetan Buddhism. I don't really care how they do it in other schools, but this question was posed in the Tibetan Buddhist forum.

From a Tibetan Buddhist point of view, based  on how we read the Abhidharmakośa:

Morality, good conduct, action and discipline
-- Abhk 4:16a-b, Pruden

 Thus the vows are actually a form of action which has results —&nbsp;positive ones when followed, negative ones when broken. 

One's abiding in a state of virtue or non-virtue derived from receiving any of the three vows is not dependent upon whether anyone else knows about it or not. It is dependent upon whether or not one has taken proper efforts to guard one's vows carefully.

Phil, you need to read Kongtrul's Buddhist ethics.

I never entertained the notion that followers of Buddhadharma should not learn from teachers of other schools. While we have a rich analysis of the tenets of others schools, sometimes they seem a little like parodies of them. So it is useful to hear a Yoga master teach on Samkhya and Yoga, an Advaita master teach on Advaita and so on. Nevertheless, one does this in order to understand how these tenets are different from Buddhadharma, in addition to understanding their commonalities. 

For example, I myself spent six weeks learning Yoga, the Yoga Sutras, Samkhya and so on from a well respected disciple of Krishnamacarya a couple of years ago. It was a valuable experience because now I can say that I really understand the system of the Yoga Sūtras, Samkhya, and so on, and how they are distinct from Buddhadharma. To study with a tīrthika teacher is not the same as going for for refuge in something other than Buddhadharma. As bodhisattvas, we are supposed to study everything, particularly adhyatmyavidyā, the inner sciences. Of course, the classical inner sciences in Dharma are Prajñāpāramita, Madhyamaka and so on, but we can also consider the study of non-=Buddhist tenet systems to be part of that study. Of course there is a danger, if one is not discerning, that one will become confused  —&nbsp;but as long as one is clear about where one's refuge lies, there there will not be a problem in the end.

I am deeply puzzled by this —&nbsp;I can only conclude it stems from some sort of wishful thinking that is propped up on perennialist tendencies [god, now I sound like a marxist]. 

I see no evidence at all from anything that Ramana said or wrote that his view is anything other than stock Hinduism of the Advaitan variety. I have no doubt he was a remarkable person, but at this point, since he died 65 years ago, longer than most of us have been alive, why would I accept anything that anyone says about him that differs from what is found in his texts? 

I guess I do not understand what is profound in Ramana's teachings. I find the Buddha profound, I find Nāgārjuna profound, etc. But when I read the works of Hindu masters I always find them to be a bit off in one regard or another. So, admittedly, I find it really hard to understand why people who have been introduced to the teachings of Buddhadharma find Ramana profound. 

Seriously, I find Vasubandhu more profound that Ramana. In the case of Dzogchen, it is particularly hard to understand why people find Advaita profound given that Śankara is named in the Rig pa rang shar tantra among the sixty wrong views to be rejected, and given that Advaita is refuted in Santarakṣita's Tattvasamgraha and so on.

For example, if you have a mountain in the east, and another in the west, do you tell someone that by climbing a mountain in the east, they will ascend the same peak as the mountain in the west? 

All I have said is that Hinduism and Buddhism have a different basis, therefore the path is different and the result is different. I have not instructed anyone which mountain they should climb —&nbsp;merely that one cannot climb two mountains at once, and also that one cannot expect to reach the peak of one mountain by climbing another.

It is hard to take this literally when Vimalamitra's commentary on the sgra thal gyur states:

"Great" means that the Great Perfection is free from a basis; but because it is a basis, it is convention for abiding; because it is a path, it is convention of expression; and because it is a result, it is convention of nature.


This seems very consistent with Vimalakirti's statement:

Manjusri, when something is baseless, how can it have any root? Therefore, all things stand on the root which is baseless.

Silence has a context. In this case, we have to examine Ramana's silence in the context of his speech:

The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. Just as the knowledge of the rope
which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the
realization of the Self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is
real is removed.
http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/wp-con ... o_am_I.pdf

This is the meaning of Ramana's silence. Compare with Vimalakirti:

Manjusri, when something is baseless, how can it have any root? Therefore, all things stand on the root which is  baseless.

What Ramakrishna says above is a pure Advaitan spin on Samkhya. He is referring here to the Advaitan interpretation of Purusha, aka Brahmin. 

So no, Ramakrishna does not "get it", as it were. There is no reality beyond the extremes of existence and non-existence, and this of course is the meaning of the famed silence of Vimalakirti in the non-duality chapter:

When the bodhisattvas had given their explanations, they all addressed the crown prince Manjusri: "Manjusri, what is the bodhisattva's entrance into nonduality?"

Manjusri replied, "Good sirs, you have all spoken well. Nevertheless, all your explanations are themselves dualistic. To know no one teaching, to express nothing, to say nothing, to explain nothing, to announce nothing, to indicate nothing, and to designate nothing - that is the entrance into nonduality."

Then the crown prince Manjusri said to the Licchavi Vimalakirti, "We have all given our own teachings, noble sir. Now, may you elucidate the teaching of the entrance into the principle of nonduality!"

Thereupon, the Licchavi Vimalakirti kept his silence, saying nothing at all.

As we can see, this passage reflects the Buddha's teaching on the inexpressibility cited in the Sutta Nipata.

Further, the Samputa Tantra states:

Not empty, not non-empty, 
there is also nothing to perceive in the middle. 

Thus we can see that Ramakrishna's statement does not correspond to the Buddha's teaching.

There is no "nonduality" that stands alone by itself, somewhere else, or even here. 

As I said before, "nondual" is a technical term in Buddhadharma that has many uses. Principally speaking, it refers to an individual's state of consciousness free from subject and object or it refers to the absence of relative dualities such as samsara/nirvana, being/nonbeing, pure/impure, nondual/dual, etc. In the latter case, this absence of dualities itself is predicated on emptiness free from extremes. 

Even so, nonduality is a meaningless expression without reference to plurality, so even nonduality cannot bear analysis. For this reason Nāgārjuna, when commenting on his Praise of the Three Kāyas states when commenting on this line, "Not one, not many, becoming the basis for the very abundant benefit of myself and others."

For "not one, not many...." and so on, one and many means one and many i.e., both are nondual. Many means plural. Conventionally speaking "I prostate" to that which is the dharmakāya, neither one nor many. If it is asked "For what reason do we say though it is not one, it is also not many?" Due to that, since it is said "non-arisen from the beginning", that which never arose from the beginning cannot have a phase of being one or many; like space, its nature is completely uninterrupted. Since all phenomena arise in the same way, therefore, what arises where? That which becomes a form of diversity is not seen by anyone, i.e. just as grains of rice arise from rice seed, likewise, whatever arises from emptiness is not permanent nor annihilated. Why? Free of all concepts, the victors see that to be empty and illusory. 

The point I am trying to get you to understand is that "nonduality" spoken of by the Buddha, Nāgārjuna, Asanga and so on is nothing like the nonduality spoken of by Shankara, etc. Now of course, many speculate —&nbsp;on the basis of Gaudapada's Agamasaśtra's fourth section —&nbsp;that Shankara was influence by Mahāyāna Buddhism. If so, Shankara sure spends a lot of time in his commentary on the Brahma Sutras trying to prove that he is not influenced by Mahāyāna. 

In the above comment, an important point must no be overlooked. Here Nāgārjuna is equating all phenomena's mode of arising with the mode of arising of the non-arisen dharmakāya —&nbsp;which is to say that phenomena do not arise. It is the perception of the nonarising of phenomena which leads to the ultimate attainment of the dharmakāya. That perception of the nonarising of phenomena is the perception of emptiness. 

Moreover, Nāgārjuna invokes the principle of likeness of causes and effects —&nbsp;i.e. just as rice arises from rice seed, likewise, just as emptiness is neither permanent or annihilated, whatever arise from emptiness is neither permanent or annihilated, the Buddhas perceive that to be empty and illusory, without any vikalpa, conceptuality or imagination. 

There is no permanent substrate which accounts for the arising of phenomena ultimately, and relatively, all phenomena arise because of cause and conditions  —dependent origination —&nbsp;rather than from a creative principle such as Iśvara and so on. 

Then of course there is also the fact that Advaita heavily depends on Saṃkhya, the Saṃkya notion of purusha as we can see in the Tattvabodhi and other texts, this is yet another reason why the principle of nonduality in Buddhadharma and Advaita are not commensurable and so do not lead the same realization.

I did understand. It is a dodge. The Advaita POV is summed nicely in "One without a second." In Buddhadharma on the other hand, "nonduality", depending on which nonduality one is speaking of, is a subjective experience confined to a person's mindstream. Of course there is an objective nonduality, called "śūnyatā". Śūnyatā is rejected by Advaita [e.g. Shankara].

Or:

When that yogin dwells in the experience of nonconceptual discerning wisdom [prajñā] and experiences nonduality, at that time, ultimately, the entire reality of objects of knowledge are as follows, of the same characteristics, like space, appearing in the manner of a nonappearance since their characteristics are nonexistent, therefore, there isn't even the slightest thing that is not empty, so where could there be emptiness? Since there are no mental discriminations, there is no conceptual clinging of mutual dependence."

Or the Kaumudī, a famous Buddhist tantric commentary, states:

Because of the absence of inherent existence, the nondual essence of all phenomena is emptiness.

It also is understood, as Dzogchungpa point outed, as a consciousness devoid of subject and object, as the Ḍākinīvajrapañjara[-mahā]tantrarājasya pañjikā[-prathamapaṭala-]mukhabandha-nāma

One is a nondual consciousness. 
Two is an apprehending subject and an apprehended object.

These quotes are not exhaustive, but they show that "nondual" in Buddhadharma is really quite different than Advaita.

Once again, here Advaita and Buddhadharma are absolutely incommensurate, and as I pointed out, it is only Hindus who imagine that Advaita and Buddhadharma are talking about the same thing, i.e., knowledge of Brahman.

The only resemblance between Advaita and Buddhadharma is that we both seek to solve the same problem — avidyā. What we understand vidyā to be is completely different.

This is the Advaita we are arguing against:

This world is unreal like the image of a city in the mirror, it exists inside. Due to the power of Maya it looks as if it is manifested outside like in dream we see things outside ourselves. Salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor, who, at the time of self realization, makes one aware that Atma is without second (i.e. one).

Like a tree inside a seed this world is not manifested initially. Later on it gets manifested due to Maya in space, time and various forms. Salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor who like a magician, through his yogic powers, transforms it by his own will.

Who inspires to discriminate between the real 'I' and its imagined, unreal meaning; who imparts direct knowledge of 'You are That' as said in Vedas to his dependents; without direct connection with whom, it is impossible to cross this ocean of birth and death, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥3॥

Who emanates from eyes and other sense organs like the light of a lamp kept in a vessel with multiple pores; by whose grace, I know that this light only illumines the entire world, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥4॥

Those who consider themselves as body, life force, sense organs, dynamic intelligence or nothing are deluded like women, kids, blinds and dull-minded. Who ends this great anxiety due to the play of Maya, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor. ॥5॥

The unborn, unaware self is properly covered due to Maya like Sun and Moon eclipsed by Rahu. It shines forth once all barriers are removed. Who makes it realize that you are one with that slept self, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥6॥

Self is ever present in various stages of body like childhood, etc., various stages of mind like waking, etc. and unattached. Who always resonates like 'I am That', who reveals himself happily and beautifully on remembering, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor. ॥7॥

Self sees this world in many forms of himself like action and cause, servant and owner, teach er and disciple, father and son, etc. By whose power, Maya; Self looks to be wandering in dream and waking, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥8॥

Whatever is seen in this moving and non-moving world is made up of eight forms of Shiva - Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space, Sun, Moon and Self. On contemplation, there is nothing beyond him, salutations to all pervading Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥9॥

'You are Self of all' is realized by your worship, listening about you, thinking over you, meditating and singing for you. You, the almighty God, are experienced with all your unstoppable grandeur, in eight forms. Salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥10॥

Yes, and thus this is a crucial distinction between Buddhism and Vedanta in general.

Mahāmadhyamaka is a term that has a complicated history. Gzhan stong does not have the trademark on it. 

For example, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen writes in his Great Song of Experience:

Freedom from extremes is beyond knowledge, expressions and objects, 
Madhyamaka, Cittamatra and so on,
expressions in words are proliferations...
That view of Great Madhyamaka
is bliss without delusion because it is not a proposition. 

This was written 100 years before Dolbupa was even born. In fact the Gelugpas also refer to Lama Tsongkhapa's view as Great Madhyamaka and so on. 

Of course, if you examine, you will find the early Nyingma, Kadampa, Sakya and Kagyu uses of the term more consistent with how the term is used in Indian texts. For example Atisha writes extensively about Mahāmadhyamaka. So what does he say? In his Bodhimārgapradīpapañjikā-nāma, his autocommentary on the Lamp of the Path of Awakening, the foundation text for all Lam Rim:

To explain the essence of Master Nāgārjuna's teaching, that is comprehended to be the great madhyamaka [dbu ma chen po] beyond existence and nonexistence, the meaning of Prajñāpāramitā, and it is also taught the same way in the texts of other scholars. As such, it is the intention of Guru Bodhibhadra, and Jetsun Kusulupa. That nectar of Ārya Nāgārjuna satisfied Āryadeva, Candrakīrti, Śantideva and Bodhibhadra, and a little of it was also sprinkled on me. With four great arguments all phenomena are proven to be nonarising —&nbsp; one should abide in the philosophical conclusion of the great madhyamaka through following the masters of the past. 

One never finds the term "great madhyamaka" being used by the Yogacara authors. 

One place where the term is used, and I believe is in fact its origin, is that it is used frequently to describe the completion stage in tantric commentaries. But again, its description is not out of line with mainstream Indian Madhyamaka. For example, in the Śrīhevajranāmatantrārthasaṁgraha:

"After that, explain the meaning of the great madhyamaka free from all extremes...."

Or in the Śrīsaṁpuṭatilaka-nāma-yoginītantrarājasya ṭīkā-smṛitisaṁdarśanāloka-nāma:

"Full expansion of qualities" means buddhahood comes from Mantrayāna and great madhyamaka.

Or the Bhagavadd-hevajrasādhana-abhisamayakramārthaprasanna-nāma:

Meditate upon the great madhyamaka
free from all signs. 

Or the Śrī-kālacakropadeśayogaṣaḍaṅgatantrapañjikā-nāma:

The nature of completion is called "great madhyamaka". 

The Śrī-ḍākārṇavamahāyoginītantrarājasyaṭīkāvohitaṭikā-nāma:

"Madhyamaka" is the essential Dharma and the great Madhyamaka of the Mahāyāna free from the four extremes is the awakening of the fortunate.

Or the Samājābhisamayālaṁkāravṛtti:

Having manifested the great madhyamaka that is immaculate like space...

The Upadeśaniścaya-nāma-śrīguhyasamājavṛtti states:

The neutral recitation is meditating body, speech and mind in the state of great madhyamaka —&nbsp;beyond all extremes of signs, because it isn't anything at all, it is called "neutral". 

The Āryamañjuśrīnāmasaṁgītiṭīkāsārābhisamaya states:

"Due to be being free it is like a reflection" —&nbsp;a mere reflection to which there is freedom from clingning, or even being free from the mere designation "reflection" is the great madhyamaka free from the four extremes. For which it is also said:

The diversity is not permanent,
nor is its annihilation proposed;
neither permanent nor annihilated,
also not both —
liberated from all four extremes
that is the reasoning of a mādhyamika.

[quote="smcjSince the transcendent (beyond cause and effect) Wisdom Mind is unborn and never comes into existence it is not subject to the same deconstruction and can be said to be real.
[/quote]

From a Madhyamaka perspective, something that never comes into existence is a nonexistent, and cannot be considered real by Madhyamaka definitions. It is therefore also not immune to Madhyamaka analysis. In this respect too, "wisdom mind" is no different than all the other phenomena that do not arise (which is all of them), and therefore are not real. 

The classical  Tibetan refutation of gzhan stong is the Madhyamaka refutation of the unconditioned in the MMK:

If arising, abiding and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established. 
If the condition has never been established, where will the unconditioned be established?

The classical Tibetan refutation of the charge of "rang stong" is the following statement from the MMK:

If there were some thing subtly not empty, there would be some thing to be empty, 
but as there is no thing that is not empty, where is there some thing to be empty?

Finally, the rejection of that the world has a nature:

Whatever is the nature of the tathāgata, that is the nature of the world.
As tathāgata has no nature, also the world has no nature. 

In reality, following the opinion of Rongtong Sheja Kunrig, gzhan stong is a kind of transitional view between classical yogacara and madhyamaka, and is in fact little more than a variant of the false-aspectarian yogacara mainly promulgated by Ratnakarashanti.

When I spoke with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso, he did not admit, nor was I pressing the point, that Advaita and gzhan stong were identical: the point was that both systems were structurally similar only in that they asserted the relative was completely unreal and the ultimate completely real. Even though he agreed with this characterization, he strongly emphasized at that time that despite this similarity, Advaita does not have buddhahood as a result. I add this just so you are clear about what I asked, and what he replied. 

The other thing that plagues gzhan stong is that unlike classical Indian Madhyamaka, of which two clear trends can be observed —&nbsp;gzhan stong, being largely a Tibetan innovation, has a plethora of interpretations. 

Finally, as to the term "mahāmadhyamaka". As I have pointed out several times now, the earliest use the the term in a Tibetan text is by the Nyingma author Kawa Paltseg, the translator from the early 9th century. In his Explanation of The Stages of the View he refers to Mahāmadhyamaka as:

Freedom from the two extremes in the ultimate 
is asserted to be mahāmadhyamaka

The of course we have Naropa's statement in the Abbreviation of the View, translated by Marpa Lotsawa, which paraphrases the Hevajra Tantra:

That thing, samsara, 
that is nirvana, 
that is mahāmadhyamaka.

Now, I am  not very sure why some Kagyus have abandoned to view of Naropa and Marpa, but it sure seems that they have, because the above sentiment is impossible in gzhan stong, where nirvana is by definition empty of samsara, not identical with it.

Ummm, no, not in Buddhadharma. The content of awakening is the same between a first stage bodhisattva and a buddha —&nbsp;the only things that differentiates the awakening of bodhisattvas and buddhas is that a bodhisattva still has obscurations of affliction and omniscience to remove, and a buddha does not. Otherwise, there is no difference in the emptiness they realize. They realize the same emptiness. 

For this reason, for example, Maitreyanatha describes sentient beings, bodhisattvas and buddhas respectively as impure, impure/pure, and pure.

"Nonduality" in Buddhdharma is the simple fact that the two predicates of things, "existence" and "nonexistence", are false. That is all and nothing more. 

That is not how Shankaracarya understands "nonduality", which is that the nondual state is "one without a second", i.e. existent.

Given that this is so, "nonduality" in Buddhdharma and Advaita are not even remotely commensurate.

Those who think so either do not understand a) Buddhadharma b) Advaita c) Both. In general, it is usually Advaitans who do not understand Buddhadharma who make the mistake of equating the treatment of nonduality in Buddhadharma and Advaita. One thing is for sure ‚&nbsp;the ancient Indian Buddhist masters were not confused about this distinction.

If you are a translator, you should practice in Tibetan. 

If you are with a Tibetan Lama doing a group practice, you should practice in "Tibetan", even if it sounds awful (it does). 

If you are by yourself, you should practice in English, because just as mantras pronounced improperly will only delay your practice; just as mumbling your sadhanas will delay your practice; chanting liturgies in phoneticized "Tibetan" only results in making sounds which at best only vaguely resemble Tibetan, sounds which you do not understand, nor will be understood by anyone who is a Tibetan speaker, and thus you will merely cause obstacles for yourself. 

This does not mean one should not take pains to learn Tibetan, which is the only proper way to learn how to pronounce it. This does not mean that certain prayers like the seven line prayer, the Migtsema, the short Barceh Lamsel and so on should not be recited in Tibetan —&nbsp;of course they should -- it is easy to learn how to properly pronounce a few lines of Tibetan. This does not mean one can practice a chod liturgy in English (attempts have been made but they all suck). But as a general rule English speakers who do not know Tibetan should practice in English apart from the above noted exceptions, that at least is my opinion.

We see a move towards Sanskritization even during the Buddha's day. For example, there is a passage  [I believe it is the Majjihma Nikāya] recounting how two Brahmin disciples of the Buddha derided another monk who only knew vernacular for being unable to distinguish between long and short vowels when he recited the Sūtras. These two earned the censure of the Buddha for sure, but we can see the roots of Sanskritization even in the Nikayas from this example. 

When the Sarvastivadins set their canon down, they set it down in Sanskrit for the obvious reason I stated —&nbsp;it was the language of the educated all across India. In particular, if you hold that Sarvastivada come from the region of what is now Pakistan and the Punjab, this is the traditional homeland of the Vedas and according to the accounts you follow, a Brahmanical stronghold.

Plus, a very large proportion of monks in the time of the Buddha were bhramins, and so on and so forth.

There is no difference between the fourth empowerment and direct introduction. They both involve inductions of specific experiences. 

The fourth empowerment is an introduction based on the induction of a specific experience in the student, likewise, so is direct introduction.

Though it is called the "word empowerment", the actual fourth empowerment is not truly contained within words such as "this is like space...", etc. But when combined with this or that specific experience, the fourth empowerment/direct introduction introduces the student to the nature of their minds experientially, and then it can be called the word empowerment because the nature of that experience has been described to them in a way that they understand the experience that they have had. That experience itself is the example, wisdom, not the words.

It is one thing to respect the religion of your ancestors, it is quite another to be confused about refuge. 

The issue of Gorakṣanātha was raised. It is true he is counted among the 84 siddhas. It is said he was raised in a Buddhist family and later converted to Shaivism. It is a little unclear what his story is. But this anomaly sheds light on Hathayogapradipika's criticism of the Buddhist siddha Nagabodhi, showing that in such yogic circles there was definite tension between Hindus and Buddhists. 

In the example of Mahasiddha Virupa, it was unclear to everyone whether he was Buddhist or Hindu. In order to find out, he was dragged in front of the King of Benares. When it was ascertained he was a Buddhist, he was condemned to death, bound in chains and flung into the Ganges. Houdini-like, he escaped. There are other episodes in his biography which illustrate that Buddhist siddhis circulated among non-Buddhists as part of their vratya, their yogic discipline, to challenge their own realization. In another episode of Virupa's life, after having been invited to be the leader of a royal panel of non-Buddhist panditas,  when it was discovered the book to which he prostrated was the Prajñāpāramitā in 8000 lines, the king (a different one) ordered him to bow to a Shiva linga. Virupa replied that is was inappropriate for an elder brother to prostrate to the younger, and warned the king that it was not going to go well. The kind insisted that Virupa prostrate to this linga, and after he prostrated to it, it shattered, eliciting a complaint from Shiva himself. Virupa was so skilled at conversion through magical displays, eventually Avalokiteshvara interceded and asked Virupa to cease terrifying people with his powers. 

We can understand from all this that it is not appropriate for those who have sought refuge in the Three Jewels to seek refuge elsewhere. So the answer to the question "Can one be a Buddhist and a Christian", "can on be a Buddhist and a Hindu", "can one be a Buddhist and a religious Jew" is no. Just as one cannot serve two kings, but must bear allegiance to one above any other, likewise, one cannot belong to Buddhadhama and so some religion and expect any kind of result from from the former, as it clearly states in the Vinaya stanza above.

The term "sūtra" mahāmudra, according to Kongtrul and even Gampopa himself, is used for the teaching given to those people who are incapable of practicing Vajrayāna for this or that reason but who are nevertheless interested in Mahāmudra. They are taught śamatha and vipaśyāna, the experience of which is clarified by quotes from dohas, etc. 

But without the example wisdom as well as the profound dependent originations arranged by the guru at the time of empowerment, this sūtra mahāmudra cannot go beyond the common practice of the six perfections. 

There are many terms for the state of buddhahood in various systems. The meaning is the same, but the means differ, and the length of time to the result as well. 

The means of realizing mahāmudra is the two stages and or guru yoga. It is the practice of the an example wisdom introduced at the time of empowerment. This leads to buddhahood in one life, or seven or at most sixteen. 

It takes three incalculable eons at minimum to progress to buddhahood via the sūtra path. 

The level of insight experienced in Vajrayāna completion stage practices involve the experience of levels of mind more subtle than is possible in sutra meditation of plain śamatha and vipaśyāna, which is another reason why it is more rapid than sutra meditation.

They are formless in that they do not have physical bodies, though the rich representation of them, especially in Tibetan astrological and medical paintings, represents an attempt to show their class by giving them recognizable attributes. 

As tingzin notes there is a bit of slippage between the term deva and lha, but when classified in Tibetan medicine and Ayurveda, the deva-bhutagraha is still a formless spirit which causes the person affected to wear white, be obsessed with purity, to speak in Sanskrit and so on.

"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute.

"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away &amp; reappearance of beings. I saw — by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human — beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech &amp; mind, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who did not revile the Noble Ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human — I saw beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.

"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute.

"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. I discerned, as it had come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'

"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute.

No, actually we cannot "empirically" verify the of the cause of dukha, because dukkha is caused by karma, and karma itself is caused by affliction. There is no dukkha that is not caused by karma. There are no means by which dukkha may be measured. Liberation itself is defined as freedom from affliction, and that too cannot be measured, so there is nothing at all "empirically verifiable" in Buddhadharma. The idea that there is, is a hangover from an earlier period of Western perceptions of Buddhism. 

You might argue, Buddha said that the cause of dukkha is clinging, but here clinging itself is just affliction which gives rise to an action that results in suffering. If you restrict yourself to a one lifetime model, there is no reason to select Buddhadharma over a secular twelve steps program...

Empirical verification depends on the observable quantification of a data set. No one has ever empirically verified that Buddhadharma

In terms of what kind of family one is born into, wealth, poverty, class, etc., this is definitely solely a result of karma. The Buddha says in the Ārya Āyuṣman Nanda Garbhāvakrānti Nirdeśa:

Then, the Bhagavan said this to Āyusman Nanda, “Nanda, when a sentient being wishes to enter the womb, if causes and conditions are perfect, a body will appropriated. However, if [the causes and conditions] are not perfect, a body will not be appropriated. If one should ask that sentient beings does not possess the conditions, it is as follows. Though a man and a woman have the mental factor of desire, and the intermediate state aggregate is present and seeking a womb, should that male and female have sexual intercourse too soon or too late or not have intercourse at that one time; or should there be some diseases in the body of either [the male or the female], there will be no ‘entry into the womb’. If family line of the male and the female are noble and their merit is great, but the intermediate state aggregate has small merit, or should the the intermediate state being have a noble family line and great merit, [65] but the male and female have small [merit] or though they both have merit, but if the accumulation of karma is not mutual, then there will be no ‘entry into the womb’.”

In terms of birth defects and so on, this can be karmic; this can also be a result of various factors in the pregnancy, genetic defects, etc. Without clairvoyance it is difficult to know.

I have never observed anything but kindness towards disabled people, have never heard any talk about their being "at fault" for their disability. On the other hand, I have heard many Tibetans describe their own suffering in this life as a result of their own misdeeds in past lives, quite cheerfully and without any rancor. 

Hell, even the Tibetan penal system in Lhasa took karma into account, assuming that in many cases it was pointless to administer a punishment for this or that crime, because the criminal was going to suffer in future lives for crimes committed in this life. This attitude lent itself to rather lenient treatments of many kinds of crimes. See Rebecca French's book on Tibetan law and jurisprudence. 

I think that part of the issue is that people raised in western cultures spend of a lot of time dealing with issues of "guilt", and spend a lot of time trying to avoid feelings of guilt.

For one meets with short-lived and long-lived people, sick and healthy people, ugly and beautiful people, insignificant and influential people, poor and rich people, low-born and high-born people, stupid and wise people. What is the reason, what is the condition, why superiority and inferiority are met with among human beings, among mankind?"

3. "Student, beings are owners of kammas, heirs of kammas, they have kammas as their progenitor, kammas as their kin, kammas as their homing-place. It is kammas that differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiority."

And:

 "Here, student, some woman or man is one who harms beings with his hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives. Due to having performed and completed such kammas, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation... If instead he comes to the human state, he is sickly wherever he is reborn. This is the way that leads to sickness, that is to say, to be one who harms beings with one's hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives.

The Karmavibhanga states:

There is karma that result in an unattractiveness of complexion. There is karma that results in beauty.

There are many such teachings where the Buddha indicates that karma is involved in directly involved in illnesses, some we would term "genetic" illnesses. The Buddha continues:

In that respect, if it is asked what are the karmas resulting in many illnesses, there are ten factors that result in many illnesses: striking out with fists and palms etc.; believing it is proper to strike out with fists, palms, etc.; praising striking out with fists and palms, etc.; inflicting pain on one's father or mother; inflicting pain on an ārya; being happy when an enemy is afflicted with illness; being unhappy when an enemy recovers from an illness; giving what is beneficial [lit. medicinal], eating food without permission to eat. Those ten factors result in many illnesses, this karma results in many illnesses. 

Therefore, we can see from this that martial artists should be very careful. 

Anyway, there are numerous statements by the Buddha about karma being the cause of physical defects and illness. You can accept this or not.

Title: Re: Karma Fruit of Worldwide Abortions
Content:
First we have to decide whether abortion is himsa or ahimsa. Abortion can hardly be called ahimsa, can it? In fact abortion is the deliberate harming of one sentient being by another, in this case the harming of a child by its mother. 

Every sentient is deserving of the same level of compassion no matter what they have done or what class of sentient being they are. 

On the other hand, Mahāyāna ethics are more important than rigid adherence to the letter of a vow. But to undertake an action on the basis of Mahāyāna ethics, self-interest has to be absolutely absent from one's thinking. 

Because abortion is himsa, harming a sentient being, it cannot be condoned by those who follow Buddhadharma in general. On the other hand, there are always special cases where there may be greater harm in prohibiting an abortion than permitting one, such as examples of severe birth defects, threat to the life of the mother and so on, impregnation through rape, incest, and so on. 

So, in general, the position of Buddhadharma is that abortion is harming another sentient being as well as taking life. In general it is not only a serious breach of pratimokṣa vows to have an abortion or to encourage someone to have an abortion (and in the case of monk, results in a defeat), but it is also serious bodhisattva downfall to either have an abortion or to encourage someone to have an abortion apart from special instances. 

On the other hand, there is the political fact of separation of church and state, which is necessary in any functional so-called "democracy". Though as a follower of Buddhadharma, I am personally opposed to abortion, I am also opposed to legislating religious doctrines into law. So it is something I leave to the courts and legislature to decide as a matter of social policy. 

And finally, just because we followers of Buddhadharma are opposed to abortion in a general way does not mean we should adopt the angry and confrontational rhetoric of the "pro-life" movement. We should have compassion for everyone, since that's what we Mahayanis aim to do, i.e have impartial compassion for all sentient beings.

Vasubandhu does describe collective karma in two ways, one he mentions the example of a soldier. If a group of one hundred soldiers kills a person, everyone on is that group bears the weight of the action times the number of people who participated in it, or even approved of it. 

Secondly, an example of collective karma is our world. It came about because we all have similar actions, leading to not only the formation of this world, but our birth upon it. 

"The variety of the world comes from action."

Thus, the action of killing, abortion being killing, leads to shortened lives, etc.

Don't you remember the episode where he had no money to give Marpa, and Dagmema gave him a piece of turquoise for the fee? When Marpa found out he was livid and threw Milarepa out.

The of course there is the famous examples of Drogmi and Rwa. They both had set fees for teachings, this much for the empowerment, this much for the intimate instruction, this much for the sadhana explanation and so on. In Tibet, prior to the institutionalization of Vajrayāna lineages, the habits of gurus were to set fees. Don't you recall that Longchenpa was depressed he could not attend the Vima Nyinthig empowerment given by Kumararaja? So Kumararaja secretly gave him the empowerment fee so he could attend. The Dorje Gotrab root text specifies it should not be given to anyone who does not fork over gold. ChNN joked about this, when he first gave the lung for the whole text. 

After Vajrayāna was institutionalized then it became common for teachings like the Nyingthig Yazhi, Lamdre and so on to be freely given. But even here, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa stated that while he was able to attend the Rinchen Terzod for free, he never received any instructions on the practices it contained because he could not afford to pay for them. So the perception that Dharma was free or sponsored in Tibet is somewhat true, and also somewhat false. It is more complicated then most people realize.

Rigpa is just a name for the mind —&nbsp;sometimes that mind knows its own state, sometimes it doesn't. When one has that kind of experience on is merely a practitioner on the path, slowly improving, applying one's understanding to the introduction. 

Realization is when that knowledge is permanent and not fleeting, leading to the abandonment of the two obscurations.

Rigpa is not in itself awakening. This is why "uniripened vidyā" appropriates bodies for rebirth, as Vimalamitra clearly explains. Vidyā is just a name for the nature of the mind, which is why Vimalamitra describes vidyā as "knowing (rig) and clear (gsal)."

You are confusing institutions with lineages. 

The founder of a Vajrayāna lineage is not the Tibetan who collected some Indian teachings and started an institution, but the awakened master who had the capacity to directly communicate with Vajradhara and pass that transmission along. These four women had that capacity which is why they all stand at the heads of lineages of Vajrayāna transmission. 

These four women, five when including Macig, were recognized as important in their own milieu, which is why we have their teachings and texts with us today, which are regularly cited and commented upon to the present day.

The Dzogchen teachings are not something found outside of Buddhadharma for the simple reason that they are a Dharma that was taught by the Buddhas no amount of intellectual posturing can change this fact. Does this mean that someone has to sign up with a card that says "Registered Buddhist" like it is a political party? No, of course not. 

These days a sort of intellectual "Dzogchen" is very fashionable —&nbsp;but it generally arises from a misconstrual of the Dzogchen tradition divorced from the matrix in which it emerged, the religious culture of Tibet from the 9th to the 12th century. During this four centuries, Dzogchen teachings were gradually promulgated in the context of Secret Mantra. One thing that ChNN also says is that there is no such a thing as "pure Dzogchen." What he means by this is that there is no practice of Dzogchen divorced from the rest of the Buddhist path (Bonpos are just  Buddhists with a differing historical narrartive regarding the origins of their teachings). He also states in very plain language that the result of Sūtra, Tantra and Dzogchen are the same —&nbsp;the same buddhahood. He never makes this claim with regard to Christianity, Hinduism, Taoism and so on. Of course another intellectual fashion of the current day is that imagine that somehow there are teachings equivalent to Dzogchen in schools outside of Buddhadharma. This assertion is laughable. Beyond this, Dzogchen texts themselves take great pains to site their own teachings within the horizon of Buddhadharma, and outside the horizon of the teachings of this and that tīrthika school. 

The only thing radical about Dzogchen in the end is that a few people might have the capacity recognize their own stated and live in that knowledge 24/7 obviating the need for any further path —&nbsp;but those of us who did not recognize that state and entered into delusion must labor away at our two obscurations, even though, as it is clearly stated in the Prajñāpāramita that when we reach the final result we will realize that there was nothing to accomplish and nothing to remove all along. In the meantime however, we soldier on because while we are under the the power of karma and afflictions there is a basis of purification and a reason for purification. This is recognized also in Dzogchen teachings, thus the reason there are so many purifications practices, purification practices for body, speech, mind and so on. The entire first chapter of the Dimension of Sound (sgra thal 'gyur) tantra consists of nothing but purification practices, including creation stage and completion stage practices, and the entire first volume of Vimalamitra's commentary to this text consists of nothing more than elaborating all these practices in detail. 

As to the notion that direct introduction is sufficient, this is a gross error of understanding. As the famed Semde master Zhigpo Dudtsi points out, the only chigcharwas (instantaneous realizers) he knew of were Saraha and Lingje Repa (neither of them even Dzogchen practitioners), but that while he had sought out some other examples, he did not know of any while not ruling out the possibility that they existed. But it seems these days everyone is a chigcharwas. Further, if you are not practicing the profound teaching of thögal, one has no way of working with pure vision apart from the two stages. It is for this reason then that Tregchö&nbsp;is always combined with deity yoga in Dzogchen practice. As such, the practice of most so called Dzogchen practice is no different than what the Sakyapas, Gelugpas and Kagyus do, even though Nyingma sadhanas are gussied up with many fancy high sounding words. The plain reality is that most people do not have the capacity or time to practice Dzogchen in a serious way. This being the case, for example, ChNN strongly advises everyone to practice the short thun, which is a anuyoga sadhana combined with ati guruyoga. He explicitly says no one can remain in samadhi (contemplation) all the time, and so therefore, in order to do something useful, we have all these secondary practices which support samadhi, which create a container for it. 

As to the the importance of tradition. There is no Dzogchen without lineage. A Dzogchen book without a live transmission is like a cellphone without a battery, it won't receive any calls. Dzogchen, as ChNN says again and again, does not live in a book, it lives in the transmission between teacher and student. That transmission is oral, symbolic and experiential. All of the different methods of empowerment, elaborate and so, are all methods of communicating that knowledge orally, symbolically and  experientially. That knowledge is no different than what is communicated through the four empowerments of the Sarma schools. While the four Dzogchen empowerments may be more detailed, and in some sense they may be a bit more profound in details, a beginner cannot comprehend this. Without a great deal of understanding of Vajrayāna, the teaching of Dzogchen is completely opaque. 

The teaching of Dzogchen is not confined to paeans of praise about our natural state. It consists of detailed instructions about the human body, it's channels, functions and so on, all of which require ripening through empowerment. If Dzogchen were only about our natural state, it would not go beyond the Prajñāpāramita sūtras. 

As one of the Dzogchen tantras puts it —&nbsp;Mahāyoga is the ground, Anuyoga is the sky, and Atiyoga is the sun and moon which illuminates both. Dzogchen is called the pinnacle not because Mahāyoga and Anuyoga are unnecessary, but because, as Rongzom points out, it is needed for making other practices fruitful. This is not different than the Lamdre contention that the experiential view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana that comes from empowerment must be meditated prior to engaging in the two stages. 

In the end, I am afraid that the Sakya master, Dezhung Ajam ( a disciple of Adzom Drugpa) was right, many people who claim to be Dzogchen practitioners are like people whose bodies are separated from their heads —&nbsp;in other words, their "Dzogchen" is just intellectual theory. Sadly, we see many such discussions in the internet in various forums by various people that are completely ungrounded. These people, sadly, merely block their own realization. What a pity.

Then you are not really qualified to do the Sakya Ngondro anyway — no wonder you are having obstacles in your practice. The Sakya Ngondro practice depends on having received the cause Hevajra Empowerment. You cannot even practice the refuge practice without this empowerment. 

However, you should not feel you are not qualified to receive major empowerments. It is not hard to maintain one's vows, one does so by reciting Vajrasattva 21 times every day. There is tremendous blessing from the vows. It is better to receive them and break them, then to have never received them at all. 

You can however meditate on the topics of the Three Visions, and you can do any of the other kinds of the Dharma practice such as making offering, reciting sutras like the Heart Sutra and so on.

It is important to the Nyingmapas and the Kagyus.

I do, because there is nothing substantive about it at all in Indian texts. It is only mentioned once in the entire Yogacarabhumi. Other than that, the Yogacarins totally ignore it.

The Indians really did not discuss the issue of the three turnings at all, especially not the Indians you would most expect, namely the Yogacara authors, Maitreya, Asanga, Vasubandhu, etc. Not even the later Yogacara authors bring it up. 

The only sustained discussion of the issue is the massive commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana sutra preserved in the bstan 'gyur by the Korean master Wen Tshegs (Wŏnch'ŭk, 613-696).He starts his text saying:

The sovereign of Dharma taught the wheel of Dharma in three aspects. The first of those was turned in the Deer Park in Varanasi for those who were devoted the śravakayāna, and the causes and results of nirvana were fully taught. This is the Dharmawheel of the four noble truths. 

The second was the teaching of the Ārya Prajñāpāramita in sixteen gatherings such as Vulture Peak and so on to those who were devoted to the Bodhisattvayāna. 

The third, the teachings of the Saṃdhinirmocana sutras and so on in pure buddhafields such as Padmagarbha and so on and impure buddhafields, to those devoted to all yānas, is the Dharmawheel of the Mahāyāna of the definitive meaning. This is to be known as the intention of the teaching of the doctrine of the Tathāgata. 

Since there is nothing like this statement by any Indian scholar in any extant text, I must conclude that certain Tibetan scholars (whether they know it or not) rely solely on a 7th century Korean Buddhist discussion of this issue in order to justify their classification of this and that class of sutras as definitive or provisional. But in reality these justifications cannot be made the basis of the extant Indian source texts in both sūtra and śastra. Of course, not having studied this 1000 folio, three volume text in detail, I cannot say whether it presents Indian sources for this idea or not. But I did't see any citations of Indian masters when during the several times I have done close words searches on the text when he discusses the three turnings. 

Interestingly this text defines the Avatamsaka and the Prajñāpāramita [under the influence of the Avatamsaka] both as part of the third turning, but it defines the Nirvana Sutra as the second turning. He further states that the second vehicle only removes imputation [vikalpana], whereas the third turning clarifies the three svabhāvas, and so on. 

Given that he defines the Nirvana as second turning and provisional and given that he devotes only a single sentence to a discussion of tathāgatagarbha, I think it is safe to conclude that for Wen Tshegs, tathāgatagarbha is part of the provisional second turning. It would be interesting to understand how it is that the ten Tathāgatagarbha sūtras came to be regarded by some Tibetans as the essence of the third turning given this fact, because there is surely no evidence from Indian sources that they are to be treated as such. 

See this link about Wen Tsheg's text and how it came to be translated into Tibetan:

Um, how many Nyingma lamas have you actually studied with? 

The fact is that Nyingma monasteries tend to follow whatever Madhyamaka view is dominant in their region. Nyingmapas from Amdo like Shabkar and Jigme Lingpa in general follow Tsongkhapa's presentation, as is still the case today. Nyingmapas from Central Tibet (Mindroling and Dorje Drak) also tend to follow the Gelug presentation since these monasteries are very close to Gelug spheres of influence. Dzogchen Monastery follows Sakyapa approach since they are follow Khenpo Shenga and his famous 13 treatises presentation. Phalyul tries to follow Mipham, but Mipham is very similar to Sakya. Nyingmas from Kongpo like Dudjom R, and Khathok monastery tend to follow Shentong, because a) Rigzin Tsewang Norbu was from Khatok and it was from here that  he spread Shentong spread into Kagyu anyway.

Dzogchen teaching make a clear distinction between the basis (the time of non-realization) and the result. 

The real issue which causes argument is whether tathagatāgabha, a.k.a., the dharmakāya at the time of the basis, is something that is naturally perfected or something which requires development. In general, the Sakyapas for example argue that the natural perfection of the qualities of awakening in the person does not conflict with transformation in the same way the natural presence of the quality in milk which produces butter does not mitigate or render unnecessary the process of transformation which produces butter (churning). Longchenpa for example argues that while the two accumulations have always been perfected, they need to be reaccumulated in the same sense that a gem that has been lost in a swamp needs to be polished in order to restore its former luster.

The problem really is what does not mean to be omniscient? To have realized the dharmakāya? If the dharmakāya is some truly existent wisdom mind that cannot be cognized by anyone, then it should always arise at all times in everyone without error. 

If not, then it suggests that omniscience, like everything, else, arises from causes. The difficult question is this: If omniscience arises from causes, why does it not cease? Various answers to this problem have been tendered.

There is basically a single mention of three turnings of the wheel in the sūtras, found in the Samdhinirmocana sutra. All it says there is that the wheel turned for Mahāyānis is the meaning to be understood by all yānas, nothing more and nothing less. Why does it say this? Because Mahāyāna was disputed by the Śravakas, so the Buddha turned the Mahāyāna wheel a second time so there would be no mistakes or ambiguity. It really is just an Ekayāna teaching. 

I really don't know where some Tibetans got the idea that it referred to Yogacara literature, but there is absolutely no justification for that interpretation that can be derived from Indian commentaries in the bstan 'gyur. I know this because I have looked for this doctrine there extensively. There is virtually nothing about the three turnings of the wheel to be found in the bstan 'gyur.

The problem is that you are looking for a medium of transference, and Madhyamakas in general reject that there is one, apart from a dharma called a nondissipation (avipraṇāśa, chud mi za ba, which Nāgārjuna states as an opinion he prefers and defends), which functions like a debt. For example, when you borrow money or incur a debt, there is no actual medium that conveys that debt from one moment to the next. But when you owe a debt, everyone agrees that you must pay up when it is demanded of you. When it is paid, the note still exists, even though it can no longer be enforced. Likewise, when one engages in a karma, even though the act itself as ceased, a dharma called a nondissipation is created. This is why the Buddha says:

"The action of corporal beings does not dissipate
even in hundreds of eons."

Nāgar̄juna himself states:

Emptiness and non-annihilation, 
samsara and impermanence, 
the Buddha explained
the phenomena [chos] of nondissipation of karmas.

Even though karmas cease upon acting, their effect do not dissipate unless this nondissipation is removed by the path, or by moving into a dhātu where a given nondissipation is left behind because it can function in that sphere. 

And this all comes about because karmas, like everything else, have no inherent nature. For which reason Candra simply says that karmas ripen because there is no nature which prevents their ripening due to fact of nondissipation.

Thus karmas are not like barren women, and do engender progeny called nondissipation.

As for the first point, well, this obviously not the case despite the definition of samvṛiti —&nbsp;for example, when the Buddha says "When so on so live in such and such time, his clan name was x, the king's name was Y...", such information is not available to ordinary people. If we accept what you are claiming, someone at some time must have this idea in their minds in order for it to be known by the Buddha, thus you are placing firm restrictions on what a Buddha may know. A Buddha knows all things both in terms of their nature and their characteristics. 

Secondly, karma has no intrinsic nature which prevents its ripening at a time in the future. Therefor, this is not weak link you suppose.

Relatively speaking, the Buddha states many times "When I attained awakening...", "Before I attained awakening" and "After I attained awakening" and so on. Ultimately of course there is no one who attains buddhahood, etc., and as Haribhadra points out in the Aloka Prajñāpāramitā commentary, the entire path, from beginning to end, is illusory. So this is why we must understand this through the two truths. For this reason it is said that the basis is the two truths, the path is the two accumulations, and the result is the two kāyas.

First, I was not suggesting you were incorrigible, that was pointed at someone else. 

It is not polemics that are the point, but freeing ourselves of conceptual constructs and their pitfalls, clearly identified. The point is not to criticize others, though this point is often lost, the point is to clearly set out the view to be realized in relief, by examining the views to be discarded one by one, step by step, lower to higher, beginning with annihilationism then all views of self and all realist views, until we discover the true meaning of freedom from proliferation ourselves. 

Most of us have neither sufficient faith that devotion to a guru can be our sole remedy, no matter how realized they are, nor are we sufficiently intelligent that we can avoid erroneous views without study. Therefore, for the plodders amongst us, like myself, a careful program of study in what are incorrect paths and correct paths, lower paths and higher paths, slower paths and faster paths is a necessity, not just a desiderata. In the meantime, we cultivate the best we can, devotion to gurus we do have, since this indeed is the fastest way to liberation.

Dzogchen is a part of Buddhadharma. It's basic theory is the same as the rest of Buddhadharma, i.e, suffering arises because of the false grasping to a self. 

For example, the Tantra of Self-Arisen Vidyā states:

Further, samasara is as follows: 
false view and eternalist view.
The false vehicle is as follows:
held to be three hundred and sixty beliefs in a self. 

And:

Likewise, the countless views of a self are included in two. Those are included in both the eternalist view and annihilationist view. Countless views of self come from those two. Likewise, son of a good family, because you have avoided entering a false path, I have summarized the views of a self and demonstrated them.

And:

The true Dharma is free from a self,
free from the extremes of the taints
of afflicted minds and so on. 

And:

...since there is no appropriation, a self does not exist.

And:

All the objects and conditions of the six consciousness
depend on grasping something; 
if there is no one-sided grasping, there is bliss
free from objects grasped as “mine”,
empty of phenomena grasped as a self, 
and liberated from objects grasped as permanent.

The Tantra of Self-Liberated Vidyā states:

If one conceives of a self, it is a delusion of Māra. 

And:

The one great root māra
is the concept that grasps a self.

The Union of the Sun and the Moon Tantra states:

"Beyond extremes” is not apprehending a self in things.

And:

Those of incorrect understanding are the tirthikas i.e. all views grasping to extremes and grasping to a self.

You yourself can carefully study Yoga, Samkhya, Advaita, Nyāyā, Vaiśesika and Mimamsa and compare them with Vaibhaśika, Sautrantika, Yogacara and Madhyamaka as I have done. 

I have done the heavy lifting, why should I do it for you?

But in reality it boils down to this. There are basically two kinds of views among tīrthikas: eternalist and annihilationist. Among those who follow Buddhadharma there are the three realist tenets, Vaibhaśika, Sautrantika (one can include the views of the other Nikaya schools here) and Yogacara (a species of nondual realism), and then there is Madhyamaka, the sublime Middle Way, the crown jewel of the Buddha's teaching. 

The real problem is that people who come to Buddhadharma do not properly study these non-buddhist tenets, and in doing so, often unwittingly import these views into their practice, for example, imagining the basis (gzhi) is something Brahmin and so on, and concluding the Dzogchen, for example, has the same meaning as Advaita. 

As far as rebutting these incorrect views, I have in fact done so for years, at length, in many places.

If there is visualization of oneself as a deity, or you invite a deity in front of you, than this is exactly what yidam practice is. However, he difficulty lies in how this transmission is communicated from one generation to another. If there is no need for empowerment, i.e, if the idea is that one can simply pick up a text, recite mantras, perform mudras, and so on, this really does not qualify.

I appreciate your expression of supporrt, and understood it as such, but in order to prevent confusion these distinctions must be made.

As above, one cannot consider blessing protective amulets as falling under the heading of Vajrayāna practice, much less Yidam deity practice. 

Actually, the term yi dam lha (iṣṭadevatā) is comparatively rare in Indian tantras, is more common in Indian commentaries, while of course it is ubiquitous in Tibetan writing. Nevertheless, my point was that a yidam is a path. That path is not common to common Mahāyāna such as Zen, while of course there is nothing barring anyone from practicing any of the divisions of tantra.

This turn in the conversation is not about Buddhism vs. "Hinduism", it is about the fact that the tīrthikas are not talking about the same thing we are, do not have the same understanding of the basis we do and do not share the same result we achieve, not to mention their path and ours is completely different. 

I understand that you have a different point of view, but I do not agree with your point of view on this score in anyway. 

Quite frankly, all of my studies, with Tibetan lamas fluent in Sanskrit educated by Indian Paṇḍitas in the six darshans at Varanasi and with Hindu teachers, have done nothing but reinforce my conviction that the mountain Hindus are climbing is a complete different mountain than the one the Buddha pointed out that we should ascend. 

When there are discussions about things like the basis, suchness and so on, some people who are incapable of seeing the ultimate distinctions between Buddhist and tīrthika views keep on introducing their confusion into these conversations necessitating again and again a rehash of the same points. Not for them, of course, because they are clearly incorrigible, but for the benefit of those who are beginners or who have not had the benefit of a solid education in Dharma yet.

It's really not the same thing at all. 

Why? Because when it is said there is only one dharmakāya it means that realization of all Buddhas is the same, not that the continuum of all sentient beings is the same; just like saying that the nature of all fires is heat; nevertheless, every buddha's continuum is distinct and separate. This is not the case with Advaita which insists there is only one purusha for everyone, i.e. that the continuum of all sentient beings is the same.

Is there one parātman or many? If there is one, it is transpersonal, if it is many, then what is the difference between Saṃkhya and Advaita? 

In reality, Shankara argues theres is in reality only one purusha, not many, as in the Saṃkhya system. He makes this abundantly clear in his Yogasutra commentary, as did Ramaswami when he taught us the Yoga sutras, confirming everything I thought about Advaita. Also his teacher of Advaita was the Sankaracarya of Kanchi, the old one, Chandrashekarendra Saraswati, not the new one.

I don't think so. Calling these things "tantric" comes from an ignorant and anachronistic use the term from the early 20th century. In other words, the term really has no meaning. There was never any tradition in India that called itself "tantric". There are many traditions in India that followed manuals (tantras), from Ayurveda (in whose texts is found the the earliest use of the term) to Yoga, Kauala, so on and so forth. 

Secret Mantra is something very specific. None of these Thai practices bear any relationship to Secret Mantra.

Āryāṣṭadaśasahasrika-prajñāpāramitā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Dependent origination should be known as emptiness.

Ārya-mahāvajrameruśikharakūṭāgāra-dhāraṇī

Due to being imputed, imputation is also empty. Due to arising from causes and conditions, dependent origination is also empty. Due to being generated by adventitious causes and conditions, production is empty of self. In that respect, dependent origination is empty of intrinsic characteristics. Whatever is empty of intrinsic characteristics is characteristicless. Whatever is characteristicless, that is suchness. Whatever is suchness, that is unmistaken suchness. Whatever is unmistaken suchness, that is isn't anything other than suchness. Whatever isn't anything other than suchness, that is samadhi. Whatever is samadhi, that is realization. Whatever is realization, that is emptiness. Whatever is emptiness, that is sublime insight. Whatever is sublime insight, that is calm-abiding. Whatever is calm-abiding, that is complete freedom [vimokṣa]. Whatever is complete freedom, that is the middle way. Whatever is the middle way, that is without a first limit and without a second limit, cannot be apprehended, is not an apprehender, is not annihilated, is not permanent, does not arise, does not cease, is without thought, is without concept, is not independent, is not dependent, does not come, does not go, is without total affliction, without purification, does not cohere, does not separate, that is sublime insight. Whatever is sublime insight, that is without aggregates, without elements [dhātus], without sense organs, without sense gates [āyatanas], without objects, is not designated as an object, is without karma, without the result of karma —  whatever is without karma and without the result of karma, that is unsurpassed perfect awakening. 

Here we can clearly see the Buddha stating that since dependent origination is empty, it is without characteristics, and whatever is without characteristics is suchness.

There may be nothing Buddhas can do to intervene when sentient beings are blindly acting out of affliction and cause themselves needless injury, nevertheless, even though samsara is a terrible place, it is still possible to generate roots of virtue. All positive things that sentient beings do generate such roots, and the Buddhas teach only virtue, therefore, all positive things that happen to sentient beings are a blessing of the Buddhas because the Buddhas bless all roots of virtue as such. Every teaching, every word, which encourages sentient beings to generate virtue is the word of the Buddha, and it does not matter in which religion or secular philosophy it is found —&nbsp;all of them are the teaching of the Buddha, the ultimate root of such teachings come out of the very basis which gives rise to Buddhahood itself, cultivating the root of virtue and generating compassion for sentient beings. Buddhas have limitless compassion so of course they automatically "wish" the benefit of sentient beings.

Yes, and nevertheless because of our own afflictive and karmic obscurations not only are we unable to see them, but we still continue to suffer. 

For example, a person with jaundice cannot see white things as white, only as yellow and so on. Buddhas offer us the medicine to cure this condition, but if we do not take it, then like the sick person who does not follow their doctor's instructions, then we have only ourselves to blame for not getting well. 

In the end, brendan, we are responsible for our own liberation, there are no Buddhas to lift us out of samsara like mewling kittens being moved to a safe place by mother cat. This does not mean however that Buddhas are not all around us, benefitting us all the time in ways we cannot or will not perceive. 

All harm that comes to us is a result of our afflicted vision. All benefit that comes to us is the blessings of the Buddhas —&nbsp;if we train with this attitude, then our attitude will improve remarkably.

He identified the suffering of change [ vipariṇāmaduḥkhatā] as any pleasant condition such as health, happiness, and so on that was impermanent. Why? So that people could understand what duḥkha was.

Ultimate truth however is just the object of a correct cognition, that is how it is defined, that is all it is. When sentient beings do not have that, they suffer; when they do they don't.

Well, not really, not according to the definition. But you know this, and you have your problems accepting Buddhist teachings and have for years, as anyone who follows your posts knows. 

The idea that our sense cognition are automatically perceptions of "suchness" has been refuted many times by the Buddha in many sutras, so no need to repeat them here.

Any being who is possesses afflictions which causes rebirth in samsara is suffering by definition even if they are experiencing the most intense possible mundane bliss. Why? Because they will inevitably exhaust their merit and take rebirth in lower realms. 

The secret name of the suffering of change is sukha.

They are not my views. In any case, you can also read Kongtrul's Buddhist Ethics, where different approaches to samaya are evaluated and harmonized, but not one claims that one can hold samaya without an HYT empowerment of some kind. Empowerment is the sole entryway to Vajrayāna, this has been proclaimed in one voice by all the scholars of India and Tibet.

Without empowerment, you cannot receive samayas. You need to read Sapan's Three Vows and Tsongkhapa's commentary on the Vajrayānamūlapatti. If you have no samaya, no wisdom protector from the tantras will give you aid, though of course, worldly protectors found in sūtra, etc., will. 

I don't know what exception you are referring to regarding Trijiang Rinpoche.

Dukkha is dukkha, it does not go away with awakening. Even if our dukha vanishes (and it can), there is still the dukha of others —&nbsp;and this the basis of Mahāyāna, the reason why in Mahāyāna there is the notion of a non-abiding nirvana where awakened people do not simply check out in a nirvanic cessation.

No, they will not. If you are not a Vajrayāna practitioner (meaning that you maintained your samaya), they will not even heed you, let alone help you.

Maybe for as long as it takes for an ant to crawl up the bridge of our nose. 

Otherwise, who are we kidding? Well, ourselves for one, and definitely others.  

The reality is that as long as we have impure vision, we are witnessing and experiencing suffering, both of ourselves and others. What is the basis for compassion in every Buddhist practice? The suffering or dukha of sentient beings. Does having pure vision mean having a fantasy about everything being pure? No, even if we have pure vision 24/7 we still must keep in mind that sentient beings including ourselves are under the power of affliction and karma. 

Will we live forever? No. Will we get sick, die, etc. Yes. Will we be suffering? By definition, yes. Even if we are able to go beyond it through meditation, the very fact of conditioned existence is that it is suffering from top to bottom. Dzogchen is not a get out of jail free card. Dzogchen is the path of seeing how ignorance creates this state we live in, and then how to escape it. This is one of the reasons why in Dzogchen the prison metaphor is used so often.

It's no different than sūtra, in this respect. Only the path is different, but not the basic principles, as the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra indicates:

If someone does not dwell in words and does not dwell in names,
that is Prajñāpāramitā,
the transcendent state of buddhahood.

And:

Migrating beings are led with the noose of the method
to prajñā through concrete objects. 
Therefore, it is the Prajñāpāramita.
The vast dhatū of Samantabhadra
arises in the dharmatā of unceasing play. 
The dhātu of prajñā, the transcendent state, 
lacks attachment, the nature of grasping. 
Since it is nonconceptual, it is beyond speech and thought.
For example, like a magical apparition in the sky,
it is said to be free from the Dharma of expression. 

Also the Mind Mirror of Samantabhadra:

Therefore, prajñāpāramitā cannot be spoken of, thought of, or expressed; not arising, unceasing, beyond thought, clearly knowing pure beneficial conduct.

Here is your "Dzogchen tawa"

The generic basis is called “the basis of delusion” [28b]
because of ignorance and contamination.
Further, the object of knowledge itself appears tainted
because memory and thought arise in the mind.
The essence itself is contaminated by concepts
because the grasping aspect of the six minds is unceasing. 
Further, dharmakāya is bound by apprehension
due to being associated with subtle atoms.
Further, luminosity forms traces
due to the impure perception of the four conditions

And:

Having been joined with the ripening of karma, 
one takes bodies good and bad, 
one after another like a water wheel,
born into each individual class.
Having crossed at the ford of self-grasping, 
one sinks into the ocean of suffering
and one is caught by the heart on the hook of the three lowers realms.
One is bound by oneself; the afflictions are the enemy.

Just that nonrecognition is relative truth because it is by definition a false cognition grounded in ignorance. Thus, while pretending to disagree, you actually agree.

This is elementary, this is why the Uttaratantra states:

Wayward common people 
see the opposite of the truth;
while tathāgatas are without proliferation,
unmistaken about how things are. 
Respectively, the impure, the pure and impure, 
and the very pure, 
are called sentient beings, bodhisattvas
and tathāgatas. 



Thus the difference between sentient beings, bodhisattvas and buddhas is their respective insight in the nature of reality, and that is all.

When he presents the Sakya view, it is identical to his presentation in The Madhyamaka Instructional Manual that Harmonizes the Two Traditions. 

So while Khyentse was broadminded, and so on, his own views are in line with the Sakya Gongma.

It depends. Those who follow classical Madhyamaka tend to regard it as a secondary text. The main interpretation of it found in the Uttaratantra is what is followed by most Tibetans. There is a lot of debate about how that former text is to be understood.

This would have to suppose that this thing that is developed can be distinguished from its causes and conditions... and that's not possible, right? That's basic madhyamika.[/qupte]

Buddha notes that he did not invent the Dharma, but that he merely rediscovered it. Causes and conditions were favorable for a Buddha to arises to teach that Dharma, but principles like the 4NT are universal.

Yes, in nonbuddhist schools who suffer from wrong views.

There are many eternalist positions in Chinese Buddhism that would never have come to pass if the Chinese understood the range of nonbuddhist views in India. But because they did not, many of these eternalist doctrines developed with Chinese Buddhism, especially with regards to the tathāgatagarbha teachings.

Wether you are accurately reflecting Chih I's views is another matter altogether but claiming that existence is pure, etc., is laughable and shows that a bit of study of Abhidharma might be in order here.

What I mean is that existence [bhāva] impure, suffering, nonself and impermanent. Seeing the impure as pure and so on is a large part of the fact that sentient beings are caught in samsara. 

So good luck with the conceptual proliferation that existence is purity, bliss, self, and eternal.

Another additional point is that they are the truths of nobles, not noble truths, because this is the truth that all awakened people see regardless of where they are on the path and regardless of which bodhicitta aspiration they have formed.
