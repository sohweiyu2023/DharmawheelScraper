1) Are buddha qualities the same as or different than omniscience? If they are the same, then the elimination of affliction through realizing emptiness free of extremes and attainment of omniscience are the same thing, just as raising a lamp in the dark room dispels darkness that’s been there for 1000 years. 1) if they are different than omniscience, than what are they? Where do they exist in the five aggregates that define a sentient being?

There is no where to go. Blo 'das, beyond mind, simply means one has dropped thought for instant presence, it isn't a state beyond the mind, actually. It does not mean one uses a concept to counteract concepts--that's the path of renunciation and transformation. In the path of self-liberation, concepts have always been liberated in and of themselves since the state of concepts is nonarising. That is what it means to be in the state of ཨ. Deciding to make a sound is certainly is an intention, which is liberated in and of itself, but it is not necessarily working with the mind, for example, when one engages in an analytical investigation for the nature of the mind. The mind and nature of the mind are not mutually exclusive phenomena. When one has not recognized the nature of the mind; mind is in control it seems hard and solid; when one has recognized the nature of the mind, pristine consciousness is in control, because the mind is not hard and solid. For example, if you have tasted a piece of ice, you know that ice melts and becomes water. Even if all the ice is still frozen, you know it is water and you do not have to concern yourself any longer about the nature of ice.

The symbol of AGY is for direct introduction. But when we do AGY, we are reintroducing ourselves, integrating with nondual state of ཨ. It’s the same as SOV. When we sing SOV we are not thinking about the meaning of SOV, though there is a meaning. We are integrating nondually with the sound of SOV as we sing. It’s the same when we do any dzogchen mantra. We are never vusualizing anything or working with the mind at all. When we do AGY, it is the same. It’s not necessary to visualize anything in AGY, tHat’s the point. The symbol is there for explanation, not visualization.

The principle is understanding the indestructible bindu in the heart center is the basis, as it is present in a sentient being. The purpose of all gurus yogas is based on this principle. That bindu is there all the time. We don't create that. It is not like generating a little Padmasambhava in the heart. When we do generation of a little Padmasambhava, or some other deity dissolving into and residing in our heart center, the principle is the same as Ati guru yoga. Ati guru yoga just skips all the gradual steps of finding oneself in instant presence in that state. 

There are many visualization practices in Dzogchen teachings. None of them belong to Anuyoga. There are many visualizations in Anuyoga, very interesting practices for getting into the essence of all nine yānas, but these, while very useful, are not atiyoga practices, per se. 

The real difference is that ati yoga is by definition not based on mind, but rather, pristine consciousness. That means working the radiance of rig pa directly. Ati guru yoga is one way of doing that, and is the main way of doing that in the DC. But in his kindness, ChNN taught so many practices of anuyoga, if people like or require these methods, they are available for people to use. But he always stressed that the main practice is AGY and SOV. So of course, sometimes I do a mahāyoga style guru yoga with Guru Rinpoche, other times, an anuyoga style with Garab Dorje, Vimalamitra, etc. But most of the time I do ati guru yoga, and of course, in the DC, rather than reciting lineage prayers, we always do Ati Guru Yoga first, before we do anything else, because for us, Ati guru yoga is the essence of all the lineages we have received, since it is the state of knowledge to which our gurus, all them, directly or indirectly, have introduced us to. Therefore, in our community, we unify everything in ati guru yoga and yes, this is also what I primarily teach. I don't really see much point in giving transmissions of many deity practices.

The part in red comes from the text you quoted, his final Kalacakra text, the Jewel Lamp. That's why I gave you the page numbers. He is clearly correcting the incorrect usage of the term "gzhan stong," but it is not that profound in the sense that what he is saying is novel. 

The point I am making is that he never accepted gzhan stong view, because it is trivial to say that the afflictions are not inherent to the mind, i.e., that the mind is inherently empty of afflictions, but not empty of its own purity, aka, luminosity. That's the point of his citation about sunrays, that they are inherently pure no matter what they fall on. Luminosity, in sūtra, is just a metaphor for purity. Unforunately, some people take this for being a substantial quality of the mind, and like you, confuse this with the notion that lamps illuminate themselves. Lamps cannot illuminate themselves, because there is no darkness in a lamp to remove. 

Of course this is different in various tantric perspectives, where there is an understanding about how the radiance of this fundamental mind functions with the nadis, vayus, and bindus of the body and can be employed on the path. 

It's also trivial to say that purity has infinite qualities, but some people out of a zeal born of literalism really do get too carried away.

What no longer arises is the mind and mental factors. Gnosis sees suchness. This is not a mind since it is not conceptual. This is also not inert, since it is characterized by clarity. It is ultimate in the sense that its object is ultimate, but it is relative in that it exists in a continuum. Since it is free of afflictions, it is beyond birth and death. But its activity is effortless and not connected with conceptual signs, which both Candra and Maitreyanātha agree on. As far as qualities go, as I have mentioned before, it is not necessary to have truly existing kāyas and wisdoms in the basis in order for the result to manifest qualities of the kāyas and wisdoms. The recognition of reality itself produces these qualities spontaneously. They are not newly created in the sense that they are fabricated; but rather, they are emergent properties of buddhahood, which cannot be inferred from observing sentient beings in their present state. Buddhas, of course see the actual potential of sentient beings, but statements that the buddha-qualities, such as eighteen unshared qualities and so on, exist in sentient beings, cannot be taken literally. But of course, once reality is realized through the personally realized gnosis that arises in equipoise, these qualities naturally emerge, because any being with a mind has the potential to manifest these qualities. For example, no one says that flowers exist in the ground fully formed. But no one denies that seeds exist in the ground. When these seeds meet the spring rain, by July all the flowers are in bloom. Likewise, the minds of sentient beings have the potential to realize reality—if you like the fundamental mind of luminosity, vidyā, etc.—and when they do, they bring forth an abundance of qualities, just as the Buddha has stated. But to take literally the idea that all these qualities exist fully expressed in sentient beings at the time of the basis is a pretty foolish position, since it is obviously the case that sentient beings are not omniscient, do not have the eighteen unshared qualities, and so on.

And we might add, from the MAV:



Since all the dry wood of objects of knowledge are burned up, 
that peace is the dharmakāya of the victors, 
at that time there neither arising nor cessation—
the cessation of the mind is directly perceived by the kāya.

Candra comments on this:


Since the kāya that possesses the nature of gnosis burns all the dry wood of objects of knowledge, since objects of knowledge do not arise, that which possess this nonarising is the dharmakāya of the buddhas. As it is said:

From this perspective 
the buddhas see suchness,
the guides are the dharmakāya,
dharmatā is not an object of knowledge,
that cannot be known. 

This dharmakāya neither arises nor ceases at that time. From this point of view, Mañjuśrī, this "neither arising nor ceasing" is nominal designation for the tathāgata."
 
That being the case, the relative presentation is that only the kāya can directly perceive the object of gnosis, reality, since the mind and mental factors can never engage that as a perceiving subject at all.

First of all, as I have explained to you many timses, the spros bral tradition, the classical tradition of Madhyamaka in India and Tibet (as opposed to  yogacārins who merely claim to madhyamakas but cling to a real basis) is not a rang stong school. 

Back to Rendawa, there is nothing novel about saying that the nature of the mind has never been affected by taints from the very beginning. His whole thrust is distinguishing mind from the nature of the mind, he says, when discussing the cause tantra on page 333, quotes the Bhadrapāla śreṣṭhi paripṛcchā sūtra:

Just as sun rays are not affected by the taints of bad odor, pollution, or even fallen corpses, the sun is free of bad smell without going somewhere else. Likewise, the element of consciousness [vijñānadhātu] is born in wombs of dogs and pigs, who eat shit and garbage, nevertheless, the element of consciousness is never affected by that inferior behavior."

It is perfectly acceptable to say that the mind is devoid of adventitious afflictions, the Buddha states it clearly in the Pabhassara Sutta. It that is all one is confining one's definition extrinsic emptiness to, this is not a source of fault. 

The issue we run into is when we begin to define gnosis as ultimate. So does Rendawa really define gnosis as ultimate in the sense of being substantially different from consciousness? Rendawa, in the passage you cite says:

The two truths presented by the tradition of this tantra are as follows: All the adventitious, impure phenomena produced from the deluded condition of ignorance are obscurations to seeing reality (tattva, de kho na nyid), and because they are the support (ālambana) of affliction, they are relative truth. Because they also are not established as the objects of true gnosis (samyakjñāna), they are intrinsically empty, emptiness of annihilation, and an inert emptiness.

This all makes sense because the point being made here is that the emptiness of the mind itself is not inert, but afflictions and so on, which actually do not exist as such, are indeed empty in the way he describes them. 

All the phenomena of luminosity of the fundamental mind (gnyug ma sems) are are ultimate truth. It is not because it can bear analysis through reasoning...

This is where Rendawa and Jonang part ways. He is not claiming that, in the parlance of the Geluk school, the fundamental mind of clear light can withstand analysis. He is making an entirely different point. What's his point: He cites the Abhidharmasammucaya on this score:

Why is [suchness] called "ultimate?" Because the ultimate is the domain of gnosis. 

Rendawa continues:

As it says, it because it is the domain of the nonconceptual [gnosis], [the luminosity of the fundamental mind] is ultimate, and because it is devoid of adventitious stains, it is empty of other. Because it must be experienced in the manner of individual, personal knowledge (so so rang rig, pratyātma+vit), it is neither an annhilationist emptiness nor an inert emptiness.

It is incisive here that Rendawa makes the distinction the fundamental mind of luminosity cannot bear analysis. He does state that it is the domain of the gnosis that must be personally known (so sor rang gyis rig pa'i ye shes). 

If one is familiar with Sakya works, one also finds Sapan making an observation in Treasury of Reasoning that partless moments are ultimate, and cannot be refuted by madhyamaka reasons. Why? Because madhyamaka only refutes moments with arising, abiding, and cessation. It has no arguments for dealing with partless moments. He also makes a distinction between an ultimate of freedom from extremes and an ultimate of reduction, with these partless moments belonging to the latter. We see the same move here. When reduced, the mind is empty of extraneous taints, as the Buddha states, so no one can argue with this. No one believes that afflictions are inherent to the mind. What Rendawa does not say is that this fundamental mind exists or is permanent, which is the error in which the Jonang seemingly fall, thus the charge of being crypto-Hindus. On page 332 he offers this refutation:

Here, others say, "The basis of purification, suchness with taints, and the result of purification, the vajrakāya, are inseparable in the manner of [one, the result] pervading [the other, the basis], once those are grasped to be the same, the inseparable basis and result are asserted to be permanent, stable, and the same This is totally deluded. The permanent cannot be contaminated by the condition of adventitious impurities, and due to this, also also the path will not be able to make the tainted untainted, because the permanent is unchanging.

The part in red I understand to be Rendawa's continued rejection of the Jonang perspective. So, frankly, I understand his "gzhan stong" to be rather different than yours, the so-called "white" gzhan stong mentioned by HHDL, as opposed to "black" gzhan stong.

If you think that she is implying that Candra is hinting at an ineffable experience, I disagree with her. If you think she is implying that gnosis is ineffable, I agree with her.

The problem here is the lack of definition of “experience.” Is a direct perception an “experience?” We are generally unaware of the majority of direct perceptions we have. Generally, as I understand experience, direct perceptions are mediated by the apprehension and discursive identification of characteristics. What about all the other direct perceptions we have which never rise to the level of being identified? Are they experiences? How can an “object” which has no characteristics, unlike a blue vase, said to be experienced? A fundamental definition is that the ultimate is not a domain of mental experience.  To compound the problem, since pramanas and prameyas are mutually dependent, a valid cognition cannot be established independent of a valid object, and a valid object cannot be established independent of a valid cognition. This mutual dependence renders the notion of establishing object-oriented cognitions as ultimately valid problematic,

The symbol is just a symbol of the potentiality of the basis that exists in the heart center of every sentient beings, with its qualities of sounds, lights, and rays.

Then I guess it is difficult for you, since you think it is difficult. It is not how I was taught. We all take away different things from the teachings, even when we follow the same teacher. Buddha is a perfect example of this phenomenon. There is both a direct way to practice Dzogchen and an indirect way, relying on secondary practices for support. Neither way is wrong. I prefer the former to the latter.

ChNN stressed that there is no such a thing as "pure Dzogchen," contra the ideas of some. On the other hand, he also stressed over and over again that Dzogchen was not just some add-on to Vajrayāna, even though this is how most people in Tibetan Buddhism relate to it. 

Dzogchen is an independent vehicle. He often pointed out that each of the vehicles were independent paths, complete in themselves. For example, everyone understands Śrāvakayāna and Mahāyāna are a complete path. No one says, "To complete the path of śrāvakyāna, you must practice pratyekabuddhayāna, etc., or to complete the Mahāyāna path, you must then practice kriya tantra." Mahāyāna is a complete path, so is kriya tantra.

This does not mean it is invalid for Dzogchen tantras and texts, like the Great Space of Vajrasattva, to point out the deviations and errors of the eight or nine vehicles. Because understanding those deviations and errors is important for discovering one's primordial state and not having doubts.

Gnosis also is not an experiencer. Since (1) gnosis necessarily perceives emptiness, and (2) that [emptiness] has nature of nonarising, as nirvana is not an existent through that nature not existing, and is also not held to be a nonexistent, therefore, the nature of gnosis is beyond all proliferation.

He never says gnosis has a form (rūpam, gzugs) in this passage. He also denies that gnosis is an experiencer. 

Majya states:

Gnosis— the subject (viṣayin, yul can) [which apprehends] the ultimate—does not perceive any signs of proliferation because it does not apprehend [nirvana] to either exist or not exist.

But this gnosis is relative, like all gnosis. Otherwise, one has to theorize a) a separate instrument of knowledge for gnosis, which the Buddha never taught, or b) a transformation of the state of consciousness from being compounded to being uncompounded, as the cittamatrins suggst, which contains an internal contradiction or c) that consciousness itself is ultimate and truly established, contra the Buddha's teachings in their entirety.

Of course it is, it’s present in every major empowerment and blessing. Without it, the example wisdom cannot be induced in the student. What else do you think the fourth empowerment is?

The special point of view of the Dzogchen tradition is that the three lower empowerments are unnecessary, the fourth empowerment alone is sufficient for ripening the student. The four Dzogchen empowerments-elaborate through very unelaborate-are in fact elaborations of the fourth empowerment.

What we call “direct introduction” is just the most simple way of conferring the word empowerment.

There is also something similar in the Kagyu Mahamudra tradition.

So you are equating the citta of Advaita with the ultimate truth in Buddhism? You think Advaita is defensible? 

If there is an experiencing subject, there must be an object. 

For example, what is the object of a nondual equipoise free from proliferation? Is there an object in emptiness which is free from extremes? Can emptiness free from extremes itself be an object of equipoise? How? 

We conventionally term the wisdom (prajñā) that apprehends emptiness free from extremes a "yogic direct perception,"  but this merely a convention, since there is no object that is directly perceived, and thus, no actual direct perception as such. In this state the mind simply subsides through the exhaustion of analytical options and merges into the dharmadhātu. This is not an "experience" per se, since there is neither subject nor object—the mind has become the very image of the dharmadhātu free from all extremes, like the reflection of the blue sky in a still lake. 

The fault of the Gelukpas is turning emptiness into a conceptual object.

[I am putting aside the question of empty forms because it is not applicable, we were talking about madhyamaka, not completion stage practices].

There are five guru yogas in Lama Yanthik (two are basically the same), one long life practice, and one dakini practice, as well as a lengthy Ganapuja connected with the empowerment, but they make up a very small fraction of the 600 or so folios of the whole cycle. 

But most of Lama Yanthig is focused trekchö and thogal.

Of course we always connect our practice with guru yoga. 

But the main point is discovering and then continuing in instant presence. And for that, for example, ChNN has many precise methods, some connected with anuyoga methods, for example Lama Khandro Thugthig, but most are not. 

You like practicing sadhanas, that works for you. But it does not work for everyone, and in this modern age, it is working for less and less people as the age of mantra is slowly coming to an end. And eventually a Dzogchen practitioner has to put sadhanas and recitations down completely.

Longchenpa distinguishes between this kind of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality, with the bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality that arises in instant presence:

Further, the vivid clarity of the state of the naturally abiding mind and the clarity of vidyā that is settled naturally are similar in that they are both clear and nonconceptual. However, since there is a protrusion of subject and object in the mind aspect, there is a slight clinging to calmness. Since there is uninterrupted pellucidity in vidya, this is a huge difference.

You express a lot of doubt about how people in the DC practice and you are very discouraging to others. In general, Dzogchen is not so hard. It does not take nearly as much effort as some people claim it does. Norbu Rinpoche was an extremely encouraging teacher. He never discouraged anyone. He made sure that everyone had the possibility of liberation through Dzogchen teachings, at the very least, liberation in the buddhafields. He didn't believe in the two accumulation model of attaining buddhahood. He told us to discover our primordial state right now, which is already perfect, and if distracted, recognize it again and again and again, practicing Ati Guru yoga constantly day and night, giving ourselves direct introduction constantly. If we have time for more elaborate practices, great. But if not, also no problem. He also said that understanding was more important than meditating--this is key point that differentiates Norbu Rinpoche's approach from other teachers. One won't expose rig pa by meditating sadhanas, etc. Longchenpa is extremely clear about this. If someone has a good understanding, then whatever they do becomes Dzogchen practice. If someone has no understanding, then even practicing Thigle Gyacan or Chetsun Nyinthig will never become Dzogchen practice no matter how many pretty words those sadhanas contain. I know you know this and agree, so lighten up please.

One can drop into rig pa any time with Atiguru yoga. And it is very possible to be in a state of instant presence for the duration of the song of the vajra. I know you think you are being helpful, but you aren't, really. You are just sowing your own doubts in other peoples minds.

No. The locus classicus for Sakya view is a text called rin po che ljon shing by Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen, which is on the abhisamaya of the Hevajra Tantra.

He indeed proclaims that the view of the Hevajra Tantra, freedom from extremes, is higher than Madhyamaka. What is Jetsun's final view in this text? gNas lugs med pa, i.e. "There is no reality." Why? Because nothing can be found by way of an analysis of any of the four extremes in the relative or the ultimate. Since no relative phenomena can be found be means of such an analysis, there is nothing in the ultimate that can be found to exist in any of the four extremes nor in the middle. The Samputa says, "The yogi does not rely on emptiness, nor on nonemptiness, nor on the middle." The Sgra thal gyur states when explaining liberation from extremes (mtha' grol), "Since the extremes are not found, the middle is not found; since the middle is not found, the extremes are not found." 


If you want to say that your infinite, uncompounded qualities exist in the ultimate, the very claim they exist in the ultimate makes you an eternalist because you are claiming something exists in the ultimate, and you are claiming the ultimate exists. The only way out of this problem is to accept that "all phenomena of samsara and nirvana have never existed from the moment they appear" like like illusions, dreams, moons in the water, optical illusions, fairy castles, and emanations.

We’ve already established that all your blather about qualities and so on is just so much verbal hot air to prop up the weak faith of those intimidated by emptiness.

Dolbupa and Geluk view are mirror images, one eternalist, the other annihilationist. This is why the Late Khenpo Appey used to joke that Geluk view was upside down gzhan stong. 

MMK:

“All views of emptiness are a source of error.”

Dolbupa makes exactly the errors Gorampa ascribes to him. No one has ever addressed Gorampa’s objections in Moonrays, either from the Geluk side part (apart from Sonam Thakchoe)  or the Jonang side .

Shakya Chogdan is an interesting character, whiose perspective changed a lot during his lifetime. He wept when Gorampa passed away, and it is said, his final view was that of Rongton and Gorampa. The debates between Gorampa and Shakya Chogden largely concerned Domsum.  

Modern gzhan stong in Kagyu largely depends on Shakya Chogden, not Jonang.

They are both conceptual reificatons, so they are both wrong. So what is the correct Madhyamaka approach? Gorampa continues:

The intelligent common person who investigates reality
also does not reject the proliferation of the four extremes all at once,
but after rejecting the four alternately
by meditating in the proper way, when path of seeing arises
as both the reality which is devoid of the four extremes of proliferation
and the realizing mind are non-dual, 
the mind itself dissolves into the state free from proliferation, 
described conventionally as the view which sees the dharmadhātu. 
There is no difference in the perceived object of realizing the dharmadhātu
in this and the gnosis of a perfect Buddha.
Therefore, it is said “The one discovering the purest gnosis
develops the oceanic mind of the perfect Buddhas.”

As it is explained, when one is freed from the clouds of adventitious stains
by the power of the stream-like meditation of the unification of
the trio of the non-dual mind,
the creation of bodhicitta as stable as Mt. Meru
and the compassion which reaches the limits of space, [47/a]
it is conventionally described as the dawn of the sun of buddhahood.
At that time all consciousnesses and objects of consciousnesses
are nothing other than the nature of that gnosis.

It depends on how that mind is settled and calm, since meditation, as defined by Longchenpa (and following him, Chogyal Namkahi Norbu), is ultimately based on conceptual one-pointedness, and trekcho is not. 

ChNN makes the point that what is necessary is only knowledge of the example wisdom (Upadeśa on the Primordially Pure Tregchöd commentary, pg.90-91) which is based solely on the guru's instructions and the disciple's faith. This is superior to the two stages or analysis, as ChNN states. very clearly.  The Upadeśa on Primordially Pure Tregchöd commentary could not be clearer about this, and duplicates statements made by Longchen in chapter 10 verbatim, though without attribution.

(2) One can practice his unique system of six limb yoga of Secret Mantra, again, combined with Dzogchen view. For example, following one's vows is considered to be pratyāhara-- one sees all the consciousnesses of the sense as fauts, but one does not abandon them. This is considered to render one a container for concentration. Concentration itself is focusing on the three secrets, the deity, mantra, and wisdom. In this context then, the five mental factor associated with concentration manifest. Once the factors of concentration arise, then one practices prāṇāyama, specifically breath retention, which produces different signs during the day and during the night, etc. It is quite detailed and interesting. He concludes, "In brief, also all these different concentrations will be skillful conduct if done in connection with the meaning of Dzogchen, but will be unskillful conduct if not connected."

No one can decide for you if you are someone who needs to practice with effort or without, but since the main point is to nakedly expose rig pa from the beginning, then, we try to achieve this from the beginning. If we succeed in this, then we do not need to follow the path of effort described above. All of these concentrations described by Rongom are considered "meditation" by Longchenpa, and mind-based, and distinct from the unique natural concentration that characterizes nakedly exposing vidyā. 

Claiming however that one can only practice trekcho after realizing emptiness however, is totally in the wrong direction.

I think there was only one, and there are competing histories about the clan Sunakṣatra came from. Tibetan scholars universally state he was the Buddha’s first cousin. The only explicit mention of him by the name Sunakṣatra in the Tibetan canon I’ve been able to find is in the Nirvana Sutra.

No, that is a metaphor for mistake perception, which again, is not an ontological issue. 

For example, the sūtra discusses not understanding the indirect meaning of tathāgatagarbha. If someone takes the idea of infinite, unfabricated, major and minor marks literally existing in sentient beings as ornaments...I have a bridge in Brooklyn.

No, that is not the error it is addressing at all. The error it addresses is not understanding the intentional meaning of words used by the Buddha. It is a sutra about use of language, not ontology.

I dont agree with Brunnhölzl's analysis. All the text really doing is striking a balance against those who assert the Buddha only asserted the absence of self as an ontological commitment. But not even Nāgārjuna makes that claim, in fact he asserts the opposite, i.e., that the Buddha taught both self and not-self, depending on context. That is why the Buddha makes reference to the Middle Way in one passage, at the end of along a reply to Mañjuśrī, where he states that some do not understand the indirect (ldem po. saṃdhāya) meaning of liberation, self, and transcendence (lokottara).

This is a facially false statement. In any case, this sutra is not talking about definitive nature of emptiness. Angulimāla is talking only about "freedom from the condition of the afflictions and their effluents." His grasp of Jain siddhānta leaves much to be desired.

That's not the whole story here, that emptiness is also implicitly dependent on an object, from the same sutta, in this case wilderness on up to the six āyatanas absent of affliction, desire for birth, and ignorance:

Consider this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. It’s empty of elephants, cows, horses, and mares; of gold and money; and of gatherings of men and women. There is only this that is not emptiness, namely, the oneness dependent on the mendicant Saṅgha. In the same way, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of the village and the perception of people—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness. Their mind becomes eager, confident, settled, and decided in that perception of wilderness. They understand: ‘Here there is no stress due to the perception of village or the perception of people. There is only this modicum of stress, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’ They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of the village. It is empty of the perception of people. There is only this that is not emptiness, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’ And so they regard it as empty of what is not there, but as to what remains they understand that it is present. That’s how emptiness is born in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure...They understand: ‘Here there is no stress due to the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, or ignorance. There is only this modicum of stress, namely that associated with the six sense fields dependent on this body and conditioned by life.’ They understand: ‘This field of perception is empty of the perception of the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.There is only this that is not emptiness, namely that associated with the six sense fields dependent on this body and conditioned by life.’

This is not an ontological statement, it is a mere observation that even when the all afflictions cease, there is still a body in samsara, until the aggregates break up.

Title: Re: Buddha's three sons (?)
Content:
According to the Tibetan Vinaya, King Śuddhodana had four siblings, one whom was Śuklodana, and it is held that the latter had two sons, one called rGyal (Puṣya) and the other was a prince of the Śākyas called bZang ldan, 

Tibetan sources such as Yang chen Gawey Lodo (dbyangs can dga' ba'i blo gros, 1740-1828) states in his Commentary on the Treatise of the Wise and Foolish that Sunakṣatra was the son of this man  Śuklodana. His proper name was Puṣya (rgyal) or Sunakṣatra because he was born on the conjunction of Pusỵa and Thursday, which considered very auspicous. So in this case, it is held Sunakṣatra was a Śakyan, and the first cousin of the Buddha.
