Only the most average of Dzogchen practitioners take birth in the natural nirmanakāya buddhafields. They have left samsara behind forever. 

IN order to understand the different grades of rebirth in Sukhavati, you would have to read the long Sukhavati sūtra. However, as I pointed out above, that sūtra is not read in Tibetan Buddhism. 

Realizing emptiness in Dzogchen means realizing the original purity of all phenomena, in common with the perfection of wisdom sūtras, etc., and the naturally perfect nature of all phenomena. Like Chan and Zen, paths and stages as described in the sūtras are pretty irrelevant in Dzogchen teachings.They exist, but only to cater to a conventional understandings of the notion of "progress."

Reciting Nembutsu, like reciting Namu Myorenge Kyo, is a virtuous activity, most certainly. Having faith in Amitabha has benefit. But arguing that sūtrayāna practices such as Pure Land practice, etc., are quick paths to buddhahood is is erroneous and cannot be supported on the basis of their own fundamental texts.

Three Pure Land Sūtras, BDK, pp. 59

In general, the sutra itself offers a carrot and stick approach. Sukhavati is the carrot; but you cannot get there without being a good Dharma practitioner, practicing the path of renunciation. Not only this, but the small sūtra makes it clear that this devotional practice should occur in the week before one's death, hence the reason why most Pure Land practice in Tibetan Buddhism is taken up at the end of a person's life. And finally, as stated above, the merit of Dharma practice in this Sahaloka far surpasses the merit of Dharma practice in Sukhavati.

That does not mean he did not attend retreats in other places where I was absent. Some of ChNN's students from the '80s faded away in the early nineties, found other teachers more to their liking, etc. ChNN taught over 600 retreats during his lifetime.

So yeah, Sukhavati is a slow path according to Sūtrayāna norms and a human perspective.

Content:
To put it succinctly, the reason we have four empowerments in HYT is that we have what are called the four mandalas: the nāḍīs, nāḍī syllables, bindu, and vāyu. 

The dependent origination of the human body begins with the ālayavijñāna mounted upon what is known as the "great prāṇavāyu" merging with the reproductive material of a male and a female. The mind is not differentiable from the vāyu (aka winds or airs) in any meaningful way. Thus, the newly formed zygote is shaped through the internal movement of vāyu/mind and its movement forms nāḍis in the body, which are in the form of syllables, filled with bindus, that are propelled by vāyu over the process of human gestation. 

The shape of our body, our perception of the world, our thoughts, afflictive disposition and so on is largely governed by this anatomy. So, to recap: based on conception there is the mandala of vāyu; based on the reproductive material of the parents, there is the mandala of bindu. Based on the formation of knots (grantha) in the naḍīs, there are syllables. And finally, based on the full development of the human body there is the external structure of the nāḍī system, which one should understand as the arteries, blood vessels, and nervous system in the human body, These nāḍīs contain the other three elements, the syllables, bindus, and vāyus. The four empowerments are the purifier of the basis purification, these four mandalas. If we fail to attain buddhahood during the empowerment, then we have the method of practicing sadhanas with the creation and completion stage. The creation stage has two parts: the outer creation stage and the inner creation stage. The outer creation stage purifies afflictions of our bardo experiences, conceptions, gestations and deaths from beginningless lifetime, and all the activities of daily life, eating, sleeping, wearing clothes, sex, etc. The inner creation acts as a purifier for the four mandalas described above. However, creation stage is not sufficient for buddhahood, though it is sufficient for awakening on the impure bhumis. For buddhahood, one needs to practice the completion stage practices with its prāṇāyāma practices, sexual yogas [which frankly are a lot of work and not really that erotic], etc., because the creation stage is largely a conceptual samadhi framework, unifying appearance and emptiness, while the completion stage is what takes one beyond mind with nonconceptual samadhi of clarity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and great bliss and emptiness, also known as the connate. The completion stage is how one enters the state called sahajajñāna or mahāmudra. 

Cakras in the body are places where arteries, nerves, and blood vessels all work together to produce various major functions in the body: the brain for example is understood to govern sense cognition, hence it is called the mahasukha cakra, the cakra of great bliss. The throat cakra governs speech, swallowing, and so on, hence it is called the sambogacakra. The heart cakra governs consciousness and circulation, hence it is called the dharmacakra; the navel cakra governs metabolism and the development of the body, hence it is called the nirmanacakra, and there is another mahāsukha cakra in the genital region that governs reproduction. 

The crown cakra represents the nirmankāya and is the basis for its realization; the throat cakra represents the sambhogakāya and is the basis for its realization. The heart cakra represents the dharmak̄ya and governs it realization. The navel cakra represents the svabhavakāya, and governs its realization. The four empowerments condition these four cakras and plant the seed of the four kāyas in them. 

The knots formed in the nạ̄dīs because of our karma and affliction govern how we perceive the world. For example, there is a nāḍī in the body, which, if one's vāyu gets "stuck" there, will cause one to experience the world as a preta experiences the world. The idea here is that all of our experience of the six lokas is actually predicated on our bodies and how it is formed. Therefore, the way to prevent rebirth in the six lokas is to purify all causes for rebirth in the six lokas through understanding the dependent origination of the body. 

All of our beginningless past-life samsaric experience is actually stored in our present physical form, which is the expression of traces of karma and affliction. Therefore, the Buddha has taught us that the fastest way to eliminate all karma and affliction as well as is traces is to use the body as our method. Not only that, but through the use of physical bliss, and various types of prāṇāyāma, one can rapidly induce profound samadhis that in sūtric contexts take not only years to develop but lifetimes, because the process of advancing on the paths and stages over many lifetimes corresponds to a bodhisattva taking birth in more and more refined bodies until such bodhisattvas cease taking birth in upper half of the desire realm at all after the eighth bhumiu is realized. This process of constant rebirth is bypassed in Vajrayāna, because in Vajrayāna one works directly with the dependent origination of the body inwardly, not outwardly. It is for this reason that Vajrayāna asserts its superior ability to lead a superior practitioner to full buddhahood, characterized as freedom and omniscience, within a single lifetime. Rather than predicating its practice on renunciation; Vajrayāna predicates its approach on transformation; therefore, Vajrayāna practitioners do not need to abandon using meat, alcohol, sexual activity, etc., as they must in common Mahayāna. These activities are all transformed in the context of the sadhana practice. The process of attaining buddhahood is based on the increasingly subtle states of samadhi which are cultivated in each of the completion stage practices, which are connected with the process of straightening the knots of the nāḍīs, then purifying the bindus, and finally, working with the vāyu mandala in the end. The samadhi associated with these three stages of completion practice are increasingly more subtle. While a consort, whether physical or visualized, is not necessary for the first of these three phases, in many Vajrayāna systems it is argued that one is needed for the final two phases of completion stage practice if one is to attain buddhahood in this life. Also the consort has to be the same level of practitioner as oneself. For example, an unawakened bodhisattva cannot have an awakened consort, and vice versa. Some Vajrayānas systems however claim that such a consort is not needed at all. So there are some arguments about this issue. 

Thus, the whole point of this kind of HYT practice, to put it plainly, is to reverse dependent origination of the body/mind complex in toto through practices that are directly based on the anatomy of the human body, understood through how it develops in the process of gestation.

If you have had a chance to read Van Schaik's book, Tibetan Zen, it is pretty clear that there were Chan Buddhists in Dun Huang who were interested in the Vajayāna systems that were being promulgated in Tibet. What is equally interesting to note, is that they were pretty clear on the differences between the two systems and did not seek to conflate them. 

The term "direction introduction" is a term that was coined by Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche as a translation of "rang ngo thog du sprad." As a translation, the term really only translates "thog tu sprad." "Rang ngo" literally means "one's face." Sprad pa means "to introduce" in the sense of meeting (sprod) face to face (ngo). So whose state or face is one being introduced to? One's face (rang ngo). 

In Kagyu Mahāmudra, the term ngo sprod, usually translated in their texts as "pointing out" is used. While the term ngo sprod is used in all schools for introduction, not all introductions are the same. Some are very gradual, like Karma Kagyu Mahāmudra. Others, like Dzogchen direct introduction, or literally Introducing one's own state (literally "face") are sudden. But also these kinds of sudden direct introductions also exist in Mahāmudra, since Mahāmudra, like Dzogchen, is a path of self-liberation (rang grol). Mahamudra is often introduced more gradually than Dzogchen in general, but it is actually a cig car ba, or sudden entry path like Dzogchen, and like Dzogchen, can be introduced immediately. Really, the main difference between Mahāmudra and Dzogchen is that the former is based on the tantras and dohas of the 9th and 10th century mahāsiddhas, and Dzogchen is based on the tantras and dohas of 7th and 8th century mahāsiddhas. I suppose some would like to argue that Chan is based in the teachings of a 5th century mahāsiddha, Bodhidharma. 

Just a note about your experience with Tulku Orgyen—in general, this kind of introduction is the basis of the path. In Dzogchen teachings, one starts there. The experience discovered in that introduction is taken as the basis, upon which the student then works with the teacher to gain confidence in the experience of the introduction. Though Dzogchen is a part of secret mantra, early Nyingmapa authors like Rongzom make it extremely clear that those who did not understand or grasp the introduction right away may practice either mantra practices or regular śamatha and vipaśyanā combined with Dzogchen view. This is known in Dzogchen teachings as the indirect path. 

Further, having received introduction, one is then permitted to use various methods to stabilize one's experience of introduction.  But the key point is that in order to begin the Dzogchen path, or even general secret mantra, one must receive direct introduction in the beginning. 

Thus, upon receiving direct introduction, one is then authorized to engage in many practices which are used to stabilize the experience of the introduction; and in fact serve as a means where the student then becomes responsible for directly encountering their own state (rang ngo thog du sprad). So, while direct introduction is the entry way into the path of Dzogchen teachings and some people get it right away (but such people are rare as stars in the daytime), if the average person does not cultivate the experience of direct introduction somewhat systematically, then Dzogchen remains something like a fantasy. 

When we come to regular secret mantra, in Path and Result system of the Sakyapa, before one can even begin to meditate on the so-called creation stage, one is to meditate on what is known as the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. Without going into detail, the point is that one is using the experience of the introduction during the four empowerments as the basis for cultivating the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. This view is not an intellectual view, but is the recognition and equipoise in a moment of unfabricated consciousness, sometimes referred to as "ordinary mind" (tha mal gyi shes pa). Then, having stabilized the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, one is considered qualified to move onto creation and completion stage practices. Parallel to this is the pervasive practice of guru yoga, which is also predicated in the direct introduction found in major empowerments or alternately, in Dzogchen direct introductions. Here, the point is fundamentally the same, the recognition and equipoise in a moment of unfabricated consciousness. Preliminary even to these practices, in the Sakya system one is supposed to practice quite a bit of yantra yoga and prāṇāyāma before even beginning to mediate the view  of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, though this approach is seldom followed in modern times. 

One important point we should not overlook is that this "ordinary mind" is really the same point being addressed in Dzogchen trekchö, the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, mahāmudra, and so on. The basis for cultivating this ordinary mind is nothing other than some kind of introduction where the teacher uses specific experiences to guide to student to encounter their own state. Such experience of introduction is absolutely crucial, because even if the student did not grasp the introduction at the time it was given, they were guided in this experience and this experience (which could be either physical bliss, clarity, or nonconceptuality) is used as the springboard for students to encounter their own state directly. Very intelligent people, like Mañjuśṛīmitra, Śṛī Simha, etc., can understand the meaning of Dzogchen merely through symbols. Knowledge about this kind of Dzogchen transmission is preserved mainly in the teachings called the Vajra Bridge, connected with the so-called "space series." 

Thus, as far as I know, based on what people who have trained in Rinzai Zen in Japan for many years during the 1960's and who have also practiced in Gelug, Sakya, and Kagyu, and Nyingma, this system of direct introduction does not exist in modern Zen. But is possible their training was not very complete. 

It also did not exist in the 9th century, when Nubchen Sangye Yeshe wrote his Illuminating the Eye of Samadhi (bsam gtan mig sgron), where he systematically goes through gradualism, sudden entry (Chan), Mahāyoga, and Dzogchen. This is why I have been saying that Chan/Zen is sutric, not because I think sūtra is bad or inferior, but because the method of entry in sūtra and tantra are quite different, and the method of entry of the latter is not found in the former. Not only do we have direct introduction in Tibetan Vajrayāna, but this system exists in the highest levels of Shingon, where I have been informed, the final abhiṣeka rite one undergoes in one's training is called the "formless abiṣeka." We also have the example our Matylda, who asserted some years ago on this forum, that in Soto Zen, at the higher levels of training in Japan, there are also Mikkyo rites which are not shared outside the inner circles of the highest ranks of Shingon priests, which she related were the highest teachings in that school. The presence of such methods in Rinzai would not surprise me in the least. But the key point here, with respect to Shingon and Soto, is that these methods are drawn from the tantras, not sūtra. 

The lack of documentation of such methods in Soto and Rinzai, apart from anecdotal accounts from you and Matylda tend to confirm my teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche's opinion, which is that modern Zen has been very influenced by Vajrayāna Buddhism. He even went to so far once as to opine that he thought that Zen had been directly influenced by Dzogchen teachings. For example, we have a Tibetan Dzogchen master, Aro Yeshe Jungney, who lived at the end of the tenth century and into the 11th, who is said to have combined the teachings of Hashang Mohoyen with Dzogchen, though it is not completely certain he interacted with any Chinese teachers directly. On the other hand, even though it is claimed in late historical documents that Chan Buddhism was exiled from Tibet, the reality of it is that disciples of Chan Buddhist masters in Tibet very likely continued to practice Chan alongside Vajrayāna until Chan was really brought into disrepute in 11th century polemical writings like the Testament of Ba, which is one of the sources for the Samye Debate. And we have the Chan sayings of a few Tibetan Chan masters preserved in Nubchen's text. 

However, I am pretty certain that such methods were not present in Tang Dynasty Chan prior to arrival of Esoteric Buddhism to China in the mid 8th century, at the same time Vajrayāna Buddhism was being transmitted to Tibet.  

Unfortunately, in Tibetan Buddhism, empowerments and so on have become so rote and routine, teachers often do not make this point about direct introduction clear to their students, and the Gelugpas, following Sakya Pandita, even reject the system of direct introduction all together as a sufficient introduction to Vajrayāna. 

So, these are the reasons why I say what I said about Chan etc., above, and I also recognize that nothing human beings do remains fixed and static, as much as we pretend that Dharma teachings are "brought down from the mountain" like the ten commandments or the Quran, never to be altered or questioned.

There are some similarities between Chan rhetoric and Dzogchen rhetoric. But the important difference identified by Nubchen is direct introduction. All the people I have met, who have done extensive Zen practice (quite a few who have gone through koan practice under Maizumi Roshi and others), agree that direct introduction as practiced in Vajrayāna does not exist in Zen. Apart from having done a weekend sit with the now-disgraced Eido Roshi when I was 16, I have no personal experience with Zen, and I am sure any Zen master would kick me out for being lazy, obstreperous, and arrogant. 

Another important distinction is that in sūtra based system, there is no explanation of what is termed lhun grub, sometimes is translated as spontaneous presence, self-perfected, and so on, but these English translation do not really get at the meaning.

I agree, which is why I rarely discuss Chan or Zen. 

But when people make statements wondering what all the fuss is about, it is useful to consider the perspectives of Tibetans, like Nubchen, who trained in Tang-era Chan as well as Vajrayāna during the late 8th and the 9th century, both in Tibet, as well as the fertile and ecumenical environment of Dunhuang. While the Chan they encountered is certainly not the same as the Post-Song era school of Rinzai to which you belong, they are related and so their accounts are of interest to those who wish to understand the overall differences, claims. and counterclaims, made  by its various adherents. 

Anyway, thanks for your input, always valued.

Correct. This is acknowledged. But as above, you are describing this in terms of a result to obtain through a cause. A result is a result, whether obtained gradually or suddenly, and it is obtained from a cause, whether gradually or suddenly, whether through a process of gathering the two accumulations over eons or a sudden flash of intuition. Then of course, even if one has this sudden flash of intuition, without the guidance of teacher one will not be able to ascertain whether this gradual attainment or sudden intuition is the real deal. In this respect, there is no difference between Vajrayāna in general and Chan. Both systems depend on a teacher. The principle difference is that in the case of the former, the interested student is first introduced to their own state by the teacher; in the case of the latter, the teacher confirms for the student they indeed have had a proper intuition of the nature of the mind.

It's baked in. Chan, like all other sūtra traditions, lacks direct introduction. This is why Nubchen assigns Chan to a position inferior to Mahāyoga, while at the same time, elevating it above the gradualist approach of Kamalashila, and extensively cites Bodhidharma and more than 40 Tang Chan masters, to show how it is that Chan is superior to the gradualist approach of Kamalashila. 

We also know that concurrently in India, there was a sutric sudden awakening approach that owed nothing to Chan, memorialized in a text by Vimalamitra called The Meaning of Nonconceptual Meditation, the Sudden Approach (cig car 'jug pa rnam par mi rtog pa'i bsgom don). Unsurprisingly, the first text is cited in defense of this is the Lanka Sūtra.

This is important, because the six causes and four conditions are treated in Mahāyāna sūtra and tantras, as well as in such diverse literatures as Tibetan Medicine and even explanations of delusion of sentient beings in Dzogchen teachings.

In Indian literature, the Trikāya doctrine emerges out of the sūtras associated with the Yogacāra school. The doctrine seems to have been formalized by Maitreyanātha and Asanga. 

In pre-Yogacāra Buddhism, there were only two kāyas: dharmakāya and rūpakāya. 

In pre-Madhyamaka/PP Buddhism, there was only one kāya mentioned, dharmakāya, that referred to collected words of the Buddha. 

The reason there is so much confusion about the three kāyas is that most Buddhists have a revelatory view of the sūtras, assuming eternal doxologies. 

But if you study the sūtras layer by later, looking for terms in texts, checking the dates of translations in the Chinese Canon, and so on, you can arrive a pretty accurate picture of the sedimentary layers of Classical Indian Mahāyāna, which then went on to inspire Buddhists in Central Asian, China, and so on.

Astus: this is grouping of creation and completion stages under the rubric of śamatha and vipaśyanā is a kind of Lam rim politics. However, it does not correspond to the actual structure of the two stages. For example, all creation stage practices begin with dissolution into śūnyatā, which of course is based on having insight into emptiness as a prerequisite. 

There are many methods related to mantra recitation, maṇḍala offerings, guru yoga, samaya, mudras, homavidhi and so on, nāḍis, vāyus, bindus, cakras, postural yogas, prāṇāyāma, abhiṣeka as introduction to the path, rather than sign of attaining the result, and so on. You will find none of these methods mentioned in sūtra, apart from the term "mantra," maṇḍala, and abhiṣeka in very limited contexts. 

Also the bliss mentioned in the dhyānas, one of the five mental factors associated with the first dhyāna, etc., is not the bliss being referred to in Vajrayāna texts. This bliss here being referred to is physical bliss of the sense organs.

Bodhidharma was associated with the Lanka Sūtra. Chan is a sutra-based tradition. This does not mean that it necessarily predicated itself on a specific text, but it is upadeśa tradition of sūtric Mahāyāna. The difference between Chan and the kind of late common Mahāyāna we find in Tibetan Buddhism is that Chan is based on definitive Mahāyāna sūtras, whereas, the gradualism that gained political ascendence during the Imperial period was based on provisional sūtras. 

VAn Schaik's Tibetan Zen has a very interesting discussion of the overlap between Vajrayāna and Chan in Dunhuang.

Our world system is located in the palm of his hand. All universes are located in his body. Sometimes this Buddha is referred to as the mahāsambhogakāya.

Because they do not cover all cases, including exceptions, and people will fault you for not covering the exceptions. For example, if I generalize from my Tibetan Buddhist tradition, other people are likely to object. 

For example, I often generalize that that Sino-Japanese Buddhism, apart from Shingon, is sūtra-based Buddhism. This is met with some dismay from Zen people, who, predictably, hotly deny that sūtras are not important in Zen, etc., etc.

Perhaps Vajrayana is more realistic about the human condition than renunciation-oriented forms of Buddhism. it’s origin story, after all, involved an Indian king with 500 wives whom he was obligated to service, so the Buddha taught him a method where he would not have to abandon sense objects, but rather, employ them on the path.

In the Gelug school, meditation on emptiness is an analytical meditation which begins by searching for the inherent existence of a given thing. It is part of the vipaśyanā phase of their system. When this absence of inherent existence, aka emptiness, is discovered conceptually, the practitioner is supposed to cultivate this emptiness conceptually. One of the famed sequences of this sort of analytical meditation, as it is termed in Gelug, is the seven-fold deconstruction of a cart. 

The Gelugpas make a very big deal over what Tsongkhapa termed, "identifying the object of negation." This involved identifying both a subtle as well as a coarse object of negation. The object of negation Tsongkhapa favored is the so-called subtle object of negation, inherent existence. The other object of negation is called the coarse objection of negation, existence, and so on, the so-called four extremes. Tsongkhapa does not like this approach, because he feels it involves an over-negation, and can harm conventional truth, and so on. 

So when Gelugpas say they are meditating on emptiness, what they mean is that they are meditating on "the nonexistence of the true existence, which is the emptiness of inherent existence." This is also what it means for Gelugpas to say that it is proper to meditate on emptiness as a conceptual object, because they hold that this conceptualized emptiness, the absence of inherent existence, is functional simulacrum of the emptiness which is realized in an ārya's equipoise and leads to that realization when properly meditated upon.

The Buddha nowhere mentions sex work as sexual misconduct. Independent, unmarried people are free to do as they wish. If people are in polyamorous relationships, they are also free, since it is all consensual. 

As I pointed out, Āmrapālī was one of the Buddha's direct disciples, and he gave several teachings at her place while she was still working as a courtesan. 

And, it is held in the Candamahārośana Tantra that the farm girl who restored the Buddha to health with rice milk was in fact his consort. 

And in general, in Vajrayāna, sexual activity is taken into the path, not renounced or avoided. So yes, even porn stars can be good Buddhists if they choose. 

Porn is like booze: every one watches it, everyone enjoys it in some form or another, and everyone complains it is "bad."

Thus, your assertion that this Nyingmapa holds that it is proper to meditate on emptiness as a conceptual object is mistaken.

In fact, the withdrawals symptoms of heroin never killed anyone, unlike alcohol detox, barbiturate withdrawal, etc. 

Cocaine is also super-bad news, as is meth, but efforts to curb these drugs clearly are not working. So, decriminalize them too.

The other problem is that police departments regularly exclude people who are intelligent, because they are afraid intelligent people will not like the boredom of being a patrolman. There was a case in Boston where a guy was basically refused a job with the Boston Police department because his scores were too high and he did too well at police academy. 

Everyone I know from high school who became a cop was either a bully or a quiet sociopath. 

Which brings up another point -- psych evaluations and epidemiological studies on police violence as well as gun violence in general——&nbsp;both of which the CDC (now being run by a quack) is forbidden by law from studying. 

And weed, got to stop arresting black and brown people for weed-- need to legalize it, and decriminalize all drugs. The militarization of the police is directly linked to war on drugs, which we never were going to win (which everyone always knew).

The standard definition provided by everyone:

that continuum changes into three aspects;
distinguished by basis,
its nature and inalienability.
The aspect of nature is the cause,
the basis is “method”,
likewise, inalienability is the result;
these three summarize the meaning of tantra."

There is the wisdom derived from hearing; the wisdom derived from reflection, and the wisdom derived from meditation. AFAIC, wisdom is the best English term for prajñā. As a professional translator of Buddhist texts, who does nothing but sit around and think about these issues all day long, I am pretty sure wisdom is the best equivalent for prajñā in general. 

If you follow how Vasubandhu defines prajñā, it is primarily the faculty of analytical discernment. It is also one of the ten neutral mental factors. 

It appears you are using the term in one of its Mahāyāna senses, i.e., the sixth perfection, prajñāpāramitā, transcendent wisdom. But there wouldn't be any need for a perfection of wisdom if wisdom is "something far more direct/meditative." I still think you are conflating prajñā with jñāna, since the latter, unlike prajñā, is in fact direct intuition in the philosophical sense of the term, where as prajñā is principally analytical.

The distinctions between provisional and definitive teachings have two major sources: Akṣayamatinirdeśa Sūtra, and the Samdhinirmocana. Madhyamakas follow the former while Yogacārins follow the latter. The Indian Madhyamaka approach is that if it is about emptiness, absence of identity, etc., it is definitive, everything else is provisional. The Samdhinirmocana seems to assert that its own class of sūtras are definitive because they purport to resolve controversies over the meaning of the Prajñāpāramita sūtra and so on. 

In Tibet, the tathāgatagarbha sūtras are either provisional or definitive depending on how they are interpreted, and how closely one follows Candrakīrti, who clearly follows the Lanka in regarding tathagātagarbha as an expedient teaching. Despite some pushback by some Tibetan interpreters of Yogacāra, Candra's presentation of Madhyamaka is universally regarded as the definitive expression of Madhyamaka in Tibet.

If you examine the available literature in Tibetan translation on the subject, we find that for example, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, etc., devote virtually no time at all to explicating the distinction between the three turnings of the wheel, which itself is given a single passage in the Sandhinirmocana Sūtra. And Maitreyanatha seems to dismiss the idea of the three turnings being successive in the first pages of the Sūtra-laṃkara. 

By contrast, Won-ch'uk, a disciple of Xuantsang, by contrast treats the theme extensively in his three volume Āryagambhīrasaṃdhinirmocanasūtraṭīkā ((D 4016). 

Of the Indian authors represented in the bstan 'gyur, where they give chronologies of the teachings, they tend to do so principally in commentaries on the tantras.

"Emptiness" is perfectly fine for śūnyatā, which after all, means zero in Indian mathematics. The implication is that compounded and uncompounded phenomena are hollow, devoid of substance, insubstantial, evanescent, illusory, etc. 

Karma depends on context, when referring to the doctrine, best left as karma; but when it can be translated as action, it should be. Karuna has the same semantic range as compassion.

Indian Buddhists were completely unimpressed with Sutric Descriptions of different schemes and divisions of the sutras into time periods of the Buddha’s life. They betray very little interest in such claims. But Chinese Buddhists were very interested in such schemes, in trying to make sense of this foreign religion. The Tibetan Buddhist ideas about the three turnings [ rejected in Sakya, however] too are entirely dependent on Chinese Yogacara, not the Yogacarabhumi, etc.

It’s definitely true that the snapshot of Indian Buddhism that Tibetans took was later than the largely  Central-Asian filtered Buddhism which had the most influence on Chinese Buddhism.  But, for  example, Zi yi’s interpretation of the four siddhantas owes nothing observable to Indian Buddhism, nor his fivefold division of Buddhist texts, etc. I personally think part of the reason for this difference between the two is that Chinese Buddhism suffered a severe setback in 845, when it was nearly completely purged from China, as did Tibetan Buddhism, with the assassination of Langdarma in 841. And the greatest flowering of Chinese Buddhist thought took place after the fall of the Guptas in 495. This 250 year period is arguably the high point in Classical Chinese Buddhism. At the same time, Indian Buddhism was on institutionally shaky ground, recovering from the invasion of the white Huns and under increasing pressure from hostile Hindu Kings; and during the last 100 years of this period, Central Asian Buddhism was being encroached upon by Muslims. By the 11th century, Buddhist text translation into Chinese was increasingly rare.

I would say that while Zhiyi certainly took inspiration from Indian sources, his exegetical methodology is unique, more like Huayen than Sanlun, for example.

No, that is not the point. Of course Tibetans, like the Chinese, have doctrinal concerns removed from what Indian Mahāyāna Buddhists cared about.

First of all, Vajrayāna is Mahāyāna. The principle difference between common Mahāyāna and Uncommon Mahāyāna Secret Mantra is methodology. However, these distinctions are Indian. East Asian Buddhists have a whole different scheme that was arrived at in China and Japan, not India. That does not mean they are ipso facto invalid. Another issue is that Indian Mahāyāna survives only in Tibetan Buddhism, where it is taught for theory, but not for practice. For practice, Tibetan Buddhists teach various types of Vajrayāna practice. 

Indian Mahāyāna is not really taught in Chinese Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhists have developed an independent understanding of Mahāyāna which is very distinct from Indian Mahāyāna. Nevertheless, there are certain fundamental commonalities since all Mahāyāna traditions are based on Mahāyāna sūtras.

You already have enough to do with practicing rushan, etc. These are the preliminary practices for thogal and the enhancement practices for trekcho. Further, while the four visions do occur in longde, Longde texts do not explain the theoretical side. So you should make effort to listen to Lama Chonam's lung of the Tshog don mdzod. That text as the complete theoretical foundation you are looking for. When Norbu Rinpoche gave transmission, he did not just give transmission for one series of Dzogchen or another. He gave a unified transmission. But the instructions for all three series need to be sought out separately. And in the case of Longde, also the Ngondzog Gyalpo empowerment is required.

Pehar Gyalpo's origins are far from certain. However, in general, based on traditional accounts, we can understand he first resided in Bengal, later moved to Bhata Hor (the Central Asian Uighur Turks of the Orkhon Uighur Empire (745 – 840)), and thence to Samye. It is important to keep in mind that the Uighur Turks were a) enemies of the Tibetans in the 7-9th centuries, and b) followed Tengrism, Buddhism and Manichaeism, with the last being the official religion of the Bhata Hor from 762 onwards.  

A popular tale, which my own teacher told me, was that when Guru Rinpoche was involved in taming the spirits of Tibet, there was a young monk in the audience at Samye who asked Guru Rinpoche what frightened him most. Guru Rinpoche replied "sdig pa." (misdeeds). The next day, Guru Rinpoche encountered a massive scorpion (sdig pa, same spelling, different meaning), at which Guru Rinpoche manifested as the wrathful guru, Guru Drakpo, seized the scorpion by its tail, and threatened to smash its head with his vajra. Given that the Tibetans were at war with the Uighur Turks at this time, this could also be interpreted as symbol of Tibetan martial prowess in Central Asia. But given how little we actually know about

There are only two streams of Dzogchen transmission in Tibet: kama and terma. On the Buddhist side of things, so-called sems sde and klong sde are kama, long lineage. On the terma side of things, there is man ngag sde, the pinnacle of which is the 17 tantras. 

In Bon, on the "kama" side of things there is ZZNG, everything else is terma.

While certainly one can find pre-Buddhist Tibetan myths woven into various Buddhist mahayoga,  anuyoga, and atiyoga tantras of the ancient tradition, the influence of Iranian religion on the actual doctrinal content of Dzogchen teachings is minimal at best. The reverse cannot be said of the Bon tradition, where the influence of Indian religion on Bon is overwhelming. 

I personally do not believe there is any evidence at all which indicates the ZZNG is pre-Buddhist. This does not mean I discount the teachings of the ZZNG, since they are very interesting and more or less the same in meaning as the Buddhist Dzogchen teachings, using similar language, concepts, anatomy and so on. But the borrowings from the Buddhist tradition are very obvious and cannot be ignored.

ChNN said lots of things and it is easy to cherry pick this and that. 

But the man ngag sde tantras and commentaries are very clear that there are many adherents of sems sde are following a path of mind rather than ye shes. ChNN has also pointed out that no one obtains rainbow body through sems sde alone. So, I stand by my statements.

There is an 11th century Indian text that identifies Shri Simha has part of a school which de-emphasized the need for creation stage. So we have independent confirmation that Dzogchen, or what became Dzogchen, definitely existed in 8th centuruy India.

The empowerments referred to here are Dzogchen empowerments, not the empowerments of the eight lower yanas, however, the empowerments from mahāyoga or anuyoga can stand in for the elaborate empowerment, but not the unelaborate empowerment. 

Dzogchen is a complete systems that unifies all the teachings of the nine yānas into one yāna, so nothing is excluded. People have gained the wrong impression because of an over-emphasis on an apophatic approach. And because, frankly, there are many people selling Dzogchen teachings who do not have the qualifications to give these empowerments, which means they are not qualified to give Dzogchen teachings.

Sems sde does not have a complete path since it is devoid of the teachings of the secret and unsurpassed secret cycle of man ngag sde.That means that sems sde only has an intellectual presentation of the basis. One cannot confirm vidyā in direct perception on the basis of sems sde instruction, one can only confirm the reality of the mind. 

However, for someone who has received these instructions, the whole of Dzogchen can even be discerned in mahāyoga tantras such as the Guhyagarbha, Hevajra, and so on, but not without them.

When one understands Dzogchen as the basis, then these qualms vanish. Some people need a gradual introduction; others do not. But the measure of the practitioner, whether they use a gradual approach or a nongradual approach, is how often they are distracted from their primordial state a.k.a the basis or not, and thus, how much they are dominated by mind and its attendant karma and afflictions or not.

The first evidence we have of Gesar at all is in a text called Lang Poti Seru (roughly 1450), which sites Gesar in the late 10th to early 12th century as a local chieftain in the Ling region of Eastern Tibet. 

The modern day tradition of Gesar as a dharmapāla begins with an 18th century terton, Lha Rig Chen po's Gesar, the King of Vajra Life.  

MIpham's terma of Gesar, which is based on the above, has Gesar as guru, yidam, and dharmapāla, as does Khenpo Jikphun's Gesar cycle. I don't know about Namkhai Drime's Gesar cycle. Mipham's cycle is very rich with many texts for divination, Sang, Lungta, etc. 

Gesar is very important, for example, the Horse Race ballad conceals a presentation of the Dzogchen path, based on the commentary of Mipham.

Personally, I am quite comfortable with the ambiguity of Gesar. People do not hesitate to propitiate Achi, they also should not hesitate to propitiate Gesar. It can bring nothing but benefit.

It doesn't really have to. There is no absolute. If there were an absolute, it would have to be an absolute of being or nonbeing. Negating the absolute is not a commentary on whether the "absolute" is being or nonbeing. Neither predicate applies. So there is no absolute. Since the relative truth cannot be established, the ultimate truth cannot be established. In the end, there is nothing left to say. Hence Vimalakirti's answer.

The actual teaching from the Sound Tantra states that at the end of this great eon, all sentient beings in this billion world system will attain buddhahood through Dzogchen teachings.

One answer is that not all sentient beings manifest and that there are an infinite number who are latent. The other more obvious answer, but not addressed by Longchenpa, is that there are infinite numbers of world systems, with infinite numbers of beings, and that those have no obstacle to being reborn in the billion world system that form after the next period of twenty void eons between great eons.

You will notice here too an absence of mention of meat. Rather, the text focuses on qualities of food. Meat can be sattvic. It just depends on how it is prepared. Finally, most people cannot live on sattvic foods alone, but need some rajasic foods for various reasons. 

Finally, my point is that Tibetan texts on yoga do not recommend that one avoid meat, on the contrary, they recommend that one eats some meat in order to build one's strength and immunity, given how harsh the Tibetan climate is. 

Everything is relative, including diet. It is very stupid to base one's diet on religious idealism. You have no idea how many patients I have seen who have ruined their health following unhealthy vegetarian and vegan food regimens.

Ojas is actually not found in food, per se. It is the final product if you will, of the seven-fold process of metabolism described in Ayurveda/TM: nutriment (rasa)--&gt;blood--&gt;flesh--&gt;fat--&gt;bone--&gt;marrow--&gt;seminal precursor. The last tissue, seminal precursor is then divided: the pure part becomes ojas, is concentrated mainly in the heart region, but is evenly spread through the body; the impure part is discarded as reproductive tissue in both men and women (until menopause). 

The more nutritionally dense one's food is, the more ojas is available, provided these metabolic pathways are functioning properly. Vegetarians can have an ojas enhancing diet, provided they eat enough foods that are "sweet" in taste and oily in quality. Bitter and astringent foods tend to be poor supporters of an ojas-enhancing diets. Ojas-enhancing diets tend to be anabolic. There are certain instances where one will want to engage in a cleanse, which is basically a kind of catabolic diet, as a preliminary to engaging in rasāyāna, which is the consumption of herbs and foods that anabolic in nature, but which do not have high levels of ama, undigested or improperly digested foods (think arterial plaque). The downside of meat, of course, is that it can result in a lot of ama. This is why, when eating meat, it is better to eat it stewed, rather than frilled or fried.

For vegetarians, a kind of date and milk drink is very good for building ojas in depleted people. This is an excellent recipe: https://kripalu.org/resources/kripalu-r ... -ojas-milk

In general, the empowerment in order to practice the outer and inner guru sadhanas of the Longchen Nyinthig is the called the Coronation of the Victor Empowerment. It is the empowerment for both the outer and inner guru sadhanas of LN. The secret and most secret guru sadhanas have their own empowerments. 

Most people do not realize that the preliminary practices of the LN do not actually include the outer guru sadhana. The outer guru sadhana is combined with the ngondro text to make up what people now refer to as the LN Preliminaries.

So, there is in fact an empowerment for this outer guru sadhana, but it is not always given beforehand.

According to Abdhidharmakoṣabhaśya, a bardo being with excess desire whose fetus becomes a male fetus during the third week of gestation will likely end up becoming pandaka; one can infer that a bardo being with excess anger whose fetus remains female will become a female pandaka. 

According to Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine, gender preference is largely a biological outcome resulting from a uniform quantity of male and female reproductive tissues at the moment of conception.  

The question of pandakas is really only an issue for monastic ordination. It is not a moral issue, though, naturally, there are non-gender specific issues with oral sex and anal sex described in the teachings on sexual misconduct.

Try telling that to the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrantikas. All these definitions are not predicated upon native definitions of the term "dharma," and none of the authorities cited for their translation equivalents using native definitions in formulating their equivalents. 

The word "dharma" derives from "dhṛ," "to hold, to bear," and generally, among ten definitions of "dharma," the one relevant here is "bearer of characteristics." 

So, in fact, when it comes to things like the constituents of the material aggregate, indeed, the five material objects of the five material senses are indeed held to be external or "mind-independent" objects. And, beyond the four elements, there is a further derivation of the elements into secondary or derived matter. This is all explained in the Dhātu chapter of the Kośabhaṣya.

First of all, it was only the Southern Democrats that led the secession. Among Northern Democrats there were two factions: War Democrats who supported Lincoln's military policies, and Copperheads, who opposed them. Already, during the formation of the Republican party in the 1850's, many Northern Democrats joined it. Not only this, but in 1864, the Republican Party and the War Democrats formed a Unionist Party, called the National Union Party, to re-elect Lincoln. It fell apart right after the Civil War when most Republicans abandoned it. 

So, are we living in the era pre-1965 or post 1965? The reason I ask is that as far as I know, there was a realignment in the late 60's, causing racist Southern Democrats to switch their allegiance to the GOP, which in turn allowed Nixon to succeed in his election bid by using the so-called Southern Strategy. This of course means that now the GOP is the party with the most KKK in its DNA. 

That being said, since the 1930's, Northern Democrats were the union party, liberal, and devoted to FDR's New Deal. Republicans on the other hand were the business party, and largely in opposition to the New Deal, and later, the Great Society. 

The KKK was generally opposed to unions, especially integrated unions, and generally opposed the New Deal. Under FDR, the Democratic Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. We can understand that Southern Democrats were generally opposed to the New Deal. 

Prior to Reagan, there were conservatives in both parties, who formed what was known as the Conservative Coalition, which dominated Congress until the 1970's, and who opposed and undermined the New Deal as much as they were able. 

Since Reagan, conservatives have largely moved into the GOP silo, while liberals have moved into the Democratic silo. 

So, characterizing the modern Democratic and Republican Parties in terms of their pre-1965 and 1980 history is excessively misleading, since it is complicated, and cannot be simply quantified into two sections: Democrats = KKK; Republicans = 13th Amendment.

Pp. 223-224 summarize his whole argument very neatly. 

The basic argument he makes is that while Indians relied upon both direct perception (which he calls empiricism, though he mistakenly claims that Indians reject direct perception with respect to perceiving emptiness, etc.) and inferential reasoning (which he simply calls "reasoning"), the Chinese, according to him, generally rejected inferential reasoning with respect to understanding ultimate truth. 

He basically claims that differences in understanding in Indian Buddhism and Sino-Japanese Buddhism boil down to acceptance or rejection of ontological reductionism, with the Indians employing ontological reductionism as their principal approach, and Chinese Buddhists largely rejecting the ontological reductionism of the Indian Buddhist tradition in toto. 

He also states in the book that Chinese Buddhists unwittingly imported an atman back in Buddhism because of the Daoist underpinnings of Chinese civilization, pinning a complex of arguments on this notion, which he defends through an interesting walk through translation theory, comparative analysis and review of Indian Buddhism with Buddhism as it was translated into Chinese and so on. It is a very interesting book. 

Similar issues arise in Tibetan Buddhism too, where Tibetan scholars articulate arguments that would be outright rejected by their Indian forbears, based on how words translated into Tibetan are read by Tibetans, and their consequent assumptions.

Title: Re: Plants Acquiring Sentience

Consciousness distinguishes us from plants, rocks, and so on. Sentient beings have volition, thus, they possess karma. Plants have no consciousness, thus they do not possess karma.

The Buddha himself drew a clear distinction between sentience and non-sentience.  For example, in the Ratnakaraṇḍa Sūtra, the Buddha says:

With respect that, while the cessation of ignorance may not occur in the past, future, or in the present, nevertheless, any improper thinking produces ignorance. On the other hand, if there is discerning thinking because of proper thinking, [ignorance] will not be produced. That absence of production is a total cessation, therefore, it is called "cessation of ignorance." In that case, proper thinking with respect to this body, which is produced from the four great elements, is as follows: This body is inert, discerned to appear like grass, trees, walls, and stones. Whatever is called mind, intellect, or consciousness is immaterial, cannot be shown, is unimpeded, cannot be cognized, and is like an illusion or a dream. [The mind, etc.,] cannot be perceived inside [the body], outside [it], or both.

Thus, drawing a conclusion that because plants exhibit the same kind of autonomic functions as an animal's body, and therefore plants must have consciousness too, is not a good argument to make for the sentience of plants. The Buddha treated the body itself as inert, insentient, and so on. This point is really brought home when you look at the Tibetan term for body, "lus," which means "leftover," in this case, the body (rūpa skandha) is left over when the five aggregates disintegrate at the moment of death.

The point is not that there is a huge difference in the translations, the point is the assumption Wallace draws from the text. The assumption he draws is this: it is absolutely necessary for beginners to take the impure mind as the path. But that is not what Dudjom Lingpa is saying at all. He is, characteristically, describing what certain people, people of inferior capacity (dbang po dman) must do, before they can enter the actual path of Dzogchen, which is taking pristine consciousness (ye shes) as the path. 

Wallace's interest in śamatha predates his forays into Dzogchen by many years, which one can observe in his 1992 translation, Calming the Mind: Tibetan Buddhist Teachings on the Cultivation of Meditative Quiescence.

Different basis, different path, different result. That's all there is to it. You are clearly coming from a perennialist perspective, to which you are entitled, but the idea that all religions lead to the same goal is just silly.

Market regulation merely enforces what kinds of transactions are allowable, and what kind are not, without deciding who gets what, how, and when. In a crisis, Market regulation allows for limited central planning in times of severe economic crisis, but that's about it. 

Anyway, you clearly believe in market economies and states since you explain that a) in a mutual aid economy currency will be developed, and b)  you admit that states are necessary in order to scale up the benefits of mutual aid, via what you term "federalism," which is just another term for a "state."  

Accept the pervasion.

Myths are totally beyond any ability to verify, often involving figures whose existence can never be verified empirically; whereas legends are about historical people, but can't really be backed up by any source.

I make a distinction between myth, legend, and history. 

A historical character like Padmasambhava is interesting because of the way myth, legend, and history intersect in the traditions around him. He most certainly was a real person who visited Tibet for a period of time in the 8th century, during the decade between 770-780. His departure to Camara was also mentioned by Vajrāsana (c. mid-eleventh century) in the Supplication to the 84 Mahāsiddhas (grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi'i gsol 'debs (D 3758))

།དགེ་སློང་ལུས་ཀྱིས་ཕྱག་རྒྱ་བསྟེན། །ལྷོ་ནུབ་སྲིན་པོའི་ཁ་གནོན་མཛད། །
པདྨ་ཀཱ་ར་ཞེས་བྱ་བའི། །བླ་མ་དེ་ལ་ཕྱག་འཚལ་ལོ།

With the form of a bhikṣu, reliant on a consort 
[the one who] suppressed the rakṣasas in the southwest 
I prostrate to that guru
called Padmakāra.

Now, it is very possible that Vajrāsana heard about the legend of Padmasambhava from Tibetans, and penned this verse influenced by that. But if this is actually an Indian tradition, this confirms three facts about Guru RInpoche: one, he was a bhiḳsu; two, he made of use of consorts, even though maintaining the garb of an ordained person; three, he is reputed to have gone to the southwest to tame rakṣasas (indigenous people dwelling where?). It is also interesting to note that "rakṣasa" is also a poetic name for the southwest.  

I have not seen any mention of the Supplication to the 84 Mahāsiddhas in the academic literature on the subject of Padmasambhava, so this source seems to have been overlooked by scholars researching the topic. So it is an interesting question, likely unanswerable, as to whether this brief verse impacted the Tibetan concepts of Guru Rinpoche or not. 

However in my personal practice, I allow the mythic dimension of Guru RInpoche to take precedence, since for me, that is where the juice is found.

Which is why authoritarian governments generally take a poor view of NGOs. They challenge the authority of ineffective states. They also can inhibit the development of social apparatus. We see this in Haiti, where the Haitian government has basically ceded many of its responsibilities to various NGOs.  

Your idea, like all stateless utopianism, sounds wonderful on paper, in practice, it cannot succeed beyond a local and limited scale. 

As I pointed out, I live in New England, which is a strong history and cultural ethos of mutual aid, from barn-raising to you name it. But mutual aid is not going to put food on the table of everyone, guarantee their healthcare, educate their kids, train professionals, etc. 

I'll stick to my original conclusion. There is no alternative to the present dominant, global economic system. I do not say this out of some allegiance to capitalism as an economic system, far from it, I just don't see any alternatives that can function alongside capitalism. The Marxist-Leninists tried this in the USSR and China, and their attempt failed utterly. Centrally-planned economies simply do not supply demand as well as regulated market economies.

There are two versions of the 84 Mahāsiddhas. The earlier one is a text written by Vajrasāna in the 11th century, which mentions Padmasambhava, specifically as someone who appears as a bhikṣu with a consort. The lists only partially match between the two versions.

The commentary goes on to say that this is all for just making the process of giving introduction to inferior students a little easier by calming their conceptuality.

So there is  a causal link to praying to god and then getting direct introduction? How does that work? Basically Pero, if you go to receive Dzogchen teachings, you are an Ex-whatever. Oh, sure, you can maintain outward form of a Christian, etc., but if your view does not change, you will not realize the meaning.

Sure he is. He is saying, for example, that the Jesus prayer can be a preliminary practice for Dzogchen. 

Also, if he actually said this, "such than someone from any background could in theory take the mind as the path, attain shamatha, and realize the nature of consciousness and the truth of reincarnation. And so on for the rest of the path," this just does not work in Dzogchen teachings.

It is a complete abortion of an idea.

Confucius was not a Dzogchen master and did not transmit Dzogchen teachings. Shankaracarya, etc. were not Dzogchen masters and did not transmit Dzogchen teachings. 

At base, if you want to practice Dzogchen, you need to rely on Dzogchen lineage masters.

It is possible some kind of libertarian municipalism can insulate some communities for a time against the economic shock of decline, but what you are fundamentally arguing for, and not without reason, are small communities that band together with common interest in order to stave off the chaos that such collapse entails. 

We already see fascist militias banding together in the US and openly flying Confederate flags and swastikas in our State Capitals:





In absence of a strong federal government, these people will ride-rough shod over anyone who stands in their way, and will kill anyone who does not go along with their Guns and Jesus insanity.

No, Greg, but it isn't a plan, either. I live in rural community, where there is a lot of mutual aid, so to speak. It is necessary, but it won't prevent a collapse of civilization and the inevitable wars and nuclear conflicts, epidemics, and so on which are the consequence of that. 

Mutual aid generally results in the creation of protective associations, which are the precursors to states. This is all laid out in the sutras. We are fully in the age of strife at present, and it only gets worse from here. But we try to apply palliatives as much as possible in hopes that it will stem some of the acute misery all humans will face as a result of continued, world-wide capitalist hegemony and the class-based society necessary to the functioning of capitalism. Capitalism will do just fine during the collapse, until it doesn't.

Gold reserves do not back cash and they shouldn't. A brief study of history of money will demonstrate that tying the value of currency to a solid asset is perilous at best, for example, the collapse of silver prices in 1640 which led to a fractious period in European history and toppled several gvts.
