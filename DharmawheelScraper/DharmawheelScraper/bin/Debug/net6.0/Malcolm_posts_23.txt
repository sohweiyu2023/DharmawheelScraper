Yes. You need to read Peter Alan Roberts book on Rechungpa where he discusses at length the process by which Milarepa's biography is slowly altered over time, culminating in Tsang Nyon Heruka's fantasy novel. This, btw, does not mean that TNH's book is without literary merit -- quite the contrary. But we cannot rely on it for accurate information about Milarepa (or Marpa, etc.)

The Buddha was pretty clear what Dharma and Discipline would contain awakened people, a Dharma and Discipline that contained the eightfold path. That path starts from right view. 

Now, it is possible that someone, in isolation, based on having meditated Buddhist instructions in a past life, may in this life, for example, recall those and based on this attain awakening, a so-called pratyekabuddha. But they do not teach. 

Now, as far as I am concerned, if one's practice of the path is not grounded on the view of dependent origination, one will not be able to understand reality properly, and one will not be able to wake up. Dependent origination is the "original nature" of everything and there is no "original nature" apart from dependent origination.

As pointed out in another thread; the tathāgatagarbha theory is largely enumerated in the Nirvana Sūtra, the same sūtra that proposes a class of beings called icchantikas. Even Candrakīrti, while rejecting this theory in the face of it, admits there are some beings who are so evil, with so much bad karma, they will never attain liberation.

The Nirvana Sūtra also is the only Buddhist sūtra which advances something like a Buddhist concept of a just war.

This is not at all the case. This is like claiming there is zero proof the Rig Veda survived intact as a oral text in more or less its present form for the past 3500 years. 

The methods used by Buddhist monks during the time of the Buddha to memorize and then transmit what he said were very precise and specific, and frankly, their memories were trained to an amazingly high degree. There is too much agreement between what we have in the Agamas and the Pali Canon to imagine that the Buddha's words were not faithfully preserved. This does not mean there was no variation, or that no distortions crept in. But this particular assertion of the Buddha is so wide spread in so many different sūtras and suttas, that it cannot be ignored in the facile manner you have attempted to do so here. 

No one who seriously studies these things refuses to acknowledge that the Agamas and the Pali Canon are a good record of what the Buddha taught his students in person.

This didactic story does not contradict what the Buddha has clearly stated in many sutras:  to whit, outside of his Dharma and Discipline there are no realized person, no stream entrants, once-returners, never-returners, nor arhats. This means there are no realized people at all outside of Buddhadharma. As much as we may be fond of and recognize the value of some nonbuddhist masters, the height of their wisdom and words do not even reach the bottom slopes of the Buddha's incomparable wisdom.

As you know, the Guhygarbha's statment, "Incorrect realization, partial realization, and not realizing perfectly," refers respectively to nonbuddhists, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and those who practice the common Mahāyāna. 

However, in the Indian treatises, "ekayāna" means different things. For example, in the Lankāvatāra, ekayāna does not include all the other vehicles. "The One Vehicle" refers to Mahāyāna only because it has not been obtained in the past by others. It is stated that it is because of the karmic traces and knowledge obscuration śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have that the Buddha teaches three vehicles, and that the teaching of one vehicle is actually only for Mahāyānis. Given that the Lanka was set down quite some time later than the Saddharmapundarika, we can understand this as a response to it. Likewise, the Nirvana responds to the prediction of all sentient beings as capable of attaining Buddhahood in Saddharmapundarika with the notion of the icchantika, while at the same time promoting tathāgatagarbha, as contradictory as that may seem.

Well, you cannot have it both ways. Either there is one vehicle, in which case the emptiness realized by śrāvaka arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas is the same (Candrakīriti's point of view) or three, in which case the emptiness realized by śrāvaka arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas is not the same. 

Which one is it?

You keep asserting there is some identity between some distant being in the past and a buddha in the present. There is a continuum from sentient being hood to buddhahood (the relative, clear aspect of the mind), but there is no identity there, no being at point a who becomes a buddha at point z. 

There is a discontinuity in so far as what was once afflicted is no longer afflicted. But this does not mean that all or even any actions undertaken while in a state of affliction have any bearing at all in becoming free from affliction.  

But your point seems to be that whatever one does while a sentient being inevitably leads to buddhahood. That, in my opinion, would be a very strange view.

That does not follow in the least, which is why Greg pointed out that the three poisons which lead to negative karma cannot be construed as paths to Buddhahood.

There really aren't many details. So speculating about the Bodhisattvas moment of pity in hell is just speculation. He had a moment of pity, and it set him on the bodhisattva path, according to some traditional Mahāyāna accounts. The other detail about this is that at that time, the Buddha of that epoch was a buddha from the same clan, the Śākya. You have to love the absolute disregard Indians had for time. This even happened many mahākalpas ago, but still the Indias thought there was a Śākya clan millions upon millions of eons ago.

You are not old, and I don't give people passes for using racist terms.

The point about upāya is that it is a method or a means. It is skillful when it correct applied to a given situation, and unskillful when it is not. 

But just saying "everything is a method" is somewhat lame. Why? Because there is also wisdom, prajñā. A method without wisdom cannot be skillful in anyway. Wisdom without method is ineffective at doing anything. So you need both. When you have both method and wisdom, your methods will be skillful, adroit, and appropriate.

One of the unfortunate things about hell is that no one can see anyone else, all one can hear is their screams. There really is no way to set an example for anyone. 

The Bodhisattva earned merit through his act, and set himself on the long road to buddhahood. He neither set an example for anyone while in hell, nor did he have an example, beyond his own moment of pity for others based on his own suffering.

Anyway, you don't really take Dharma that seriously because you are just into promulgating your own version of Buddhism, and you try to twist everything into the Buddhist narrative you have signed up for.

What is the difference? Just as a shepherd does not rest until all their flock is penned at night, a shepherd bodhisattva puts off their own buddhahood until all sentient beings are liberated. On the other hand, just as king looks after his own benefit first, and then takes care of the kingdom, a king bodhisattva first attains buddhahood and then helps sentient beings. The first is superior to the second, but the second is more practical for sentient beings.

From a Buddhist point of view, one cannot change one's gender.

One is born either male, female, or nonbinary (with it's five subcategories). The impulse to alter one's apparent gender is itself a sign that one has been born with a nonbinary gender indriya.

Actually, there is quite a bit of discussion of gender in the Kośabhaṣyaṃ since it bears on gender, and gender is a concern in ordination. There are several gender orientations that were barred from ordination. Also blond people were barred from ordination as well, since in India people with blond hair were considered demonic.

Their realization differed because their view differed. From the perspective of Candrakīrti, for example, Yogacāra practice does not lead to the path of seeing. This was contested by Yogacārins, naturally. 

If we examine the texts of the respective systems, we can see that the standard division of Madhyamaka and Yogacāra as deep and vast is grounded in reality. 

Madhyamaka focuses on the profound view, whereas, Yogacāra focuses on a detailed explanation of the bodhisattva path. There is no difference in practice, but there is a difference in view. The de facto Indian position (while not entirely uncontested) is that Madhyamaka and the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras are the summum bonum of Mahāyāna teachings.

The baseline standard for what is "true," from a Madhyamaka perspective, is that which can be conventionally known by ordinary people. Phenomena beyond such conventional knowledge can be accepted based on testimony, but it is a very thin authority.

There is no contradiction. The Dharma of past Buddhas no longer exists, as least not in any complete form. What we know of the Dharma of past Buddhas comes from this Buddha.

The problem, however, people have very divergent opinions about what this passage means. Perhaps that in itself is the counterfeit Dharma, the fact that we cannot agree even on the most basic principles of what constitutes the Dharma.

Eternal things do not disappear, but conditioned things with parts, for example, the Dharma, do:

"That's the way it is, Kassapa. When beings are degenerating and the true Dhamma is disappearing, there are more training rules and yet fewer monks established in final gnosis. There is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world, but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has arisen in the world. Just as there is no disappearance of gold as long as a counterfeit of gold has not arisen in the world, but there is the disappearance of gold when a counterfeit of gold has arisen in the world, in the same way there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world, but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has arisen in the world

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... .than.html

There are many things which lead to the perishing of the Dharma, Christopher Titmus lists a number of sources concerning this here:

https://www.christophertitmussblog.org/ ... the-buddha

Dependent origination is simply, Where is arose, that arose; with the arising of that, this arises."  If you assert the Dharma is dependent origination, then you will are asserting a impermanent, conditioned thing as the Dharma in contradiction to your claim. I am happy to accept that teachings on dependent origination are the Dharma, since the Buddha said, "Whoever sees dependent origination sees the Dharma, whoever sees the Dharma sees dependent origination." [M.I.190] But if you claim the Dharma is eternal, you will claim that dependent origination is eternal. 

Likewise, at S.III.120, the Buddha says, "Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Buddha, whoever sees the Buddha sees the Dharma." Clearly, the Buddha is not eternal according to these sources, so claiming based on Pali sources that the Dharma or the Buddha is eternal is not going to fly.

Beyond that, only two kinds of Dharma are defined the texts we have-- scripture and realization. Since texts and oral traditions vanish, and realized people die; both are impermanent. Thus, defining a third Dharma which is permanent or eternal is novel and without textual basis.

Hinayāna scriptures do not talk about the four "seals" at all. They do have a regular list of three itemse which excludes nirvana:

All formations ('du byed, samskara) are impermanent.
All formations are suffering.
All phenomena lack a self.

In its earliest usage in Mahāyāna Sūtras, the so called "four seals" were termed the four summaries of the Dharma (chos kyi mdo bzhi), and took the following form:

All formations are impermanent.
All formations are suffering.
All phenomena lack a self.
Nirvana is peaceful.

The term the "four seals" comes from the Korean Master Won Chuk's commentary on the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra. He identifies several sources for them, but specifically, the Mahāyānasutrālaṃkāra is the source for the term phyag rgya. However the term "seal" is not a direct translation, and in my opinion has lead to some confusion.

The term dharmoddānacatuṣṭayaṃ was translated into Chinese, from there into Tibetan as chos kyi phyag rgya bzhi in Wong Chuk's treatise. When translated directly from Sanskrit to Tibetan, it is chos kyi sdom ni rnam pa bzhi, i.e. the four constraints of the Dharma. 

In reality, we have two terms used in Mahāyāna texts: 1) the four summaries of the Dharma and the four constraints of the Dharma, that latter coming from Mahāyānasutrālaṃkāra.

In my opinion, the term "four constraints" is more useful than "four seals," 1) because it shows us not how this or that teaching should be authenticated as a Dharma teachings with some seal of imprimatur, but rather, within what constraints a Dharma teaching should fall. 2) "Constraint" more accurately reflects the underlying original meaning of the term uddāna because it is derived from Sanskrit--&gt;English, rather than the Sanskrit--&gt;Chinese--&gt;Tibetan--&gt;English. Also, constraint/restraint is a widely accepted usage for translating the term sdom pa in this context. 

Going forward, I suggest that we drop the usage "four seals of the Dharma" since it is misleading and not accurate.

Finally, in some presentations the second constraint is listed as "All that is contaminated is suffering," but surprisingly, it is very uncommon in this list which is mentioned through out Mahāyāna sūtras in many places. The reading above is the most common in the Sūtras. In one or two places you see "empty" attached to the third constraint, as in "All phenomena are empty and without a self."

Yeah, so this really proves that people just believe whatever they want, without reference to any authority at all. For example, Greg, who believes the Dharma is some timeless principle, like Plato's forms. This really is my whole point and the reason it is so fruitless to get all up in arms about people like Chogyam, and so on unless it can be proven beyond doubt they are harming sentient beings with anything more than the proliferation of delusion, which we do all the time here too. Then we have teachers who teach a Dharma everyone approves of, guys like Sogyal, who seem unstoppable in their ability to actually harm others with impunity. 

Just for reference, the Tathāgata's Inconcievable Secret Sūtra (ārya-tathāgata-acintya-guhya-nirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra) states the purpose of four is as follows:

Guhyapati, the Tathagāta has summarized all Dharmas, presenting the summary of Dharmas as four-fold. What are the four? In order to destroy the idea of permanence in bhikṣus and brahmins who advocate eternalism, and the long-lived devas, it is said, "All formations are impermanent." In order destroy the idea of happiness in devas and humans, it is said, "All formations are suffering." In order to destroy the non-Buddhist assertion of self, it is said, "All phenomena lack self." In order to destroy the strong pride of those engaged in conceptuality, it is said, "Nirvana is peace." 


There are many places in sūtras and tantras where these four are discussed. But I think this is one of the best presentations because it shows the four summaries very clearly.

It never states in any sūtra or tantra for that matter, that the Dharma, the teaching of the Buddha, is permanent. Maitreyanatha in fact states just the opposite of your opinion. 

Confusing dharmatā, etc., with the Dharma is confusing something unconditioned with something conditioned. But since one cannot establish the unconditioned since it never existed, it also makes no sense to claim that unconditioned dharmatā is some sort of stable refuge. Unconditioned dharmatā is just a name for the emptiness of conditioned, impermanent phenomena, and without that latter, there is no dharmatā at all, even conventionally. 

Finally, if the Dharma were something permanent, the Buddha would not have spoken of its decline and disappearance, and neither would have Nāgārjuna, Maitreyanatha, and so on in very clear terms. All compounded phenomena are impermanent. The Dharma is compounded. If you imagine the Dharma is permanent you have contravened your own four seals, beginning with the first, "all compounded phenomena are suffering." 

The rest as we know as the regularly stated in the sūtras "All compounded phenomena are suffering. All compounded phenomena are empty and lack self. Nirvana is peace."

If you claim the Dharma is permanent and ultimate, this is tantamount to declaring it is not empty and self.

If one cannot figure out if teachers are bonafide, how can one figure out if the teaching is bonafide? You have neatly demonstrated how impossible it is to establish anything with appeals to authority since you have basically affirmed no one can decide what is bonafide and what is not.

That is quite a pickle you have gotten yourself into there, Harold.

In answer to question one, Rig pa is the means by which ye shes "manifests", though in Dzogchen it is a little strange to parse it that way.

Basically, the basis is considered to be ye shes, that is, the luminous, empty pure nature of the mind, which is not known to us at present. 

Recognizing this is rigpa. 

There are other ways the term is used which suggest that rig pa itself also also the nature of the mind which is being recognized. Thus, we need to pay attention to the context in which the term is being used in any given text.

Title: Re: The Aro Authenticity Debate.

It is pretty simple -- there isn't the slightest bit of empirical evidence that from Mahāyāna onward any of these texts, sūtra and tantras, long oral lineage or short treasure lineage, were indeed spoken by the Buddha and so on. 

Based upon this, I really think the standard of accepting and rejecting Buddhist teachings ought to be based not upon their putative origin, but rather, whether or not they are well-spoken. 

If someone chooses to believe all the treasures we have received to date, for example, are the words of Padmasambhava, this is just fine. But it is a conscious choice for a Westerner not raised in Tibet in the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions to believe this. 

This also presents problems. Many tantras are not "well spoken" if taken literally.  But tantras that might be considered mere manuals of sorcery and necromancy are rendered "well-spoken" through a process interpretive extraction of meaning.  

Many treasures are very beautifully composed, and correspond well with the meaning of sūtra and tantra as we have them. Many sadhanas we have, in all schools are well-spoken, beautiful compositions, that correspond well to the interpretative pyrotechnics used to extract the meaningful essence from the raw ore of the tantras. 

My personal opinion is that Dzogchen tantras are among the most well-spoken of Buddhist texts, which is one of my main reasons for being enthusiastic about them, and which require almost no need for hermeneutic strategies like the six limits and so on commonly employed to extract meaning from tantras generally understood by western scholars to be composed in India. 

When confronted with the things that people like Kim Katami say, or Majorie Quinn, and frankly, many other people advertising themselves as teachers these days, their statements and theories appear to me to very crude and not well stated, not in accord with what I personally understand to be well-spoken. 

When confronted with novelties like Kalima as a yidam, it is very hard, as far as I am concerned, to justify her inclusion as yidam deity, as the basis of an authentic Buddhist path. So when Christy McNally is bestowing Kāli empowerments, and Michael Roach is writing Jesus Sadhanas, I personally think it is mistaken. But, obviously no one is listening to me. In the end it is left to each of us to be responsible for own path and practice. 

Thus, the concern for proving the provenance of a lineage seems to be like chasing a willow wisp, it is something always just out of grasp, and the force we use to try and catch it, just pushes it slightly more beyond our reach. 

In conclusion: the only proof anyone is able to offer for the validity of their own lineage is their own faith in it; and the only proof of the invalidity of some other lineage is their lack of faith in it. 

This leads us, sadly, right back to the confusion of the Kalamas and the Buddha's reply:


It is proper for you, Kalamas, to doubt, to be uncertain; uncertainty has arisen in you about what is doubtful. Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas, when you yourselves know: 'These things are bad; these things are blamable; these things are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill,' abandon them.

Greg, the Treasure tradition is more than a thousand years old. So, I think you must have made a hasty mistake. The earliest Buddhist terton in the Padmasambhava sense of the term was Sangye Lama, who lived in the early 11th century. Bonpo termas also date to this period, with Shenchen Luga's revelations. 

In all of that time, there really is no method for proving a treasure is valid or invalid, apart from some respected person expressing their approval of the treasure itself. Though, there have been people trying to act as tertons, who, much to their surprise, revealed boxes of turds because someone caught them out in their act and substituted their treasure for shit. 

And even today, in Tibet, there are successful tertons who are accused of being frauds by some, and heralded as buddhas by others. It just isn't a certain enterprise with exacting standards. Even more problematical are pure visions -- for example, Shugden texts and so on are claimed to be a pure vision teaching. 

As to your final point, apparently many rational people do conclude the Aro crew are authentic enough, and the proof of this is that they have many followers. Books by Aro people like Dangerous Friend remain popular and in print at Shambhala Pubs, and so on. 

All of this attachment to credentials and validation is a māra of gigantic proportions. 

I personally could care less if Aro teachings are authentic or not. I don't see you hassling Ivo, or the Flaming Jewel people, or Pema Khandro, and so on, thus your motives in demanding Aro people to prove their authenticity are rather...misguided in my opinion. 

When you examine the history of such polemics, their targets tend to ignore the fuss and just continue to do what they do, heedless of their critics. I suspect the Aro folk will do just that. At this point, you are banging your head against a wall of indifference to you or anyone else's opinion about them.

Sorry to break it to you, but notions like "truth" and "authority" are merely conventions, and flimsy ones at that when it comes to the domain of religion. When you follow a religion, all you have is your own opinion that "this is true and this is false" since the most basic metaphysical principles in a religion can neither be proven nor disproven by conventional means at all— not god, not karma, not rebirth, not even awakening. The arrogant supposition that these things can be proven is one of the chief reasons people turn into fundamentalist ninnies who madly wave sutras at each other in Buddhism, and other scriptures in other religions.  

And when it comes to empirical validation, then, it is pretty stupid to say gravity does not function near an entity that has sufficient mass to attract objects to it, since these things can be easily verified by anyone with a bit of math and observation. Now, remind me, just what was the math that irrefutably demonstrates karma and rebirth? 

Now, we can certainly agree, for example, that Maitreyanatha expressed a position, an opinion, that the only true refuge was the Buddha since he possesses the dharmakāya. But no one at all, not even Maitreyanatha, can prove the Buddha indeed had such a possession. it is just dogma. Dogma is fun, but it never liberated anyone from afflictions.

People who believe "truth" and "authority" as ultimate principles just plant the seeds for fundamentalism in their own minds. Ultimately, there is no truth and no authority, and in terms of conventional truths and authorities, we pick the ones we like, and we reject the ones we don't like. Hopefully the conventions and truths we pick are not harmful to ourselves or others. 

And having said that, I still cannot see for the life of me why the existence of Aroter is such an existential threat to some Buddhists on this board. They are not harming anyone, and as far as I know, they all accept rebirth, dependent origination, karma, Padmsambhava, Samantabhadra, Buddha and so on as meaningful. Who cares if some of their deities look like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean? Most Buddhists in the world, who have an opinion about it, think that Vajrayāna just a bunch of made-up corrupt, crypto-Hindu bullshit anyway, further corrupted by Tibetan shamanism.  And some on this board really are throwing stones while inhabiting glass houses.

If we both accept a text as an authority, then appeals to authority work quite well, as long as we both agree they are authoritative. But if we don't agree a text is an authority, there is no point in citing a text because there is no basis for agreement, for example, citing Buddhist texts at Christians, or Nichiren Buddhits citing Nichiren at Tibetan Buddhists, or even Nyingmapas citing terma texts at Gelugpas.

And as Maitreyanatha explains in the Uttaratantra, the Dharma, and the Sangha are all impermanent, and therefore, they are not ultimate refuges. Only the Buddha is an ultimate refuge:

Because of abandonment, because of possessing deceptive phenomena,

the two Dharmas and the assembly of āryas
are not the supreme permanent refuge.

Seriously, if one is an ārya in the equipoise of nondual emptiness, then such things are supposedly possible.

Can you provide anything more than anecdotal evidence that any treasure is "valid?" Apart from personally engaging in their practice themselves, the only pramāṇa, authority or valid cognition, upon which one may rely upon for authenticating treasures is śabdapramāṇa, the authority that depends on the testimony of a reliable witness. But in that case, how does one establish the witness as an authority? 

In the end, śabdapramāṇa amounts to no more than this, as the great Dzogchen master and scholar, Gendun Chophel remarks:

Whatever most people like appears as the truth; whatever most mouths agree on appears as a philosophical tenet. Inside of each person is a different form of valid knowledge, with an adamantine scripture supporting it.

Madman's Middle Way, pg. 63.

And:

Inferential valid knowledge is produced from direct awareness; inference analyzes whether direct perception is true or false; because the child is serving as the father's witness, I am uncomfortable about positing conventional validity.

Madman's Middle Way, pg. 62

And finally, to demonstrate the poverty of your wish for a certain proof that anything can be proven to be true or false with respect to validating a treasure and any other teaching at all:

One may think:"We concede that our decisions are unreliable, but when we follow the decisions of the Buddha, we are infallible." Then who decided the Buddha was infallible? If you say, "The great scholars and adepts like Nāgārjuna decided that he was infallible," then who decided that Nāgārjuna was infallible? If you say, "The Foremost Lama [Tshong kha pa] decided it," then who knows that the Foremost Lama is infallible? If you say, "Our kind and peerless lama, the excellent and great so and so decided," than infallibility, which depends on your own excellent lama, is decided by your own mind. In fact, therefore, it is a tiger who vouches for a lion, it is a yak who vouches for a tiger, it is a dog who vouches for a yak, it is a mouse who vouches for a dog, it is an insect who vouches for a mouse. Thus, an insect is made the final voucher for them all. Therefore, when one analyzes in detail the final basis for any decision, apart from coming back to one's own mind, nothing else whatsoever is perceived.

Madman's Middle Way, pp. 49-50

So your demand that the Aro people prove their treasures are valid is really quite foolish, and your denunciation of their teachings is based solely on your own jaundiced eye.

What has been taught by the Tathagata as the possession of marks, that is truly a no-possession of no-marks.'

Nongrasping is more important than pure vision. How do we know this? 

One does not start a sadhana, for example, beginning with pure vision. We begin by meditating that all phenomena are empty, free from extremes. Then,  for a while we engage in conceptual proliferation that we pretend is pure. In the end, we let all that conceptual proliferation vanish back into emptiness free from extremes. This is the essence of the creation stage and the completion stage. 

The completion stage is more important because the essence of the completion stage is nongrasping.

Those people, whose own afflictions are not in check, that demand or suggest others observe pure vision are definitely hypocrites, whether they are teachers or students. 

Therefore, everyone (gurus included) should check and see whether their own afflictions are in check prior to criticizing what they imagine to be the afflicted perceptions of others. If people really did this, I bet the silence would be deafening. 

Full disclosure-- everything I say and do is merely the glow of the raging bonfire of my own afflictions, which is why you never see me recommending to anyone that they should "practice" pure vision with respect to anything or anyone as a rebuke or a remedy to some worldly controversy. I have discussed the notion of training in pure vision with respect to the creation stage, because that is the essential theory of the creation stage. 

More to the point, if one has to train in pure vision one is afflicted. If one is afflicted, one's vision is not pure. One's vision will not become pure by imagining that one is a buddha in the middle of a palace surrounded by gods, goddesses, and so on. It will not become pure by imagining one's guru is a buddha.

One's vision will only become pure when one is free from grasping. Therefore, it is much better to train in nongrasping than it is to train in pure vision.

You do understand that citing chains of authority only leads back to one's own judgment, right? In the end it is we ourselves who decide what is false and what is true. No one can do that for us, not even the Buddha. 

So, you have decided the Aro trip is fraudulent, and that is totally cool with me. 

But let me put it you this way. If some Sakyapa or Gelugpa came up to you and said that your practice was fraudulent because it had no lineage and was just a fantasy concocted by a Tibetan named Dili Terton, how would you feel? You would feel completely disrespected. Well, I am pointing out to you that there are hundreds of people who find a great deal of value in Aroter, who follow it, try to practice it, and if they were to read your denunciations of their tradition, I can imagine that they would feel completely disrespected. So you need to put yourself in their place, and see how things feel from their point of view, and frankly, stop being so unkind to them with your self-righteous denunciations. Just as you cannot prove the validity of your tradition, you also cannot prove their tradition is false. 

All we can do is live and let live and each go our separate ways, which is how Tibetans actually deal with these issues. You might try following their lead.

bkra lam me (བཀྲ་ལམ་མེ་) is an actual word. Apart from obvious phonetic mistakes like confusing bkra (brilliant) with khra (harrier), and not understanding that me reduplicates of the final consonant in lam as an intensifier, quite frankly, I have seen any number of fanciful etymologies of Tibetan words explained by Tibetans, based on similar kinds of errors,  for example the fanciful etymolgies we see for bye ma la mu tra, a.k.a Paṇḍita Vimalamitra of Vima sNying thig fame. 

These kinds of fanciful etymologies are also found in Indian Buddhist text.  All that this explanation shows is that Chogyam's Tibetan is awful. 

In reality, he is talking about ojas (mdangs) the most subtle part of food refined into a subtle fluid that maintains health, vitality, sexual potency, and ultimately, one's life force. Ojas means "brilliant."

But he is not talking about the Dharma here, he is talking about the effect of stress, sexual misconduct, etc., on one's brilliance. The principle thing that degrades ojas is sadness and stress. 

Trungpa invented a whole new vocabulary for Westerners out of Tibetan words that has little or nothing at all do with how they are actually understood in Tibetan culture. But I am sure you think he is an authentic terton. Why? 

So, you are going have to do a little better to find something Chogyam is teaching which really contradicts the Dharma. Fanciful explanations based on ignorance of Tibetan isn't sufficient, because Tibetans engaged in plenty of fanciful explanations based on ignorance of Sanskrit, as anyone knows who has taken the time to read Sakya Paṇḍita's Differentiation of the Three Vows.

A personal aside:

BTW, I was quite young in the Dharma when I met Ngagpa Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche (the recollection of whose name never fails to bring tears to my eyes), at a time when he and Chogyam did not get along anymore. But I have to admit that Ngagpa Rimpoche emphatically stated to me personally that he wanted no part in any conflict with Chogyam, despite Rinpoche's personal disappointment in many of Chogyam's decisions. In my youthful delusion that I mistook for faith, out of pride I took up a grudge that was not mine to carry. That is why I issued an apology for saying unkind things about the Aro folk, such as  "Their teachings are fake termas." 

There is no authority upon which we may rely, apart from our own judgement. But we are not omniscient, and many teachings loudly once decried as fraudulent are now praised everywhere without question. Who is to say that Aroter is not something like this? You? Me? Anyone?

Their problems are local, and a result of their own penchant for voting up guns and Jesus and voting down education, birth control, gun control, higher taxes on property and so on, they have basically screwed themselves, and things won't get better until they understand how pernicious the GOP vision for the USA actually is.

When I say I dissuade people from becoming ngakpas. I don't mean that I tell people, "don't take empowerments, don't practice the two stages, don't recite mantras," I mean that when someone comes to me and asks me how they can be "ordained" as a ngakpa (and there is actually no such thing as a ngakpa ordination) by receiving the hair empowerment, etc., I tell them it is a bad idea to receive the hair empowerment because either you cannot cut your hair at all (my tradition) or you have to constantly apologize for cutting your hair through confessions (Dudjom Tersar). 

So it is better that people, especially beginners, do not take on this commitment. If someone has done their ngondro, is stable in their practice, has experience of the two stages, and is committed to being the equivalent of a Buddhist sadhu in some respect, then that is fine and they are free to do as they wish. 

Basically, if you have to ask someone, "Should I become a ngakpa," the answer from them should always be "No." If you have to ask, you are not ready.

This is completely separate from my evaluation of the pros and cons of the Ngakpa tradition as a socio-economic phenomena in Tibetan culture.

I don't think I said that. I think what I said was the success or failure of Ngakpa tradition in the West will be largely dependent on whether there is a need for services provided by ngakpas. Right now, I am pretty sure the demand for doctors, psychologists such as yourself, and social workers will always be much higher than people who have gained expertise in making thread crosses, zors, and playing ritual instruments. Personally, I think there is a massive amount of "spiritual" materialism connected with interest in the Ngakpa tradition, but the same can be said of every tradition within Buddhism, which is a larger point. And it is also one reason why I generally discourage people from "becoming ngakpas." This has nothing to do with feeling that one's performance of Nāga pujas safeguards refugees. One does not need to be a "ngakpa" to do a Nāga puja, though it may seem more impressive when done by folks kitted out in full ngakpa gear.

Some people like to imagine that the commodification of Dharma, a.k.a Buddhism, is brand new. It isn't, it has been there right from the start. Ever since Anathapindika donated his garden to the Sangha, the professional Sangha has been involved in primitive capital accumulation, and has experienced all of the corruption and graft that entails. Evidence of this exists because there are rules governing misappropriation by monastics, which have rather sever penalties, say, as opposed to the total lack of penalty for drinking alcohol, killing animals, or harming plants. Further examples can be seen in the debate between Mahāyāna monastics and their non-Mahāyāna counterparts over the appropriateness of handling money, engaging in trade, and receiving fees for the performance of religious services and so on. 

So, when we take a look at Buddhism as a human phenomena, we see that it also carries with it all human frailties and faults. Why do you think I make a distinction between Buddhism and Buddhadharma? The Ngakpa tradition and ngakpas themselves (being human) are not exempt from human impulses, urges, and practices.

It is properly spelled ཡེ་འབྲོག་སུམ་བརྒྱ་དྲུག་ཅུ. But we see ye 'grogs and ye 'drogs as well. 

According to Desid Sangye Gyatso, the 360 Yedrog have a couple of meanings. One has to do with the 360 joints of the body explained in Kālacakra which cause unhappiness of fear and so on when under the power of affliction. 

But the meaning from "astrology" is more useful here. It has to do with connate gods and spirits (lha dang 'dre). He cites a text called Illumination (gnang gsal):

When the body and mind separate into two,
there are connate gods and demons. 
Those gods accompany the mind (sems) upward,
the spirits accompany the intellect (yid) of the deceased,
further, accompany the demon (bdud) of the deceased downward. 

He continues that this means when one has obscurations, one is accompanied by demons; when free of obscuration, one is accompanied by gods. 

Also they are considered harmful non human spirits. 

However, in terms of the rite you are translating, it is probably best to go with "360 misfortunes"

A lot of the reasons he says this or that thing are not obvious until you study more. But in Vajrayāna somehow, people think it is more virtuous to blindly follow their teachers than it is to find out why they say this thing or that thing, or investigate the reasons behind this or that statement.

How do you think monasteries support themselves? They do so based on demand for their services by the local lay populace. This is why they charge fees for this rite and that puja. The same is true of Ngakpa Dratsangs. 

When you go have your obstacle reading done yearly and find out what rites you need for the coming year, you pay the astrologer, as well as the monks you hire to recite this massive collection of sūtras, or that one; if you are doing a thangkha painting for a deceased relative based in their death reading, you pay the artist and so on. 

So yes, religious services in Tibet were tightly bound to market demand, and those practitioners regarded as more "powerful" got a lot more work, and fees for services than Joe Schmoe Ngakpa who spent his time drinking and sexually harassing the local girls. Weather controllers, invariably Ngakpas, who were unsuccessful in preventing hail, for example, were stiffly fined for their failure because their salaries were derived from taxes imposed on the local farmers who depended on their services.

Back to my point —&nbsp;there is very little market demand for such services in the West.

Right, just as ChNN did. Knowledge is not an obscuration. Lack of knowledge is. 

In fact, the Holy Writ maintains that when one is really making progress in one's practice of Dzogchen, one's body feels very light and pleasant, parasites flee the body (such as lice), one's need for food decreases, and so on. All of these signs are characteristic also of someone who has mastered sutrayāna style śamatha. Rongzom confirms this idea by his insistence that those who are gradual capacity people (all of us, I have never met a cig car ba) need to develop the first dhyāna (with it's characteristic five factors) combined with Dzogchen view, either in connection with mantra practice or just by doing regular śamatha.

For example, ChNN maintains that if we can be in "instant presence" for a very short period of time, a few seconds, our practice is continuing pretty well. I am not sure how useful being in instant presence for a few seconds is for evaluating the effectiveness of being in instant presence for pain management, though I am certain it is useful for understanding any physical sensation as phantasmagorical. On the other hand, I know very clearly the relationship between pain and śamatha, and I know that the Buddha himself (and there is no greater "Dzogchen master" than Śakyamuni Buddha in our epoch) relied on dhyāna to refresh himself and to deal with his own physical pain as he got older and older:

"It is, Ananda, only when the Tathagata, disregarding external objects, with the cessation of certain feelings, attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind, [19] that his body is more comfortable.

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... .vaji.html

I also am not someone who just goes by the Holy Word as reported by my fellow coreligionists. While Dzogchen has its own characteristic practices, its assumptions about the mind and body are Buddhist assumptions, and fit within the boundaries of Buddhist discourse, practice and expectations very comfortably, are based upon them, or in dialogue with them.

This is anecdotal. 

When you examine the bstan 'gyur, you will discover that there is almost nothing mentioned about the three turnings. The passage in the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra about three turnings was ignore Asanga in his commentary on the sūtra. The other commentary, by Jn̄̄ānagarbha, also ignores the three turnings. It appears obvious then that this tiny section of the sūtra in question are regarded as being of little importance by Indian masters in India. 

The notion of three turnings as a major device for interpreting sūtras was introduced to Tibet in the massive commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra by the Korean master་་Won-ch'uk.  However, this is almost entirely ignored in Chinese Buddhism as well which seems to generally follow the Tientai school for dating and evaluating sūtras. 

Madhyamikas would never accept this scheme since they regarded the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra a provisional sūtra from the get go, and their criteria for evaluating definitive vs. provisional sūtras comes from the Akṣayamtinirdeśasūtra. 

But this is all massively off topic.

Sociologically, in Tibetan society, Ngakpas fill the role taken by Brahmin priests in Indian society.  The reason for this is that the rise of Buddhist Tantra in Indian involved lay and ordained Buddhists competing with Brahmins in the same roles, officiating at burnt offering rites, and so on. We can, for example, find sustained arguments by Indian Buddhists for why Buddhist burnt offering rites are more effect then their brahmanical counterparts. 

That said, there is very little market for the skills of Ngakpas in the West, and I doubt there will ever be much of one. I don't think, in the context of Western Buddhism, we are ever going to see many Ngakpas in traditional gear. There will always be some, but not many. 

That said, some people find it helpful to wear robes when they practice -- but this is really no different than Zen people who like to wear Zen gear when they practice ——&nbsp;it sets a tone, a mood, a purpose. 

Personally, apart from not cutting my hair, I don't really hold much with wearing Ngakpa gear. Putting on and taking off special clothes to practice Dharma just seems a bother to me. But then, I am very lazy. I have, however, been known to wear a stripped robe on special occasions.

Personally, I don't like directed thought and evaluation, but that is just a translation choice. In the Mahāyāna commentaries. they are generally glossed as a course and subtle attention.

It maintains vicara however, because in the first Dhyāna one can still change one's focus.

Correct, physical pain can be felt by someone who has knowledge of the basis, but who is not residing in a moment of unfabricated consciousness. 

Physical pain cannot be felt by someone who is residing in the dhyānas or who is in a state of perfect śamatha. In this case, the only difference between a perfect śamatha and "instant presence" is whether that person has Dzogchen view or not. Dzogchen is many wonderful things, but it does not eliminate the framework of how karma functions, how mental factors function, and how śamatha functions and so on. Some people (not you) seem to think that Dzogchen is a "get out of Buddhism free" card. It isn't.

The reason I referenced ChNN's medical issues last year is that some people think that Rinpoche is in instant presence 24/7/365. He isn't, by his own admission.

The six liberations are liberation through sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind. 

The last is for practitioners, the others are for non-practitioners. 

If you are a serious Dzogchen practitioner it is 100% guaranteed that you will attain buddhahood either in this life, the bardo, or the next life (in the nirmanakāya buddhafields if you do not find time to practice much in this life but possess the instructions and understand them) depending on your diligence. If you are not so serious, but have faith in Dzogchen teachings, than it is certain you will obtain buddhahood within a few lifetimes. 

Why do I say this? It is because this is what is said in all of the six major commentaries we have on the 17 tantras, as well as what is said in the 17 tantras themselves.

The five factors of the first dhyana are initial attention (vitarka), sometimes also referred to as coarse attention; vicara, sustained attention; sukha, i.e. physical ease; priti, i.e. mental ease, and one-pointedness. These are all described by Vasubandhu, and Rongzom does not differ in the way he uses these terms. He argues that whether one is doing ordinary śamatha or vipaśyāna or mantra practice is not important; what is important is developing the base of the first dhyāna/perfect śamatha using either method within the context of maintaining Dzogchen view.

"Samadhi is a neutral mental factor possessed by all minds," is a basic definition from Abhidharma. 

When Rinpoche discusses "contemplation," he most frequently resorts to an example from the Samadhirāja Sūtra which maintains that a second of samadhi purifies more karma than eons of merit based practices. 

All sentient beings have samadhi, it is what they so with it that determines whether they continue in samsara or achieve awakening; there are mundane samadhis and transcendent samadhis and so on.

The presence or absence of Buddhadharma in the world is dependent on the presence or absence of the world's merit. When the world's merit is in decline, Buddhadharma declines, for example, we can see this with nations. As Tibet's merit as a nation declined, so too did Buddhadharma decline in that nation and the institutions which acted as supports for Buddhadharma also became increasingly corrupted, such as the tulku system, the monastic system, and so on.

Sogyal may very well be the Harvey Weinstein of Tibetan Buddhism, but not everything he has done or sponsored is entirely bad. 

I know it is fashionable now in the days of the #metoo movement to boycott anything and everything someone accused of sexual misconduct may have been involved with, but I think that it is extremely short-sighted, a bandaid, not a cure. 

Also, I am quite certain that Rigpa will survive Sogyal. There are literally thousands of people who don't care if or don't believe that Sogyal has actually done anything wrong. And Sogyal has colon cancer -- it is highly unlikely that he will last out another decade.

Observing that it may be a compassionate outcome for a person to spend some time incarcerated for a crime they have been convicted of is a far cry from praying for someone's incarceration.  

Why would it be compassionate? In order to prevent them from committing other similar crimes. As I observed, however, Sogyal has yet to be brought up on criminal charges. The way it works in a Democracy is that everyone is entitled to their day in court. Jane Doe had her day and opted for payment rather than punishment, probably because her lawyer advised her to take the settlement rather than get bogged down in a lengthy court case with a less than certain outcome.

Anyway, you will have to be satisfied with the endless humiliation of Sogyal in the press and on boards such as these since it is highly unlikely he will be successfully brought up on charges. Being satisfied with the humiliation of a sentient being is also not very Buddhist.

We can address the issues of patriarchy and sexual abuse in Buddhist organizations without indulging in afflictive behavior ourselves, or at least we can recognize the afflictions that the perceived misdeeds of others raise within ourselves.

And if you accept rebirth, do you really believe that in some past life you have not done things far more awful to women than the crimes you impute onto  Sogyal? I am pretty sure we have all been perps and victims, over and over again...

In reality, the Buddha said almost nothing about family life. He said absolutely nothing about monogamy, promiscuity, and so on. Why? These things belong to worldly social customs and really have nothing do with Dharma.

That is just fine. Not everyone has the same cycle of elements, mewas, parkha and so on. And, karma trumps astrology.

No, if you were born in a dog year, the dog year is your obstacle year. In Tibetan astrology, you are 1 year old the day you are born. Let's say you were born on the last day of this year, the fire bird year. On the first day of the following year, the earth dog year, you would be 2. Your thirteenth year would be the next bird year, that would be your obstacle year. Your 7-off side year would be the next rabbit year, which is the enemy of bird, another obstacle year. There are generally two obstacle years per 12 year cycle, your rang lo, or the animal year of your birth and the seventh year from that birth year.

It does not matter when in the centipede year you were born, if you were born the day before the centipede year becomes the millipede year, you are still a centipede and it is still your obstacle year from new years onward.

Gopa was the principle wife, Yaśodharā was the mother of Rahula, and Mrigajā was the third wife. There are other sūtras that mention six wives.

The point of this exercise of course is to dispel the notion that the Buddha advocated the "traditional family" based on Western monogamous values.

Just to add a bit more here, the Abhiniṣkramaṇa-sūtra states that the Buddha had three main wives, Gopa, Yaśodharā, and Mrigajā, as well as 60,000 other wives, that is to say, 20,000 wives as the retinue for the three main wives. Buddha's palace was literally crawling with wives.

No, the Buddha had at least two wives, and according to some sources, three; as well as many mistresses. The Lalitavistara reports he had a wife named Gopa, who was his head wife:

Then indeed, in order to conform to worldly conventions, the Bodhisattva dwelt among 84,000 women and showed himself to partake of the amorous games with pleasure. Among the 84,000 women, the Śākya girl Gopā was consecrated as the foremost wife.

"Traditional" marriage exists in many forms: polygamy, polyandry, monogamy, and everything in between.

Content:
Not with respect to Kālacakra, however —— the text itself indicates that the Shambhala war, which is mostly discussed in chapter 5, the so-called Wisdom chapter, is symbolic. In the inner chapter it also states very clearly that the war visited upon the mlecchas will be a vast illusion where it seems that there is killing and so on, but in reality it is all an illusion conjured to intimidate the mlecchas in Baghdad, and no one is actually harmed.

Actually, one should completely avoid any teacher who is into the narrative that a guru's job is to mess with their student's egos. It simply does not help the student on the path of liberation and in fact, often causes a lot of damage in the process.  

A guru's job is to teach a path, not act as an impromptu shrink who completely lacks any professional training.
