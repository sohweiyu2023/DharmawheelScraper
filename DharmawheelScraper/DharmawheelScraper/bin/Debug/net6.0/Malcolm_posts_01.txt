In this case, yes, gdangs. For when example, the essence, nature, and compassion are described, the essence is emptiness (stong pa), the nature is clarity (gsal ba), and compassion is cognizance (rig pa).

When one is just resting in the six senses, there is no outward straying, inward withdrawal, nor remaining the middle. The five sense contact their objects, thus there are appearances, but there is no reification about these appearances, for example, "this is originally pure" and so on. The minute one enters into dualism, "I am over here, the appearance is over there" the imputing ignorance kicks into play and one is lost in dualistic vision. Those appearances are part of "the radiance of rig pa" a.k.a "the potential of compassion," when they are recognized for what they are, gradually one integrates with this.

When one is distracted, the potential of compassion becomes the six intellects; when one is not distracted, it is just the potential of compassion. The path of the dzogchen yogi is just the potential, rtsal.

No, they can’t. In highest yoga tantra, what they call “rainbow body” is a specific effect of the completion stage; in dzogchen, it arises because of an explicit understanding of how to reverse the reification of material appearances into pristine consciousness.

As It Is vol. 2, “Iron Rod Technique,” pg. 69:

"If you want to totally stop encountering anything, and experience no mind, perceive no appearances, have your friend give you a hard whack over the head. Then you will succeed, at least for a while. When both thinking and perception cease, there is the state we call 'utter oblivion', which is mindless and without thought. That state resembles the original cause of ignorance. When both the thinking and the perceived are halted, your samsaric state is only put on pause, on hold. 

[...}If your training is for the purpose of bringing thinking and experience to a halt, you must have somebody knock you out. If you prefer you could also do it by yourself. You don't need to have somebody else knock you out. Every time you wake up, take hold of the iron bar, if that's your training, and knock yourself out. You could get quite good at it after a while! This is quite easy to accomplish. As soon as you regain your senses and start to have one thought, immediately hit yourself on the head! Your meditation aid would be the iron bar. This will help you to reach the ultimate stupidity! If you want to bring both sensations and thoughts to a halt use the iron bar. This was the pointing-out instruction for the stupid state of complete oblivion."

Sort of…instead thoughts become objects (they already are), since they are nothing other than the radiance of vidya. That’s why, even in a state of rig pa, one can drive, talk, pay bills, eat, use a restroom, etc. it’s not like being in a state of rig pa induces cushion paralysis.

This needs a bit of clarification. Longchenpa states in the Lama Yangthig, Stainless Space:

When mind comes and goes, vidyā is not truly evident. When vidyā remains in its own radiance, mind is not evident, seeming as though when one arises, the other ceases. However, when vidyā is stable, because the radiance of vidyā dissolves into the basis, mind ceases for a moment...When the mind arises, the radiance is evident; because the state of vidyā is not evident, it seems to have ceased (although it does not cease, since it does not arise or cease). 

That being so, it is very important to distinguish mind and pristine consciousness because all meditation is just that: all methods of purifying vāyu and vidyā are that; and in the end at the time of liberation, vidyā is purified of all obscurations because it is purified of the mind. The transcendent state abides as kāyas and pristine consciousness, and all critical points meet there.


And:

At that time, mental appearances and traces of the body, speech and mind are self-purified since one remains in vidyā’s own state. Since vidyā does not move, one is liberated from the minds of the desire realm. Since not even clarity is apprehended, one is liberated from the minds of form realm. Even though one is without concepts, since the radiance of vidyā unceasingly appears as objects, one is liberated from the minds of the formless realm.

What you are calling "thoughts" is just the radiance of rig pa. When that radiance wanders towards objects, it becomes mind, and then there are concepts. Once that radiance has been recognized, thoughts only happen when one is distracted. The proof that one is utterly undistracted, as Longchenpa points out, is the body of light:

However, when vidyā is stable, because the radiance of vidyā dissolves into the basis, mind ceases for a moment. The ordinary physical body dissolves into light, or when it is cast aside, since the breath stops, the body stops.

This is just a form of apophatic mysticism. The argument that something is valid because it is beyond the conceptual mind is incoherent. 

Asserting that the nature of the mind (tathāta) is not empty, while the mind itself is empty, is also incoherent.

If by the “non-emptiness of buddha nature” you are asserting buddha nature is something that is truly established, your view is no better than the view of nonBuddhists. If by the “non-emptiness of buddha nature” you simply mean that emptiness of suchness is also not truly established, than this fault is avoided.

Pristine consciousness is the basis, but it also is not a truly established entity. The basis itself is baseless and has no foundation. Whatever qualities or faults that  arise from it are equally the same. It is this point that renders Dzogchen more profound than the Uttaratantra.

It is not an approach: the mind is just the radiance of rig pa mixed with karma vāyus. When those vāyus subside, so does the mind. When those vayus are active, also the mind is active. 

The point you fail to recognize, or have not been shown, is that once the radiance of rig pa has been exposed and identified for what it is, whether there are thoughts or not does not matter, just as one is able to identify someone's face in a crowd after one has been introduced to them. Further you are apparently unaware of the method of using strong concepts, like hatred, to expose rig pa.

Why don't you take a look at the passage ChNN is referencing? However, the passage is not exactly what ChNN represents it to be in Mipham's text.  

In Speech of Delight, pg. 125-134, you will find that Mipham is equating several scholars view of freedom from extremes (spros bral): Longchenpa, Gorampa, Marpa, Milarepa, Sapan, Tsongkhapa, Rangjung Dorje, Dolbupa, and Taranatha in that order. I have already pointed out that Dolbupa and other gzhan stong pas agree equipoise can only be free from all proliferation. Since other-emptiness is a post-equipoise view, it is necessarily conceptual.  Mipham also claims that the post-equipoise view of gzhan stong is analytical (133). This passage is also the sole passage where sugatagarbha is mentioned in the whole text.

Mipham then goes on to diplomatically discuss skillful means, and the necessity of teaching different sorts of teachings to different beings. 

Moreover, in 1993, Conway, when discussing the Sakya master Mangtho, normally considered a gzhan stong pa, ChNN stated clearly that while there were similarities with gzhan stong in terms of the idea that the three kāyas were present in the basis, he distinguished Dzogchen from gzhan stong by point out that in Dzogchen the three kāyas are just potentials which require secondary conditions for manifestation, just as he does in the passage you mention here. 

Finally, Mipham declares on page 84/85, my translation, "Because the intent of Śrī Candra—the profound view in which the biases of false conventions dissolve into the [dharma]dhātu because all these appearances are immediately pure where they are—is equivalent to the way original purity is confirmed in the texts of the Great Perfection, it is endorsed in our own lineage of vidyādharas..."

He earlier clarifies (pg. 75) that Candra's approach, is in his estimation, a cig car ba approach, one of equipoise in the union of two truths, (pg. 151), "There, through the way of the Consequence [prasanga] one gains certainty regarding the final Middle Way that accords with wakefulness [ye shes, gnosis] of equipoise."

The Yogacāra Madhyamaka, he states, is a gradualist presentation. 

Thus, no one can claim that the final view of Nyingma school is not Candra's. We have the evidence of both Longchenpa and Mipham, as well as ChNN on this point.

So unlike your previous assertion that we shouldn't check the explanations of our teachers against the texts that they reference, in fact we actually do need to check their references.

If the first nine examples are taken literally, then yes, there is the problem of atmanavada.

As far as the qualities go, the qualities are clearly explained in the Uttaratantra as being a function of the accumulation of the two heaps. The chapter of qualities clearly outlines the 64 qualities that belong to the three kāyas. If you assert that omniscience of all aspects exist fully formed in sentient beings, you are confronted with the absurdity that sentient beings clearly are not omniscient and so on. There are many other contradictions with the assertion that qualities exist fully formed in the basis, which is dispelled by the fact that basis is not just self-perfected. In the Uttaratantra, these 64 qualities are resultant qualities, not qualities of the basis. 

But of course we can name the cause after the result, since we do this all the time in Buddhadharma. Since the the nature of all sentient beings is nothing other than suchness, when that suchness is realized, being the nature of all phenomena, it is not surprising at all that many qualities of the three kāyas manifest. Since the nature of sentient beings is just suchness, for this reason, tathāgatagarbha doctrine and prasanga are not in contradiction when it is understood that the tathāta of tathātagarbha is just the same suchness that is taught in the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. The two texts even use the same metaphor, space, to describe tathāta. Just as space is the source of all phenomena, likewise, tathāta is the source of all qualities of buddahood, but also, all faults of sentient beings. Just as space is not established substantially or as truly existent, likewise, tathāta itself is not established substantially or as truly existent. The Uttaratantra declares that tathātagarbha is free from all extremes, therefore, rightly understood, it is perfectly consistent with prasangika, and indeed, a prasangika perspective is the only correct approach to this teaching.
