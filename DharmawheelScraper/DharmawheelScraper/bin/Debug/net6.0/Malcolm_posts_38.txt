The distinction is basically this: in cittamatra, phenomena are mental events. The way Lonchenpa explains it is like this. Bodhicitta, awakened mind, is like space, it is the basis, but it is not established in anyway. Its potential or energy [rtsal] arises like the face of a mirror. The display of that potentiality is like the eight examples of illusion. Since the basis, its potential and display are not themselves established because they are all empty, they are nondual. These three are conventionally distinguished because of appearances. Thus, bodhicitta, potentiality and the display are neither single nor plural in terms of their essence, nevertheless, just like the reflections in the mirror cannot be said to be either the same nor different than the mirror's power to reflect, it is understood that the imputations which are the display of the potential of bodhicitta also do not exist either inside or outside of, and hence these appearances are called "nonexistent, clear appearances." Indeed, nothing at all is established in anyway.

He is being naive because there is no samsara without nirvana, and no nirvana without samsara. There is no such a thing as a pure spiritual tradition that exists outside the world. The idea that spiritual traditions should eschew worldly concerns is morally bankrupt, in my opinion, it is a form of impractical utopianism. It is from his utopian stance that he took up the banner of criticizing HHDL for advocating secular ethics to begin with. He does not, and you do not here, seem to understand that it is precisely the world that we have that creates the fertile swamp in which the lotus flower of the Dharma can blossom. Secular ethics in a liberal society give those lotuses the room they need to grow, because you can be sure they will not blossom at all in a fundamentalist Hindu, Jewish, Muslim or Christian society.

Do you see that most humans lack the 18 qualifications that constitute a precious human birth? 

Case closed.

By the way, secular ethics are not "feel good" platitudes. Secular ethics are necessary in order to negotiate fairness and justice between different peoples of different faiths and political orientations. 

Let me give you an example. A number of years ago I was attending a conference at Smith College on Mongolia. As you know, Mongolia is a country where there are a large number of people who follow the practice of Dorje Shugden. A friend of my introduced me to the Secretary General of the Mongolian Consulate to the United States, because he was quite concerned about the Dorje Shugden practice, and felt that is was a large problem in his country. After discussing various problems with the practice and its history, he asked me point blank if Mongolia shouldn't just outlaw the practice. I asked him whether or not Mongolia has a law on the books about freedom of religion, and indeed it does. I pointed out to him that in this case, a country which believes in separation of Church and State cannot be involved in banning this or that religion. You will be shocked to learn that I said to him that this kind of policy could not happen in Mongolia, that the Mongolian Gvt. would be wrong to ban Shugden practice because they value religious freedom and so forth. He was not terribly happy with my answer, but he understood it. 

You see, the point is that is an instance of secular ethics, the separation of church and state are vital to everyone's freedom. A liberal open society requires a firm grounding in secular ethics for the benefit of everyone. Secular ethics are the foundation of the liberal state, they are the foundation of any open society. Thus, even though I personally think the practice of Dorje Shugden is harmful and deeply misguided, by the same token, in a liberal state, an open society, I have no choice but to accept that there are those who wish to perform this practice because of their religious beliefs. 

You yourself invoked a separation of Dharma and politics. This is not a value that comes from the Dharma, this is a secular value, which finds its roots in the establishment clause of the first amendment of the US Constitution. Your and my best hope for religious freedom, economic wellbeing and justice is based precisely on the very secular ethics you are deriding. In other words, when you live in a pluralistic, diverse society like the US and Europe, one has no choice but to develop a strong and robust framework of secular ethics. It is absolutely necessary for everyone's wellbeing.

Mind-only refers only to the container universe, including bodies; it does not mean that other's minds are only your mind. Relatively speaking, i.e. false relative truth, there are still outer appearances, etc. True relative truth is that all these external appearances are just activated traces in the mind. Ultimate truth is that even mind is not established as truly existent and real.

It is important to understand that in old Tibet there were no real laws per se that governed the behavior of people outside of Lhasa. There were very few courts, and aristocrats had a very free hand to dispense punishments pretty much as they saw fit. Those punishments were often cruel by modern standards, but certainly not by seventeenth and eighteenth century standards. Tibet was largely governed by custom and local councils.

Banditry was a family business in much of Eastern Tibet, right up through the 1950's. Paltrul Rinpoche's brother in fact was one of the most famous bandits in Tibetan history.

Tibet was not a Shangri-lha, but it was also not the medieval hell some leftist writers have tried to make out. It was like anywhere else humans have lived. People like to think that because the Tibetans preserved the Dharma it is a "nicer" place —&nbsp;but I think they would be in for a rude surprise. We mainly know Tibet from the point of view of an educated elite. We have very little knowledge of the subaltern Tibet, the Tibet of illiterate farmers, wives, merchants, hunters, soldiers, prostitutes, criminals and bandits. The fact that our main window into old Tibet is through the window of the elite skews our view quite a bit.

It was more streamlined, i.e., men pretty much raped whoever they wanted. Rape has been a huge cultural problem in Tibet for millenia. This is nothing new. Nuns in particular were targets for rape. Deal with it.

Tibetan aristocrats did whatever they wanted to poor people with no remedy. This is a fact. I have had long conversations about this with Tibetan Lamas raised in Tibet. Tibet was just a human land and the things aristocrats would do to poor people were nothing short of unbelievably barbaric as well as widespread and systematic.

You should read Nature's God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic. It may cause you to revise your opinion. 

...the most popular narrative concerning the very idea of America— one that unites Christian nationalists with a large number of sober historians— has it that the American Republic owes its independence and its individual freedoms to its Protestant Christian legacy. 86 This narrative often comes with a distinguished lineage that traces the ideas of individual rights and freedom of conscience to seminal Protestant thinkers such as John Milton (1608– 1674), and it characteristically represents Jefferson, Madison, and precursors like Locke as latitudinarian Protestants or (to use a label that at the time would have sounded like a gross oxymoron) “Christian Deists.” 87 But this gets the history of ideas almost exactly wrong. It is to confuse mere precedence in time with causality. It is to suppose, falsely, that the ideas that best explain the actions of a collective are those that a majority of people within it pretend to carry around in their heads. Reformed religion brought carnage to Britain and Germany in the seventeenth century and madness to America in the eighteenth because it was a symptom of modernity, not a cause— a pathology, not a theory.

Stewart, Matthew (2014-07-01). Nature's God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic (pp. 72-73). W. W. Norton &amp; Company. Kindle Edition. 

And:

For the further clarification of the meaning of this “Religion of Nature’s God,” he referred his readers to “[ Alexander] Pope’s little Essay on Man, confessedly deduced from the inspiration of Lord Bolingbroke, and perhaps every sentence adopted by me.” In some alternate universe— such as perhaps the one constructed from the nationalist myths that have long gripped American historiography— Young’s peculiar “Religion of Nature’s God” might have amounted to little more than a historical oddity. It was just the cloudy reflection of a disturbing individual who was always fishing in troubled waters. To judge from the hate that filled the newspapers of the time, it was a quite unpopular form of belief, deeply at odds with all the accepted varieties of the Christian religion. Yet the curious fact is that Young, like Allen, manifestly saw his unusual religion as an intimate component of the revolutionary political struggle in which he was engaged. The rights he claimed on behalf of his countrymen against the British Parliament and even against the Crown itself were not the rights guaranteed to Englishmen by their constitution, nor the rights due to Christians, but the rights deriving from the laws of nature and of “Nature’s God.” And Young and Allen were far from alone in their revolutionary theology. Indeed, “Nature’s God” was the presiding deity of the American Revolution. Franklin invoked it in his newspaper articles as early as 1747.

Stewart, Matthew (2014-07-01). Nature's God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic (p. 138). W. W. Norton &amp; Company. Kindle Edition. 


And:

In most versions of America’s revolutionary history, the term “deism,” if it appears at all, is taken to refer to a superficial theological doctrine about a “watchmaker God” who fashions a world of mechanical wonders and then walks away to the sound of ticking noises. Deism, according to this line of interpretation, was just a watery expression of the Christian religion, adulterated somewhat with the platitudes of the Enlightenment. It was the opposite of atheism, as the dictionary tells us, and it should count as thumpingly religious by modern standards. It arose in Britain around the turn of the eighteenth century and arrived in America in a moderate and conciliatory mood, quite different from the atheistic Enlightenment that took hold in France and elsewhere. The informed consensus today further supposes that deism was a detachable doctrine, present to some degree among the educated elites in revolutionary America, but only incidentally connected with the political ideology of its revolutionaries. All of this, I now think, is not quite right. “Deism” in its own day referred not to a superficial theological doctrine but to a comprehensive intellectual tradition that ranged freely across the terrain we now associate with ethics, political theory, metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and epistemology. It was an astonishingly coherent and systematic body of thought, closer to a way of being than any particular dogma, and it retained its essential elements over a span of centuries, not decades. In origin and substance, deism was neither British nor Christian, as the conventional view supposes, but largely ancient, pagan, and continental, and it spread in America far beyond the educated elite. Although America’s revolutionary deists lavished many sincere expressions of adoration upon their deity, deism is in fact functionally indistinguishable from what we would now call “pantheism”; and pantheism is really just a pretty word for atheism. While deism could often be associated with moderation in politics, it served principally to advance a system of thought that was revolutionary in its essence and effects. This essentially atheistic and revolutionary aspect of deism, I further contend, is central to any credible explanation of the revolutionary dimension of the American Revolution.

Declaration of Independence:

When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

It is not preposterous when you understand that the word "sacred" does not really map well to Tibetan or even Buddhist ideas about things. 

We constantly impute/inflict our own linguistic assumptions on cultures outside our own. As much as I am pretty conversant in Tibetan language and sciences such as medicine, astrological calculation and so on, culturally speaking I am an outsider looking into Tibetan culture [as distinct from Dharma] through the window of their language and texts. As an outsider, it is important that I am aware of my own penchant to impute/inflict concepts and so on onto Tibetans they just don't share with Anglo-American culture. 

This is one of the reasons I am so opposed to using language in translations that is saturated with native meaning for English speakers that does not reflect implications of a given term in the source language —&nbsp;in this case Tibetan. I gave an example, i.e. translating the Tibetan term gzhi, basis, as "ground of being", a theological term largely coined by the Catholic Theologian, Paul Tillich that has no meaning nor corollary in Buddhist discourse. 

All the terms we might wish to gloss as "sacred" generally mean high, supreme, sublime, glorious, and so on, much more than they match our concept of "sacred" or "holy".

With regard to your last comment, "sacred outlook" does not work for dag snang. You do not need to consecrate anything to have dag snang. Dag snang is self-arising. You cannot fabricate dag snang. 

Stupas, relics, temples, are sacred precisely because they are "set apart," nevertheless, there still is no Buddhist word of which I am aware that maps to "sacred". 

OED:

sacred |ˈsākrid|
adjective
connected with God (or the gods) or dedicated to a religious purpose and so deserving veneration: sacred rites | the site at Eleusis is sacred to Demeter.
• religious rather than secular: sacred music.
• (of writing or text) embodying the laws or doctrines of a religion: a sacred Hindu text.
• regarded with great respect and reverence by a particular religion, group, or individual: an animal sacred to Mexican culture.
• sacrosanct: to a police officer nothing is sacred.

The nearest Tibetan word that overlaps might be "lha" in some of its uses, like "lha chos", for example.

It is not really a Buddhist word — I can't think of a single Buddhist term in either Sanskrit or Tibetan that truly maps to this term in the way it is used in English.

One does not need a method to develop love and compassion other than recognizing suffering and having the desire to do something to alleviate it as much as possible. Quite honestly, I know a lot of religious people who don't do shit to help others, Buddhists included, who spend all their time arguing about religion and praying rather than getting off their assess and helping others. I know a lot of completely non-religious people who devote their lives to helping others, and frankly, I know more of the latter who are actively engaged in helping others than the former. 

[qupte]
 Those people who already have highly developed love and compassion have so because they met a spiritual path in the past and were able to practise moral discipline and meditations to improve their love and compassion. If there is no method there is no practice and no success. Just telling people to be good doesn't work.[/quote]

From the point of view of the narrative we follow, this makes sense. But it does not make sense to people who have not drunk the Buddhist koolaid and there is no good reason on earth that we should try and force people to accept our views.

Sure it will. Humanism encourages people to develop compassion and love for others, and encourages them to avoid non-virtues of body, voice and mind. This will cause them to accumulate merit and continue to take rebirth in higher realms. This is precisely the vehicle of gods and men that the Buddha taught, for example, in the famed Kalamas Sutta.

The three series do not mean that for example, man ngag sde is "superior" to the other two, though in fact it has been interpreted that way. The reality of it is that they focus on different aspects of Dzogchen teachings. 

The preliminaries are for those who have not yet understood what the primordial state is. Tregchö and thogal are inseparable: sometimes however, tregchö&nbsp;is parsed as "sudden" and thögal as "gradual", but this too is in reality misleading.

The long and short of it is that Dzogchen teachings did not fit in the mold of gradual and sudden dichotomy [which is a conversation is only tangentially relevant to Dzogchen due to the conflict in Tibet over Indian and Chinese approaches to Mahāyāna sūtra]. They also do not fit into the mold of ultimate and relative truths. They do not fit into the mold of paths and stages.

According to Mipham:

Further, in the Dharma in which all desires of the world are mastered and is also the supreme of abundance, not covered by any faults like a lotus, one’s conduct does not avoid anything. The reason for that is that there is no true difference between all faults and qualities, they are similar and not distinct, abiding in sameness.

The Innermost Great Potentiality states:

In the dhātu of all outer and inner phenomena,
the pure experiential field,
buddhas and sentient beings are nondual,
how can there be fabrication with a path?

The inner potentiality which does not need to be accomplished is free from aspiration, 
it has already been naturally completed without activity. 

The Soaring Garuda states:

The illness of those entering the path that is not a path is great;
those who wish to arrive are like wild animals chasing a mirage. 

Since there is no object to attain, there is nothing other than the three realms. 
Even relying on the tenth bhumi is an obstruction to awakening. 

The Cuckoo of Vidyā states:

The primal nature of diversity is also nondual, 
in reality, free from the proliferation of partiality.

As I said, not exactly. 

The aggregates are a product of mind, correct? Mind is deluded correct? What a deluded mind perceives is a delusion, correct? 

Ye shes is a product of rig pa, correct? Rig pa is undeluded, correct? What undeluded rig pa perceives is not a delusion, correct? 

As the Pellucid Transcendent State[/i [dgongs pa zang thal] tells us, there is one basis, two paths, and two results. At the end of one of those paths lies the five aggregates and samsara; and at the end of the other path is the five wisdoms and nirvana. 

However, there is a way in which phenomena of samsara and the phenomena of nirvana are the same, as Mañjuśrīmitra declares:

Therefore, because awakening and nonawakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.

So therefore:

[It is the Dharma] in which one abides in sameness, like the supreme lotus of the world, not avoiding anything. 

And:

Abide in sameness without imputing duality, free from speech, nothing to do or to not do, nothing to accumulate or reduce. 

And of course, it goes without saying we need to be careful about being arrogant about what we think we understand. As Mañjuśrimitra states:

The pride of promoting one’s understanding and lording it over all,
giving rise to attachment and aversion, is ignorance which does not see the meaning, producing conflict. 

Mipham futher clarifies this:

If one engages in grasping such as, “Freedom from all views is seeing the ultimate meaning,” promoting the idea, “My understanding is the realization of the truth” and lording it over all, the pride caused by that view, causing attachment to one’s own views and aversion towards views of others, is ignorance which produces conflicts. Since there is no so-called “truth” or “falsity”, holding onto one’s view as true and holding onto the views of others as false are thoughts that does not correspond to the way both exist. Therefore, the authentic meaning of not perceiving either true nor false is not seen.

There is a long discussion about this in the analytical philosophy tradition. Rawls in part answers your question:

The religious doctrines that in previous centuries were the professed basis of society have gradually given way to principles of constitutional government that all citizens, whatever their religious view, can endorse. Comprehensive philosophical and moral doctrines likewise cannot be endorsed by citizens generally, and they also no longer can, if they ever could, serve as the professed basis of society. Thus, political liberalism looks for a political conception of justice that we hope can gain the support of an overlapping consensus of reasonable religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines in a society regulated by it. Gaining this support of reasonable doctrines lays the basis for answering our second fundamental question as to how citizens, who remain deeply divided on religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines, can still maintain a just and stable democratic society. To this end, it is normally desirable that the comprehensive philosophical and moral views we are wont to use in debating fundamental political issues should give way in public life. Public reason—citizens’ reasoning in the public forum about constitutional essentials and basic questions of justice—is now best guided by a political conception the principles and values of which all citizens can endorse (VI). That political conception is to be, so to speak, political and not metaphysical.

Political liberalism, then, aims for a political conception of justice as a freestanding view. It offers no specific metaphysical or epistemological doctrine beyond what is implied by the political conception itself. As an account of political values, a free-standing political conception does not deny there being other values that apply, say, to the personal, the familial, and the associational; nor does it say that political values are separate from, or discontinuous with, other values. One aim, as I have said, is to specify the political domain and its conception of justice in such a way that its institutions can gain the support of an overlapping consensus. In this case, citizens themselves, within the exercise of their liberty of thought and conscience, and looking to their comprehensive doctrines, view the political conception as derived from, or congruent with, or at least not in conflict with, their other values.

It is not me who is saying that, it is Vimalamitra who is saying that in several books, not just one. You can accept or reject whatever you like. 

If it makes you happy to insist on adding lhun grub, ok, but it isn't necessary. The Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:

The basis is called “great original purity” which is present as the essence, nature and compassion. The pristine consciousness of the unchanging essence manifests without impediment and is called “the reality of the youthful vase body.” The nature is the unimpeded five lights. For example, the appearance of compassion is like the absence of clouds. That is called “the reality of original purity,” i.e. unlimited and not falling into any position

And:

One will be liberated on the ultimate stage of original purity.

And:

Next, the absence of anything higher than the pristine consciousness
that naturally arises on the stage of original purity is the
attainment of the sixteen stage, Highest Wisdom.

And the String of Pearls Tantra states:

Everything actualizes buddhahood in the state
of original purity free from taints.

The Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra states:

Further, when the mind is ripened,
the basis is present in the dharmakāya,
the taints upon original purity are exhausted
and the essence has never been deluded.

Vimalamitra states:

The basis, the state of initial original purity, is liberated
because its essence is not established at all.
Its nature appears as everything
and its compassion arises in every way.

It is pretty clear to me that the intention of the 17 Tantras is that the basis is ka dag, original purity.

Addressing your concern, he continues:

Since the six assertions about the basis are recognized as the potential of original purity, the practice of the faultless philosophical tenet is like explaining Vajrāsana having been there. That is without error. In addition, it is so because the explanatory description is faultless. People who follow philosophical tenets can only partially explain how the six assertions about the basis are defective.

In other words, it is recognized that the other six positions about the basis, while faulty, do indeed address an aspect of the potentiality of original purity. Nevertheless, only describing the basis as original purity is considered absolutely faultless from the point of view of the system of Dzogchen laid out in the 17 Tantras.

Maybe the problem here is that your understanding of original purity is too confined to the emptiness aspect. Original purity has essence, nature and compassion. It has the three kāyas. Why? Because it is dharmakāya. There is no dharmakāya without the other two.

Sūtra in general belongs to the path of renunciation — this is the main method of practice. 

Tantra in general belongs to the path of transformation —&nbsp;using the creation stage and completion stage and so on, generating oneself as the deity, reciting mantras, transforming one's impure dimension into a pure one. 

Dzogchen is path of liberation or self-liberation, where one does not need to apply any sort of antidote, either in terms of renunciation or transformation. Instead phenomena are allowed to self-liberate just a they are by recognizing one's primordial state and integrating with that. Apart from Norbu Rinpoche's teachings, the place where these three paths are most clearly explained is in the Zhang Zhung sNyan rgyud teachings belonging to the Bon school, especially the outer cycle:


Now then, the first, the path of renunciation, gives up the ten nonvirtues and accomplishes the ten virtues. The result is asserted to be buddhahood after many lives and eons. That is the path of causal characteristics. 

Second, the so called “path of transformation” of result secret mantra is transforming the outer universe into a celestial mansion, transforming the inhabitants into gods and goddesses, transforming the five samsaya substances into the five ambrosias, transforming the five aggregates into the five deities and transforming the five afflictions into the five wisdoms. This is asserted as buddhahood, being the path of result secret mantra. 

However, neither the path of renunciation nor the past of transformation will be explained here. What it to be explained here now is the inseparability of cause and result in the great vehicle. 

In the explanation of the so called “path of great self liberation with nothing to accept or reject” samsara and nirvana, existence and nonexistence, the duality of permanence and annihilation, the duality of happiness and suffering, the duality of attachment and aversion, the five afflictions, the eight consciousnesses, all appearances of deluded concepts of subject and object are not abandoned and are not to be abandoned. Since everything arises from the mind, in the sole unique sphere, abandonment and accepting do not exist as a duality. Therefore, everything that arises self-arises, everything that is liberated is self-liberated, therefore it is termed “the path of liberation.”

They are taken directly from the book, Buddhahood in This Life [to be published by Wisdom next year], where the author, Vimalamitra, runs through the seven positions of the basis, and identifies the position of the basis as ka dag as the only faultless one. This is a summary of an extensive section in the commentary of the Kun bzang klong drug tantra. Vimalamitra does not go into it further because, as he says, it is mostly an intellectual discussion, not for practitioners. 

Ka dag does not mean only emptiness, though sometimes people misunderstand it that way Ka dag refers to the fact that reality has always been pure, never affected by ignorance and so on. This is why it is the basis, and not lhun grub.

That being said, the difference between Dzogchen and sūtra Dharmas is that in sūtra Dharmas no methods are explained how to achieve the result they describe, apart from the lengthy and forbidding paths and stages.

No. Why? Defining the basis as kadag is the position of the 17 tantras. The other six are are the partial positions. 

As Vimalamitra/Nyibum states:


First, establishing original purity as faultless. Dharmatā, original purity, is free from all proliferation. Since it is unaffected by ignorance, it is free from all obscurations...

Now comes the intrinsic characteristics of the faultless position, the actual extensive explanation of the reality of original purity. The reality of the original basis that exists permeated with the intrinsic nature of the three pristine consciousnesses, essence, nature and compassion, is the inwardly illuminated original purity...

The basis is not possible if it is not originally pure.

The proof text he uses, among others, is the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra:

Also, the basis of great original purity
is endowed with essence, nature and compassion.

Yes. But in fact my afflictions are my own, so even if you were fully realized in this lifetime fully, the state called Phowa Chenpo, great transference, you would still appear to me in an ordinary form. 

It is well known that the traces in the mind streams of all sentient beings are all that hold this mundane appearance together. These traces are even strong enough to generate appearances for other sentient beings, such as the container universe and the beings in it. These traces come from ignorance. Ignorance comes from not recognizing our primordial state. Dzogchen practice is how that ignorance is reversed. 

As Mañjuśrimitra says:

Also, my body appears as the infinite worlds and bodies of living beings.
The mind and traces are not the same, not different and are very hard to investigate.

However, in reality as he says:

The mind that clings to entities and clings to cause and result
itself appears as cause and condition, but because those are nondual, there is no arising and perishing. 
Because there is no arising and perishing, there is no self and other. Because there is no death and transmigration, there is no permanence and annihilation. 
Therefore, there is no delusion or samsara. In fact, there is also no nirvana. 

From a Dzogchen point of view, even the pure appearance of a Buddha is not real. As he says:

Because the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion.

While there is no mention of Prasanga or Svatantra in the Tarkajvala, it does mentions a great Madhyamaka. However, that "great Madhyamaka" is defined by how it treats relative truth, i.e. mind only. Coarse outer Madhyamaka treats relative truth in the manner of the Sarvastivadins and so on. 

In general, Dudjom Rinpoche repeats an error universally common in Tibetan Buddhism scholastics, and it is by no means confined to him. That is, he cites a version of citation that has been passed down to him in an altered or truncated form without checking the original text to see if it is accurate.

Content:
The term "mind" in English is a container metaphor. "What I have in mind...", "The thought arose in my mind..."

Consciousness on the other hand is not a container metaphor, it is a description of the awareness a mind has, dating no earlier than Locke. 

In reality, "mind" comes from PIE, *men, leading to Latin mēns:

mind
intellect
reasoning, judgement

The actual word "mind: comes from is Proto-Germanic/gamundiz, leading to old English:

ġemynd:

memory; commemoration:
Heora gemynd is forgiten. The memory of them is forgotten.

thought, thinking

Title: Re: Direct introduction. What is it?
Content:
The term direct introduction is a bit misleading. The term is translated from the tibetan, which is rang ngo thog tu phrad, "directly encounter your own state." This direct introduction or encounter is facilitated by a Guru, but as you correctly note, nothing is transferred per se, because the guru is merely showing you your own face [rang ngo] or your own state [rang ngo] in a direct encounter [thog tu phrad]. This is done on the basis of experiences, as the example of Nyoshul Lungtog's encounter with Patrul Rinpoche:

Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of the mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.

"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side.

Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"
"Yes."

"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"
"Yes."

"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"
"Yes."

"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."

Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."

The sad part is that someone will take this literally, think that they should go somewhere, lie on the ground, listen to dogs bark and think this is direct introduction.

As you know, direct introduction is not introducing you to something you don't have. It is introducing you to something you have always had, and misplaced. This is one reason why the Buddhanature metaphor useful in Dzogchen, but here it means something a bit different than in lower yanas [cue, Son of the Buddha].

For one thing, "pointing out", ngo phrod is generally a Mahāmudra term. Direct introduction, "rang ngo thog du phrad," literally, "directly encountering one's own state" is a Dzogchen term. Granted, even in Dzogchen texts, there are this and that "ngo phrod," there is even an entire tantra devoted to the subject. But direct introduction from a qualified master is the only thing absolutely essential in Dzogchen teachings. Anyone who thinks otherwise has no understanding of Dzogchen at all.

Ivo, as you very well know, the extremely unelaborate empowerment of the four Nyinthig empowerments is precisely a direct introduction. So what are you talking about?

Of course you have to discover Dzogchen knowledge through your own experience, and of course, having been ripened with the rig pa'i rtsal dbang through whichever of the three ways it can be given —&nbsp;pandita style, secret mantra style or pointing out for old ladies —&nbsp; then of course one takes whatever practice texts one needs and goes and does Dzogchen practices such as rushen, etc. and eliminates one's doubts. But the effectiveness of Dzogchen practice comes about through one's interaction with a teacher and practices they give one, not from reading books and developing nice fantasies about what Dzogchen might be based on reading Western translations without a proper teacher. 

People who only read English translations of these texts without access to a Tibetan teacher who can clarify for them what this and that actually means are like blind people in a cave who have been given flashlight with dead batteries to find their way out.

I have been patiently explaining for many days now, ever since steve showed up. Not only myself, but many other people. 

Anyone who has been a student of Norbu Rinpoche for any length of time knows that you really should receive the transmission for any Dzgchen text you wish to study. Dzogchen texts are not meant to be read in absence of proper instruction. Yes, of course, when you know the meaning, then one Dzogchen text is just as good as another, they all have the same meaning more or less, depending on whether we are talking about sems sde, klong sde, or man ngag sde. Still, if you want to really work with a text, then the proper way to do it is to find someone who will teach you the text in a proper way. This was how it was done in Tibet, we are no different today. If you can't find someone to teach you that text, then you find someone who will teach you any text of Dzogchen. The text does not matter, what matters is whether the master has genuine realization of the teachings of Dzogchen.

Rig pa, Ivo, is knowledge, as opposed to ma rig pa, ignorance. 

You seem to be claiming that ordinary people can have knowledge of their primordial state spontaneously. If this were true, there would never have been any need at all for teachers and teachings. 

I have never met one single authentic teacher of Dzogchen who would claim that one could have this experiential knowledge [rig pa] without it having first been introduced to one by a master. 

People can experience the nature of the mind [George] without introduction, just as they can see George on a train everyday without knowing [ma rig pa] who George is. When people are introduced to the knowledge of the nature of the their minds, then we can say they have "rig pa". 

Rig pa and the nature of the mind aka primordial state aka basis, are not the same thing. The fact that people continually conflate these two is unfortunate. But if you pay attention to ChNN, he says repeatedly, "rig pa is not the nature of the mind, rig pa is knowledge or instant presence in the nature of the mind."

Yes, it is just a book, even for an advanced yogi. There is nothing special about a terma text that makes it superior to say a sūtra or a tantra in terms of blessings. This is just superstition. Of course there are some texts that can plant a positive connection in a person's mind so they can make a connection with the lineage at a future time. Even so, texts are always something relative and something quite limited. 

Termas are also part of the oral tradition. They are held to have been orally taught by Padmasambhava [or someone else, like Saraha] to a specific person at a specific time and place, and when they are unpacked by the predicted terton, he again gives the oral transmission as he received it, thus continuing it without a break. Also tertons, by definition, must be realized Dzogchen masters. 

Mahāyāna Sutras are actually termas. So are all Tantras.

Ivo —&nbsp;rig pa is the knowledge of a very specific thing, one's primordial state. This is very, very subtle and cannot be accessed through a coarse mind that is engaged in reading a book, not matter how nice those words are. 

We are talking about a beginner, someone who has never met George. They might see George every day on the subway, but they will never know who George is. However, when they are at last introduced to George by someone who knows George, they will say, "Oh, I see you everyday on the Subway." After that point, they will always recognize George, even if he changes his suit, hat, shoes, etc. But without that introduction, they will never recognize George, and George, being rather disinterested in people, will never walk up and introduce himself, saying, "I am George."

Actually, when using these things, you should be very aware of the environmental impact you are having. For example, in Tibetan Medicine, it is held that one should use medicines from one's region, as these will be the most potent for you. Also, the trees from which gugul, sandalwood oil, myrrh, frankincense, aloes [agar] and so on are extracted endangered. 

In Mexico, there are over 5,000 plant species useful for medicine, and very little of it has been documented in one place, much less made accessible for non-Indians to understand and use. 

As far as Himalayan plants go, however, they have a special potency because of the altitude at which they grow. Alpine instances of a plant are held to be stronger than an instance grown at a lower altitude. Why? Because the distance between flower and root is shorter, and therefore the plant as a whole is held to be more potent.

Title: Re: Sutra: Lung needed or not
Content:
A dhāraṇī, properly speaking, is a formula for recalling the Dharma and developing wisdom and removing nonvirtues which can cause problems.

Generally, we find a description of three mantras: guhyamantras, vidyāmantras and dhāraṇī-mantras. A text called the Abhisamayavibhaṅga by Atisha statesz:

Because of protecting against mundane thoughts with reality, there are so-called secret mantras. As such, because of giving arise to special knowledge when invoked again and again, there are vidyāmantras. In order generate unfailing recollection of bodhicitta, there are dhāraṇī-mantras. 


Further, an interesting text called the sGra sbyor bam po gnyis pa gives the following definitions:

 A so-called mantra is mantregupti bhāśaṇe, i.e. because it is a description of the deities of mantra being summoned and secret, it is called "secret mantra." So-called "vidyā" is vidajñāna: it is name of abiding as the form of a deity in order counteract ignorance. So called "dhāraṇi" is artha granṭha dhārayati dhāraṇi: a name for not forgetting the meaning and the words of Mantra Dharma and obtaining a specific stage, thus, "dhāraṇimantra."

Further, we can make four more distinctions:  dhāraṇis that become the cause of a bodhisattvas obtaining patience, Secret Mantra dhāraṇis, dhāraṇi of Dharma and dhāraṇi of meaning. This distinction is found in the commentary on the Prajñāpāramita by Daṃṣṭrasena. 

The first kind is a result of attaining patience for emptiness because of meditating with wisdom and mindfulness. 

The second is a dhāraṇī mantra that possesses the power of blessings is a dhāraṇī of Secret Mantra because of an aspiration that was made to remove negativities for sentient beings. 

Third, the dhāraṇī of Dharma is when bodhisattvas on the stages listen to buddhas and bodhisattvas no matter how many words of Dharma there are held and recalled with wisdom as they were explained, and this ability to not forget them for a long time is called dhāraṇi of Dharma. 

Finally, the dhāraṇī of meaning simply remembering the Dharma terms of the paths, perfections, and so on.

So, my understanding is that dhāraṇis that come from sutra do not require transmission. Dhāraṇis that come from tantra, may, depending on the level of tantra. It seems that many dhāraṇis that seem to require transmission in the Tibetan tradition do not require transmission in East Asian traditions. 

More research should be done because there are so many dhārṇis that do not have explicit rites of transmissions connected with them.

Ok, I stand corrected, but the presentation here is an explanation of the five kāyas through the four joys. And as such, it is very specific presentation and the usage of these Vedantic terms only occur in one Tantra, the Ḍākārṇava-mahāyoginī-tantra, which has a commentary by Padmavajra.

Śakyamuni Buddha is a nirmanakāya of Samantabhadra. This means that Śakyamuni Buddha woke up without having to follow a path, without any effort and without engaging in any virtue at all.

No one ever said the three kāyas were separable. 

In Dzogchen it is held that from the point of view of the basis, the three kāyas are the dharmakāya; from the point of view of the path, the three kāyas are the sambhogakāya; from the point of view of result, the three kāyas are the nirmanakāya. The three kāyas are always inseparable. 

The reason there is a "difference" between them has to do the fact that ordinary sentient beings and bodhisattvas on the lower stages can see only the nirmanakāya; higher bodhisattvas can see the sambhogakāya; only buddhas can see the dharmakāya. 

In other words, Samantabhadra, the dharmakāya, always has a sambhogakāya and a nirmanakāya Why? For as long as there are deluded sentient beings, the buddhas appear to teach them.

One characteristic of rituals of Bon origin is that at the beginning of the rite there is a narrative of its origin. Look at ChNN's description of Sang on page 109 of Drung, Deu and Bon. 

No one is denying Buddhist appropriation of some native Tibetan rites like Sang, but there is not even one single rite of Sang that was translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan. The Sang offering attributed to Padmasambhava was written in Tibet. Also this Sang offering shows evidence of having been converted from a Bonpo rite because like other Bonpo rites and Sang, it contains a narrative of its origin. 

Offering of incense as a object of scent and Sang, which is used for purification, have totally different functions. In ancient Tibetan culture, nomads would have newcomers to their camp pass through Sang smoke to prevent contagious diseases. They mainly used juniper, but also many other aromatic plants as well. The principle of Sang and the principle of smudging in Native American cultures is very similar.

Sūtras and tantras are not written documents. The written documents that record them are merely a shadow of verbal discourse that took place at some time. The meaning of those documents is not contained within the documents. 

We can certainly come to understand the meaning of the Dharma by studying with a teacher. We can never come to understand the meaning of the Dharma merely by reading books. 

For example, the name of a teaching like Kalacakra, does not mean that the real Kalacakra can be found in the book called Kalacakra. Just as the real Prajñāpāramitā cannot be found in all the books that bear that name. The meaning of Kalackara and Prajñāpāramitā can only be learned from a teacher, never from the books themselves.

You should acquaint yourself with the eight freedoms and ten favorable conditions that constitute a precious human birth, not just any old human birth. 

With respect to having complete sense organs intact, if one does not, for example, it makes one unsuitable to be a Vajrayāna practitioner. 

With respect to studying common Dharma, in ancient times blind people were less at a disadvantage than the deaf. These days the people with sensory deficits are at less of a disadvantage because of modern technology, but I wager there are very few blind people who participate on the forum. 

To answer Dzogchungpa's question, the main criteria is organs of sight and hearing.

To answer Garuda Vista's question, in Dzogchen there are techniques for blind people. 

But in general we have to understand that precious human birth has very precise criteria which indicates the ease with which one may meet and study Dharma.

If one has received direct introduction, it is possible that you may understand something more clearly with such a text, but since direct introduction works with experiences, there is no way one can substitute this conceptual understanding for working with the transmission by means of working with various experiences until one discovers the basis, aka primordial state, for oneself and has stabilizes that knowledge [rig pa]. 

The reason? Direct introduction works with experiences to show what the foundation that lies below experiences, thoughts and concepts, i.e. the mind essence. This is extremely subtle and cannot be discovered merely through reading books, no matter how holy or profound. The error, quite frankly, is mistaking the fact that we are aware with that awareness being the mind essence itself. The awareness that we experience moment to moment is quite coarse, and is dominated by our "energy," our rlung or vāyu. The mind essence is much more subtle than any awareness we can experience. 

Direct introduction, received from a master who knows what it is he is introducing, is indispensable —&nbsp;it sets up the foundation for our later discovery of our own state even if at the time the experience was too subtle for us to register it clearly. Anytime anyone participates in a direct introduction with a realized master in a whole hearted openly collaborative way [rather than passively expecting something to happen], they will in fact experience that moment of knowledge [rig pa] the master intends to introduce. Even if they do not "grasp" it at the time, they will have that experience to carry with them. In the beginning, our concepts are very strong, and our ability to see the mind essence is very weak. Therefore, our moment of rig pa we experience in the direct introduction is something like a small branch caught up in a torrent of a river of concepts — it is very easily swept away. But if we are patient, and we are diligent, we can again have that experience of the mind essence, upon which all future practice depends. Why? Because it was introduced and we had it once. There is nothing at all mystical about the process, it is straightforward and nonmagical. 

The process of reading is too conceptual, the mind involved is too coarse, and therefore, it is impossible that we can experience the mind essence from reading a text. However, if we have experienced the mind essence reading books such as the Chos dbying mdzod and so on can reinforce our confidence which we can bring to our practice. 

In order to experience the mind essence we have to cut through coarse concepts with various methods to re-experience the mind essence that we were exposed to during the introduction. This is why we have practices such as rushen and semszin, and supremely, Song of the Vajra.

Termas are revealed by people who have already studied and practiced and attained realization. They are not revealed by people with no training and no realization.

Because you don't understand Dzogchen, you really can't appreciate what HHDL is saying here. 

1) There is the question of whether it is really proper to try an understand Dzogchen on the basis of sūtra. I personally question the entire context of HHDL's comments. Dzogchen is not part of the three turnings, not at all. 

2) The main controversy HHDL mentions is whether is proper to consider tathāgatagarbha as presented in sūtra to be the same as lhun grub or not. 

This is just not the same thing as conflating Yogacara and Dzogchen. Tathāgatagarbha has a very subordinate role in Yogacara. It is almost entirely ignored.

That's an interesting question. Even if the bliss associated with full awakening is deeper than mere liberation, it is not a great degree of liberation, but rather, a quality associated with the result of the path. 

There are basically five paths and ten stages. Paths measure realizations, stages measure qualities. There are also four kinds of realized persons, which are in fact measures of liberation from latent afflictions. The measure of full liberation is an arhat, pratyekabuddha, or an eighth stage bodhisattva, because only arhats, pratyekabuddhas and eighth stage bodhisattvas on up are free from birth in the three realms. However, the difference between the former two and the latter are the qualities cultivated on the path and the depth of realization. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas do not necessarily realize the emptiness of phenomena, and they do not necessarily comprehend the nonarising of phenomena.

In that respect, just as a rishi possesses the five clairvoyances and a pure eye, in the same way bodhisattvas generate bodhicitta, and after they attain patience for the nonarising of phenomena, it is observed that they attain the full perfect buddhahood of unsurpassed perfect complete awakening.

One who does not attain any phenomena, where is nirvana for one such as he? The Tathāgatas introduce them to awakening, and having generated bodhicitta, they do not abide in samsara and they also do not attain nirvana. 

Son of a good family, a women who possesses four qualities should take this Saddharmapundarika in hand. If it is asked what four, they are as follows: being blessed by the Buddha Bhagavans, having generated roots of virtue, abiding in the heap of certainties and having generated the thought of unsurpassed perfect full awakening in order to protect all sentient beings.

The generation of bodhicitta is a central theme of the Lotus Sūtra.

Just as there is no snake apart from the rope that we see, there also no snake in the rope that we see. So too it is with a self — there is no self apart from the persons and phenomena that we see, there is also no self in the persons and phenomena we perceive. 

If the snake and the rope are the same thing, we should also see a snake when we see a rope. 

Since we do not see a snake when we see a rope, and we do not see rope when we see a snake, we can understand that in fact the former perception is accompanied by knowledge and the latter perception is accompanied by ignorance.  

We can understand that rope and the snake are just not the same thing. If they were the same thing, when one was seen, the other must always be seen. For example, when we fire, it is always accompanied by heat.

Likewise, If the self and the suchness are the same thing, we should also see a self when we see suchness. 

Since we do not see a self when we see suchness, and we do not see suchness when we see a self, we can understand that in fact the former perception is accompanied by knowledge and the latter perception is accompanied by ignorance. 

You make a big deal about purity, permanence and so on. There is no self without the selfless; there is purity without the impure, and so on. Taking these teachings in the Nirvana Sūtra and so on literally just traps one in dualistic categories. This why they cannot be taken literally.

As Vasubandhu states in the Kośabhaṣyam:

Further, if it is asked whether there is liberation apart from this [Dharma] or not, there is not. If it is asked why, because of clinging to the false view of self, [others] do not maintain the definition that the continuum of the aggregates alone is designated as a self, they designate the self on some other substance alone, and therefore the afflictions arise from grasping at a self. 

If it is asked, "How are we to understand that the expression, 'self', is an expression used to engage the continuum of aggregates alone and nothing else?," it is because [a self] cannot be directly perceived nor can it be inferred. If those other phenomena that exist do not hinder it, it should be directly perceptible, in the case of the the six objects and the mind, or other wise inferable, as in the case of the sense organs. 

Consistent with this remark by Vasubandhu we see the Buddha using the term atman to refer to himself, and so on as a mere designation, etc. He never uses it to refer to a real entity, not even in the much vaunted Nirvana Sūtra.

Their meditation deviated into reifying clarity as something real.

The only difference between the latter two traditions is whether there are multiple purushas or one universal purusha. In reality, this purusha is called jñā, the knower, no different than the citta you describe. 

The second account you gave, where everything is included in one eternal citta, is just the sat cit ānanda of Advaita.

Nāgārjuna begins the MMK with this famous verse:

At no time and no where 
does anything arise
from itself, from other, 
from both or without a cause. 


Nāgārjuna's presentation does not dissolve the difference between cause and effect, it states that one cannot coherently designate causes and effects as being either the same or different without the following flaws. 

For example, the Samkhya school maintains that effects are present in their causes, violating Nāgārjuna first maxim, "no arising from itself"; the Vaiśeṣika school maintains that causes and results are utterly distinct, violating Nāgārjuna;s second maxim, "no arising from other." The third maxim, "no arising from both" is present merely for formal completeness —&nbsp;I know of no Indian school that proposes both.

The consequence of the first assertion is that arising is unnecessary and there is can only be homogenous reproduction of the series[ thus proposing that existents arise from existents].  The consequence of the second assertion is that there is arising of an existent result from a cause that has already temporally perished, [thus proposing that existents arise from nonexistents.] The consequence of the third assertion involves the faults of the first two assertions. 

Nāgārjuna, and all subsequent Madhyamikas, maintain conventionally that causes are neither the same nor different form their effects in order to account for causal continuity without invoking either identity or discontinuity, thus Nāgārjuna's fourth maxim, "There is no arising without a cause," is never violated at any time. 

Of course, later, Nāgārjuna shows that ultimately arising is impossible:

An existent does not arise from existent, 
an existent does not arise from a nonexistent, 
an nonexistent does not arise from an existent,
a nonexistent does not arise from a nonexistent —
where then is there arising?

The kind of Chan ChNN is talking about is the kind of Chan that once existed in Tibet and no longer does. It was discussed at length by Nubchen. 

ChNN said that modern Chan/Zen is very influenced by Vajrayāna. There is someone who posts here occasionally, Matilda, who comes from a traditional Soto Temple family. According to her, the senior Soto Priests in Japan preserve a set of empowerments and practices in which they alone engage. It seems that the Soto school has not shared everything of their tradition with westerners so far.

Tīrthika —&nbsp;it is not pejorative. It is a term used in both Buddhadharma and Jain Dharma to describe the head of another school. It has come to mean followers of other schools. It literally means "one who crosses a ford"

The Tibetan translation of the term is mu stegs pa; where mu means extreme, and stegs means upholding, thus it means "one who upholds extremes."

It is an interesting term. If you examine the context of the term, the way it is used in Tibetan, you will swiftly see that "total state of being" does not work well. 

In Dzogchen, the term bdag nyid chen po and bdag nyid accompanies the terms ngang and rang bzhin. This true in both Buddhist and Bon texts. 

For example, in the Zhang Zhung sNyan rGyud, we find:

State [ngang], nature [rang bzhin] and identity [bdag nyid] are a trio.
The state is the total clarity of rig pa. 
The nature is the total emptiness of rig pa. 
The identity is the nonduality of clarity and emptiness.
Everything is understood as pure consummate mind [byang chub sems]
through the axiom of total identity [bdag nyid chen po].


I have many similar examples from Buddhist texts. So here, I would prefer to render this term as "total identity."

As I said, Dudjom, Kongtrul and I do not disagree. We understand these texts. But you do not, and so you are perpetually confused as to what they mean because you just read the words without understanding the meaning and so you imagine contradictions where in fact none exist. 

And you keep on attributing a dimension of time to a state where there is no time. Dzogchen texts talk about the fourth time. That is the time of the basis, i.e. no past, present, future. Hence use of the terms like original, primordial, and so on. The basis is one's own unfabricated mind —— it is not a buddha, it is not a sentient being, it is beyond time, beyond extremes, beyond expression, it has never been liberated because it has never experienced a state of bondage and so on. Accumulating merit and wisdom will not liberate it; engaging in the five heinous misdeeds [harming a buddha, killing an arhat, etc.] will not place it in bondage. There is nothing you can to improve it, nothing you can do will harm it. It is empty, clear and inseparable. Relatively, when it is not recognized, it is called "the basis appears as the universe." At the time it is recognized, it is called "The universe arises as the basis." The basis is the basis, it is the path and it is the result. There is no buddhahood to find outside of the basis, likewise, there is no buddhahood to find outside of one's own unfabricated mind. One'w unfabricated mind is buddhahood. There is no other buddhahood to realize. Everything is complete within that unfabricated mind, all of samsara and nirvana is complete there. And there are also no phenomena of either samsara or nirvana at all present in the basis. 



So obviously Kongtrul has a different take on it. You may disagree, as is your right, but if you push it you're basically calling him a tirthika.[/quote]

The difference is that the basis is not "a basis or ground of being" since being, nonbeing, etc. are not established even slightly from the very start within the basis itself. The being of the basis is not established, so how can it form a basis for beings? 

It does not. In fact, all of this display of samsara and nirvana arise because the basis is not recognized for what it actually is. But there is not even the slightly iota of phenomena within the basis itself. 

Anyway, the basis is just a word for one's own unfabricated mind. The generic basis is just a description of that unfabricated mind's characteristics, i.e. emptiness, clarity and their inseparability.

No, SMCJ, the term in Tibetan is simple gzhi, basis. There is no connotation of being presented by use of the term gzhi. In fact the gzhi, the basis is devoid of any extreme of existence, nonexistence and so on. The basis is ka dag, originally pure, i.e. empty, as Master Vimalamitra states:

The basis, the state of initial original purity, is liberated
because its essence is not established at all.

"Ground of being" is a term coined by the theologian Paul Tillich to describe God. The basis is not a creative force like God. It does not generate anything. Nothing arises from the basis, and nothing returns to the basis. The Six Dimension offers some clarity:

Dharmatā free from proliferation is originally pure;
it is the basis of an intrinsically pure nature;
it is free from words and syllables;
it cannot be confirmed through expression;
it is free from all conventional reification;
it is without concepts of apprehended objects and apprehending
subjects;
it is without buddhas and without sentient beings;
it is without phenomena and without perception of phenomena;
no one, no thing, nothing at all.
When the essence of such nonexistence
is confirmed with some words:
the essence is original purity
and the nature is natural perfection.

Therefore, because awakening and non-awakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.
In accordance with the meaning of that, all those explanations 
of the nominal ultimate, the absence of arising and ceasing, sameness, 
nonduality, beyond thought, emptiness, the dharmadhātu, 
freedom from expression and convention, and so on are not ultimate and also are not relative.
If it is said, “This is the path in accordance with the ultimate,” that is relative.

The Madhyamaka point of view is that causes and effects are neither the same nor are they different, thus avoiding all contradictions between absence of identity and continuity.

You are countering an argument I have not made.

The 47the chapter of the All-Creating King Tantra states:

Because the Great Perfection has always been beyond cause and result,
there is nothing to do and nothing to accomplish with seeking and practicing.
Having set the scriptures taught by the teachers of the view of cause [sentient beings] and result [buddhas]
as standards for the phenomena of worldly characteristics,
a result to accomplished is sought from a cause. 
Without a cause in the mind there has never been a result
because there is no arising in awakened mind [bodhicitta]. 
Having used an example for worldly arising phenomena, 
perishing after arising cannot be termed production.
Since the self-originated beyond cause and result cannot be examined,
having set the standard for the phenomena of worldly characteristics,
it claimed that a result is produced that is sought from a cause,
that is the provisional scripture of the vehicles of cause and result.

I imagine, though I could not tell you for sure, that is is three sections divided by five sections. It has the usual subjects like confidence in the guru, bodhicitta, refuge and confession, mandala, supplication to the guru, etc. 

So I imagine that first retreat focuses mainly on Ngondro, the second and third retreats focus mainly nature of mind, etc.

This illustration, from left to right, shows mountains according to elemental typology: wood [ཤིང], fire [མེ], metal [ལྕགས] and water [ཆུ]. 

It is generally held that the science of sa dbyad comes from China. The above illustration is from a text from is called The Treasury of Jewels, Chinese Site Analysis [rgya nag dpyad nor bu'i gter mdzod]. There are also site examination texts from India, having to do with mandala construction, as well as the subject of Vastu śastra. 

The dual influences of Chinese and Indian culture on these issues is demonstrated by Karma Chagme's short text on this subject. We can see here too Tibetan pre-Buddhist ideas about ancestors and so on in the way the term bla is used in this specific context. The first chapter of Karma Chagme's text states:

The accurate result of the relative site:
in general, all of the outer universe and inhabitants
have the nature of the five elements. 
India, China, Mongolia and Tibet
are based on the way earth element has formed. 

The chronicle of happiness, suffering, 
increase and decrease, wealth and poverty
is clarified in the site examination texts of Kīlaya. 
Therefore, this location of the living, 
such as location of the house and so on, is important. 

Life [srog], the soul [bla] and consciousness [rnam shes] are a trio. 
Life is taken by the ghostly butcher.
Consciousness is the slave of karma.
Having taken the form of the past life, the soul
exists in the tomb site.  
If the tomb site is good, that soul prospers,
will protect and guard the living,
and is called "being guarded by the souls of the paternal ancestors."
If the tomb site is bad, that soul flounders,
and since it seeks protection in the living, 
the misfortune of unbearable illnesses arise. 
Therefore, the site of the tomb is important. 
It was said by Ārya Mañjusȓī
in the Tantras of the Divinatory Sciences of China,
"If the corpse is carried to a badly analyzed site,
even animals will be crushed into dust."

The text continues in the following chapter by listing various titles of Chinese and India site examination texts. Chapter three gives the general technique. Chapter four gives the techniques for picking a tomb site. Chapter five gives the specifics for picking a house site. Chapter six gives the specifics for selecting a site for practicing Chod. 

FYI, the above text is a section of Karma Chagme's Mountain Dharma.

Much of this information about directions, shapes of the land and so on is to be found in elemental calculation, which is also part of the "Divinatory Sciences of China."
