IN general, Gorampa and Rongton more or less have the same view. Many of Gorampa's refutations were penned defenses of Rongton against Khedrup. 

Gorampa found Rendawa a bit extreme in terms of Rendawa's polemics againt Jonang, but again, there is no real difference view. 

As for Maitreya treatises Gorampa considers Abhisamayalamkara and Uttaratantra definitive, depending oninterpretation, and the other three provisional. 

Gorampa's works are considered the gold standard for view in Sakya, apart from the five founders.

It is a contention found in the collected works of the Sakya master, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen. There he states that according to his own Kagyu teacher, Milarepa never mentioned that Marpa directly encountered Naropa. 

This is further confirmed by the fact that when Marpa met Atisha, Atisha informed Marpa that Naropa had already passed. 

If Marpa did meet Naropa, it is likely he did so in a visionary encounter, similar to the encounter of Sachen Kunga Nyingpo with the Mahāsiddha Virupa in Tibet.

Which clearly developed in Tibet during the later ninth and early tenth century and is irrelevant to any Vajrayāna developments in India. Even the term "rainbow body" does not make a clear appearance in any Tibetan literature that can be dated prior the 11th century. 

It is a grievous error to assume that by "Mahāyoga", any of the tantras which were unknown to Tibetans prior to the 11th century are being referred to. 

If later Nyingma authors refer to the so called anuttarayoga tantras translated in the gsar ma period as being equivalent with the so called "Mahāyoga" presented in the nine yāna scheme, they are being extremely anachronistic.

First, this discussion was created by Greg, and not me. I was replying to question about Dharmapālas, and tangentially added my opinion about recorded empowerments, because of course, to practice Dharmapālas one must be someone who possesses samaya and that only comes from a properly granted empowerment. 

I am sorry you felt I was being condescending, but I can assure that I was not.I was being factual. 

Replying is pointless because:

1. It is not my job to condition you or your beliefs, despite the fact that I have every right to express my opinion. 

2. This is not the correct venue to discuss the details of empowerments, how they work and why transmission through a recorded medium is invalid because it involves the discussion of many details of empowerments, how samaya vows are imparted and received, etc., which are not suitable for discussion in a public forum. 

3. In the end, you will not accept whatever citations and reasonings I produce to demonstrate that such a system is poorly conceived because you have already declared it is valid. 

Therefore, apart from expressing my reservations about the matter I have really nothing further to say on the subject.

If you do not have samaya, then there is no need for a Dharma protector since Dharma protectors, in principle, are restricted to highest yoga tantra. 

That said, in general we can consider the four directional guardians and so on as "protectors" in the Sūtra system since they will automatically protect those who uphold the Dharma of any of the three vehicles. 

Otherwise, Mahakāla, etc., only protect those who have samaya from empowerments.

There is little point. Suffice it say that a properly granted empowerment concerns the arrangement of profound dependent origination. That cannot occur if the student is not physically present with the teacher in the same room at the same time in some way. 

Next, we will have people becoming Buddhist monks on the basis of recorded ordinations. 

Hopefully, people who attend such recorded empowerments will make effort to see Garchen Rinpoche in person at a later time. Otherwise, I think there is absolutely no blessing, and in fact, I think there are real problems created in terms of samaya.

This was a two day major empowerment. Therefore, it requires no previous empowerment, it is self contained. 

In general, there were three traditions that came through Naropa to Sakya: Luipa, Krishnapa and Ghantapada's Cakrasamvara traditions. Therefore, it is considered that one should have received one, two or all three of these empowerments as a prerequisite for Naro Khachod, because the completion stage practice of Naro Khacho combines all three traditions into the their essentials, in addition its own special features. 

However, the Vajrayogini Empowerment comes from Mahasiddha Virupa, and what is not widely known is that his main deity for 24 years was actually Vajrayogini.

The Bhutanese were fair, as far as I am concerned. The Nepali Communists wanted to take over Nepal, and used the presence of the Lhotsampas as a pretext for agitation. The whole situation is far more complicated than you paint it. And in the end, the Bhutanese Gvt. has the right to secure their borders and expel those they deem illegal. Not all Lhotsampas were expelled, incidentally. The real crime is the way the Nepalese Communists have abandoned their own countrymen in camps in Eastern Nepal.

This is not true; an Bhavaviveka (if not Candrakirti) specifically allows that conventionally speaking, it is vijñāna that takes rebirth.  Moreover, when the we look at the chain of dependent origination analyzed by such texts as the Vibhanga, they clearly are discussing a stream of mental events when rebirth is cast over three lifetimes. 

Then of course there is the old "when vijñāna descends into the womb..." in the Mahāniddana sutra.

This is the problem with your view: you see reality as a container in which are contained cognitions and things. This is an inherently dualistic view; it is also essentialist. 

In fact, there is no reality at all, apart from the reality that is constructed by minds acting together. The great Dzogchen master Shabkar reports in canto 11 of his famed Flight of the Garuda:

When a devaputra asked the Buddha:
“Who made Meru, the sun and the moon, and so on?”
The Buddha said:
“There is no other creator here.
The attachment of the traces of one’s conceptuality
imputes them, grasps them and then they appear in that way.
Everything is created by one’s mind.”
When the devaputra asked the Buddha again:
“How can the attachment of my concepts
make the hardness and stability of
Meru, the sun and moon, and so on?”
The Buddha said:
“In Varanasi, an old woman
meditated her own body as a tiger.
Since the villagers saw her
as a tiger, they evacuated the village.
If one is able to appear like that for a little while,
if one cultivates mental traces for beginningless lifetimes,
one will be able to appear like this for a year.”
Therefore, everything is created by the mind...
therefore, whatever is imputed by the concepts of the mind
can be perceived by others.

"The variety of the world is due to action"
-- Vasubandhu. 

If you are a realist dualist Buddhist, i.e. you belong to one of the two lower tenet systems (and your views are very much in line with those apart from the fact that you reject rebirth, and thus in reality you are a Carvaka in your view), the differentiation in the world that you observe comes about because of the actions of intelligent creatures acting in the world. 

The universe was formed by the multitude of consciousnessess in the following manner —&nbsp;to put it in more modern terms, it is the affliction in the consciousness of sentient beings that caused the instability in the proposed singularity at the observable beginning of this universe. 

Until physics can model the general role of consciousness in the formation of the universe mathematically, its explanation of cosmology will always be incomplete and there will always be unanswered questions.

It is a convention used to describe the aggregate of similar karmas belonging to individual beings. It is only in this sense that the term "collective" is used. It does not mean there is a collective consciousness, because of course, there is not.

Of course, when people do not take the time to study the fundamentals of Buddhadharma as presented in Abhidharma and so on, it is very likely they will misunderstand terms like "collective karma" to refer to karma generated by a collective consciousness.

When the previous universe is destroyed, it is destroyed only up to the level of the third form realm. All remaining sentient beings exist in the upper highest form realm (those who are not in the formless realm, that is). Eventually, as their merit is exhausted, the winds created by their traces of karma generate an air mandala which begins the formation of a new container universe. As sentient beings have karma to be reborn in this and that place, this or that place appears to receive them.

For example, when beings no longer have karma to be reborn in the hell realms, the hell realms vanish. 

This is all very clearly explained in such texts as Abhidharmakosha. Even if you take a Mahāyāna perspective, which does not accept that phenomena actually exist apart from the mind, nevertheless, it is very clearly explained in such texts as the Mahāyānasamgraha that the container universe exists because of the seeds which exist in the ālayavijñānas of sentient beings, thus all hell beings are experiencing the ripening of seeds for the hell realms in their ālayavijñānas together. 

The variety of the world is created by karma.

Yes, but you have to understand what "space" means in Buddhist terms; in this case in refers to absence of obstruction. So space arises from consciousness, just as consciousness itself arises from luminosity [od gsal]. 

For example, I demonstrated to you before that the five "empty" atoms (meaning very subtle, i.e., the tanmatras actually) in Kalacakra arise from the karmic winds which are produced by consciousness; these then form the basis for the coarse particles and so on. The universe and the elements within it arise from the collective actions of all sentient beings. This is a principle that is very well established from Abhidharma up to Dzogchen. 

It is never that case in Dharma that any one thing is produced from a single cause; all conditioned things are produced from causes and conditions conventionally speaking. When it is asserted in a Buddhist context that matter arises from mind it does not mean that one mind produces all matter; it means that all matter is produced by all minds.

This sort of treatment is the post-modern version of "rebirth". It is not what the Buddha taught, however. In reality, the Buddha taught that one's five aggregates continue into the next world. It is foolish to deny that this is what the Buddha taught. You may not accept it, you may think it is nonsense, but if so, you are not really a student of the Buddha. It bears repeating that Buddha taught four kinds of liberated persons in terms of how many rebirths and in what realm (desire realm or form realm) it would take them to achieve final nirvana. Dzogchen tantras especially spend a great deal of time discussing rebirth and the bardo, and they do not mean this symbolically. To discard rebirth then is to discard the whole of the Buddha's Dharma and to replace it with some post-modern intellectualism as you have done here.

Basically, I find it unlikely that Indians all of a sudden adopted writing merely because of tenuous contacts with the Greeks. What I am suggesting as a more likely scenario is that Indians used writing for commercial documents, not religious texts, during this period. We have no paper documents at all from the Subcontinent that date earlier than Gandharan finds.

Personally, I am not that invested in the issue. I simply find it a little far-fetched to believe that Indians widely adopted a writing system based on a Phoenician script within the 150 year time frame. 

Secondly, Indians had concepts of debt and contracts, found in the Vedas on up. Buddha, for example, clearly refers to karma has a kind of a debt. Where there are debts, there must be means of keeping records of such debts, etc.

The fact that Vinaya was composed in layers was known a long time before Schopen. Anyone who has studied the three vows literature is already well acquainted with this fact. Read Gorampa (for one) and educate yourself.

According to Schopen, there are no "earliest" records. As you know, he basically does not think anything is reliably datable based on text criticism alone. 

Megasthenes had very limited contact with Indian culture and civilization. 

We can say with certainty that Ashoka used writing. We cannot say with certainty when writing first was used in India and by whom. All we can really say with certainty is that it, like most other scripts in the ancient world, was based on Western Semitic, where aleph = an Ox.

It is quite likely that some form of writing existed in India during the time of Buddha. It may not have been used to record religious texts, but considering your recent speculations about a Mesopotamian/India connection, it would be absurd to suppose that Indians kept all their financial undertakings in their heads. And given that bark records don't survive long in India...

In general, in Indian Buddhism, female birth is considered a disadvantage. A term often seen in sutras is "skye dman", inferior birth, used frequently for women. It is based on a Sanskrit original, but I forget what it is, something like hinajati.

It does not mean that women cannot achieve awakening, it means however they have some obstacles men do not have.

No, it is a practical observation. Women have more illnesses, they endure the hardship of childbirth, menstruation, etc. It is for this reason that there are many sutras where women are encouraged to desire rebirth as men in their next life. 

On the other hand, as you note, in all highest yoga tantra traditions, the negative view of female birth is reversed because all women have the nature of prajñā. This is not an especially "Nyingma" perspective.

First, I don't recall the model you described. This thread is complicated and our discussion has long since departed from the main body of the thread. 

In the Madhyamaka model, the two truths are merely cognitions (veridical or false) of one and the same object.

Well, the way Candrakirti defines the two truths is a little more precise: he states that the two truths are the object of either true or false cognitions respectively. In this case then, luminosity would be an ultimate truth. However, when luminosity is not correctly perceived, it becomes a relative truth; when it is correctly perceived, it is an ultimate truth. 

The point however is that the truths are defined on the basis of veridical or false cognitions, so as a shorthand, I place the emphasis on the cognitions since they are the defining factor. 

So yes, the two truths are conventionally subjective, they are not objective. The object of a veridical cognition, dharmatā śunyatā, is the ultimate truth. Nevertheless, the realization of ultimately truth comes when one's mind is truly synchronized with how things are (yatha bhutaṃ) and the apparent duality of subject and object vanishes since it is not there to begin with. 

While one is confined to relative truth cognitions (including relative formulations of ultimate truths) one is necessarily confined to subject/object duality. There is no conceivable way to avoid this as long as we are using words and concepts.

By definition an unconscious being has no cognitions. 

Second, luminosity is the object of the mind of the black near attainment. 

When there is no subject object duality, then according to the Yogacara school there are no further cognitions of things like rocks and trees, which are understood to be mind only. That absence of subject/object duality aka mind only,  is understood by them to be ultimate truth. The appearances of rocks and trees are understood to be relative. 

For Madhyamaka the cognition of subject and object is considered relative, when it is understood and realized that all phenomena are empty, that correct cognition is termed ultimate truth and subject and object cognition ceases. 

So, your conclusion is not valid, and misses the barn by a wide mark.

No. 

Things [mental appearances] appear because of karmic traces; karmic traces occur because of afflicted minds, afflicted minds also arise because of karma traces. Minds are both cause and results; traces are both causes and results. 

Since Buddhadarma rejects origins, the fault you should be seeking is infinite regress, not circularity, but in this case, there is no problem since mind has not discernible origin. There is not absolute beginning to the process of mind, affliction, traces, ripening of traces (appearances) and so on.

The doctrine you should be examining is called citta saṃtana parināma, i.e., transformations of the stream of cittas.

In Samkhya, the 24 tattvas, beginning with mulaprakṛiti, are insentient. Only purusha is sentient. Buddhi, ahamkara and mamas are actually inert, not sentient, They seem to be aware but they are not aware — in actuality, they merely reflect the light of consciousness (jñā, purusha). This is why in Saṃkhya/yoga one tries to balance three gunas, so that sattva becomes predominate, and then from there one realizes the even buddhi is not the self and then purusha finally rests in itself. 

But this is a very different system than Buddhadharma.

NO, that vow is not a guarantee of rebirth in Sukhavati. It merely guarantees a vision. 

Secondly, your Nirvana sutra citation does not describe the career of a female buddha. It merely describes the ability of a buddha to manifest a buddha in female form. 

The fact remains that the only place where embodied female buddhahood, i.e. that one can attain buddhahood without changing from a female gender, is expressed only in Vajrayāna. It is just a fact of text, it is not even controversial. 

The idea that there is no gender in the Sukhavati pure land is a post-modern interpretation.

In all Sanskrit literature referring to Avalokiteśvara, Avalokiteśvara is strictly referred to as male. It is only in China that Avalokiteśvara's gender is bent. 

As to gender ambiguity in bodhisattvas, there are some examples of this, Śariputra's encounter with the goddess of the ganges, for example. But Amitabha is indeed male as are all who are born in his pure land.

And as I stated, specifically, in my neck of the woods, his kind are extremely rare. Most of the Republicans in MA live in and around Central MA and in Berkshire County. Eastern MA and Western MA (meaning Franklin, Hampshire and Hamden Counties) are about as liberal as you get anywhere in the country.

Well, the best thing one can do is continue to support civil rights for all people. The recognition of civil rights is not an overnight process, and it is a process. The way it has worked in the US is that first propertied white men secured their full civil rights, then men in general, then in a limited way, blacks; then women, then there was the civil rights movement, based on that the feminist movement, based on that the gay rights movement, now gay marriage. 

In reality, the history of the expansion of civil rights is not bleak, it is in fact encouraging. But one lesson we can learn, is that when one group secures recognition for its civil rights, there is often another group that has been ignored or not seen in the back ground.

I am pretty sure Hayek had a very good grasp of both, since he was Austrian, and fled Europe in 1933. 

His principle observation is that both right and left wing collectivism share a common belief, i.e., that economies should be centrally planned. This is the main thrust of his thinking. In general, he was not nearly as libertarian as librarians read him. He fully supported the idea that laws can and should be passed to limit markets and so on. Further, another of his main observations is that Democracies only functioned well when people confined themselves to broad issues upon which consensus could be reached through discussion, and tended to break down when they tried to adjudicate specific economic problems which required the creation of a centralized bureaucracies to implement (as all implementations of economic planning require). His third main point about planned economies is that they were a priori goalless, that they required special knowledge of which no one could possibly have.

In the middle swath of the country there is a bit of a ambivalence i.e. Pennsylvania and the Midwest.

Well, these social expectations and so on are a result of more than a thousand years of western history; lately informed by religious doctrines about what is morally normative. We have largely dropped the notion that who you want to f^%k has any moral implications, unless it is children and animals. 

As far as racism goes, the problem is not that white is normative, the problem is when privileged people impose norms on those who are not privileged, thus denying them opportunities. Racism means "You are X, this is the norm you are expected to conform to", It does not mean, "I am Y, this is the norm you should aspire too but can never attain because you are X." If you are X in a racist society, you are never supposed to aspire to Yness.

It is because the early literature of so-called klong sde makes no reference in general to such topics which were really only introduced to Tibet during the new translation period. So with the Vajra Bridge histories, we begin to see the evolution of what would swiftly turn into "man ngag sde". Aslo, I see to reason to doubt the account presented in the Vajra bridge histories and the so called early sems sde histories since they agree on virtually every point about the career of Vairocana and the introduction of Dzogchen to Tibet. The first place we see any real departure from the historical accounts presented in these earlier accounts is with Zhanton's text, which completely reframes the career of Sṛī  Simha and places the arrival of Vimalamitra during the reign Trisong Desten, whereas the earlier histories place Vimala's arrival during the reign of Ralpacan. 

I personally think that Zhangton's account was intended compete with the marvelous tales of Indian siddhas like Naropa and so on. There was no such need for such narrative largess in the pre "gsar ma" period. One key clue is the appropriation of the iconography of Virupa for Śrī Simha.

"Normative" does not imply a value judgement, viz good/bad, etc. It just means, "what is most common". Basically ten percent of the population has a same sex gender orientation, this runs across social class, different societies, etc. This is just how things are. You can make the observation that there is normative ten percent variation in gender preference if you like. 

You can parse these things in all kinds of ways. The fact remains that most people's gender orientation is towards the opposite gender. We are embodied mammals and while of course gender orientation has karmic causes, when we are embodied, we tend to express our gender orientations based on the facts of our embodiment. 

With the rise of western relationship patterns that do not follow western traditional norms, a variety of civil right issues have arisen that otherwise would not have. 

Even so, From a Buddhist pov, everyone is born with a single gender, which cannot be changed despite their sexuality, no matter how fabulous they are.

This is an understandable misconception. 

In the Sakya tradition there are, in general, no non-celibate clergy apart from the Khon family members. In fact, HHST wanted to become a monk, but because of his birth heritage that option was not available to him. In general, most Khon family males who were not in line to be the throne holder of Sakya usually become monks. In this case, the younger son of His Holiness, Jñānavajra, was a monk for many years. He chose to give up his vows for his own reasons, but it was not without some controversy. 

While the Khon family has been the locus for secular power from the beginning of the founding of the tradition, it has only been the spiritual locus of the tradition occasionally, with the real spiritual authority of Sakya resting primarily with the Ngor Khenpos, and the heads of the Tshar school. Occasionally (and apart from the five founding masters) remarkable figures like Lama Dampa, Kunga Tashi, Amyezhabs, Kunga Lodo, Dagchen Trinly Rinchen and so on have emerged from the Khon family to become major lineage figures, but in general, the Khon family has primarily had a political role in the Sakya school as the secular rulers of the Sakya principality. 

It is really only in the Nyingma school that there is a notion that mantrikas are on a par with bhikṣus. But even in Nyingma, mantrikas are still seated behind the bhikṣus. 

I should also add that even where a lay person is a guru giving initiations, it is permissible, for the purpose of decorum, for monks to prostrate to the shrine rather than the person of the guru if he or she is a lay person. This is fully laid out in 50 verses of Guru Devotion attributed to Ashvaghosha.

Since there are no records of Shri Simha outside of the religious records that exist, then relevant materials are only religious records. 

All of the other things you mentioned about the identity of Li, etc., they have very little to do with the person known as Shri Simha. 

For example, there is no archaeological record of a Shri Simha, and what we know of the fellow is restricted to colophons in texts of uncertain date. 

When confronted with two separate Dzogchen lineage accounts which sites Shri Simha in India, and a third, later tradition, that sites him in an uncertain "rgya nag", well, chances are the two earlier traditions (pan grub thugs bcud and the rod rje zam pa lineage accounts) are the more correct.  

The best we can do is try and understand why Zhangton Tashi Dorje wanted to shift the location of Shri Simha from India to regions outside of India, because it is a certainty that he is the first author to do so.

The problem with wealth redistribution is that it is not feasible. There is no way to ensure fair and equitable distribution because central planning and democracy cannot coexist:

It is the price of democracy that the possibilities of conscious control are restricted to the fields where true agreement exists and that in some fields things must be left to chance. But in a society which for its functioning depends on central planning this control cannot be made dependent on a majority’s being able to agree; it will often be necessary that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people, because this minority will be the largest group able to agree among themselves on the question at issue. Democratic government has worked successfully where, and so long as, the functions of government were, by a widely accepted creed, restricted to fields where agreement among a majority could be achieved by free discussion; and it is the great merit of the liberal creed that it reduced the range of subjects on which agreement was necessary to one on which it was likely to exist in a society of free men. It is now often said that democracy will not tolerate “capitalism.” If “capitalism” means here a competitive system based on free disposal over private property, it is far more important to realize that only within this system is democracy possible. When it becomes dominated by a collectivist creed, democracy will inevitably destroy itself.

I an not using rhetorical tricks. I am merely pointing out that the view you present is based on a one-lifetime model. I would also like to point out again that you are misusing the notion of interdependence. You are mistaking karana-hetu (the fact that all things are causes of all other things apart from themselves) with pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination, which fundamentally describes how sentient beings are caught in samsara and how they can interrupt that process) and the principles of karmavipaka (which describe the effects of morally determined actions). 

When one confuses these three principles— cause and condition, dependent origination and karmavipaka — then one will be very confused about rebirth, karma, status in the world, etc. 

When it comes to conventional reality, there is a statement by Shantideva, "the ultimate of the lower system is the conventional of the higher". Conventional truths are not written in stone. They change, they change depending on what one's understanding is. For example, the conventional truth of a ruler is that he is the most powerful person, but from the conventional truth viewpoint of a persona following Madhyamaka teaching, rulers are the greatest fools of all with the least power. 

From the worldly point of view of the equal rights amendment and so on, we need to enable parity and opportunity for all US citizens, and beyond. I not only accept this, but I support it -- which is why you will have noted on other threads I consider gay marriage to be a civil rights issue and I think that people who don't agree with me have a fundamental lack of understanding of what civil rights means (which is why I think poc who do not support gay marriage have a huge blind spot). I am a deep ecologist, and feel that we have a fundamental obligation to respect all life. While my Buddhist practice informs these perspectives, I do not confuse them with my Buddhist practice. I know quite  well that people who are suffering oppression in this life (for example Tibetans in Tibet) are experiencing the ripening of their own karma. Do I support measures to lessen it where possible? Of course. In other words, while it is true that I regard things like having a hot poker shoved in my eye as a result of karma, I also support the idea that the poker ought to be removed as soon as possible, and the inserting of pokers in eyes should be prevented at all costs. But when it does happen, I am not blind to the fact that all sensations in samsara, be they pleasant or painful, are fundamentally a result of karma. 

A Buddhist social consciousness must be able to accommodate both perspective simultaneously: on the one hand observing that things like attack dogs and water canons being used on non-violent protestors is fundamentally wrong, and understanding also that the people who are being attacked are also experiencing the ripening of their own karma, while the attackers are creating negative karma for themselves too, which will ripen as suffering later. The Buddhist approach to social justice issues therefore should be equanimous concern and effective engagement, rather than passionate involvement and karmically questionable actions.

Where does the Buddha ever say in any śravaka text that nirvana is a self? No where, that's where. 

While indeed the five aggregates are not self, this does not mean that space and the two cessations are a self. 

 Ārya-tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Guhyapati, in the same way, the tathāgatas have summarized all Dharmas. The summaries of Dharmas are defined as four. If it is asked what four: in order to conquer the śramanas and brahmins who advocate permanence, the long-lived gods who think of permanence, it is said "All conditioned things are impermanent. In order to conquer humans and gods who think of happiness, it is said "all conditioned things are suffering". In order to conquer the tīrthikas who propose a permanent self, it is said that all phenomena (dharmas) are without self. In order to subdue that proud who engage in conceptuality, it is said that "nirvana is peace".

Guhyapati, impermanent denotes very impermanent. Suffering denotes freedom from aspiration. Selfless denotes the characteristic of emptiness. "Nirvana is peace" denotes actualizing the absence of characteristics.

Here, we can see what the four seals are really intended for. Further, the Ārya-ratnacūḍaparipṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

"All conditioned things are impermanent", "all conditioned things are suffering", "all phenomena are not self" and "nirvana is peace" are equivalent statements.

Nirvana is the supreme bliss of peace,

The basis represents the potentiality of each sentient being. That potentiality can be parsed a number of ways — for example, in Dzogchen texts it says "At the time of the basis, the three kāyas are dharmakāya; at the time of the path, the three kāyas are the sambhogakāya, and the time of the result, the three kāyas are the nirmanakāya". The essential point here is that the the continuum of the basis is the nature of the mind free from extremes.

Title: Re: The basis is one's unfabricated mind

As I pointed, all of this language concerning "the basis" comes from a passage in the Guhyasamaja uttaratantra. The continuum of the basis, since this is the reference, refers to the nature of the mind, which when recognized leads to buddhahood and when not, leads to samsara. 

People get so hung up on the use of the word mind, consciousness and so on. Well, just look at these words: shes pa (jñā), rnam shes (vijñāna), shes rab (prajñā) and ye shes (jñāna). What do they all have in common? "shes". "Shes" just means "to know". If you say the basis is ye shes, that wisdom is a knower.

In any case, the commentary of the sgra thal 'gyur clearly maintains that ye shes is encompassed by a shes pa, and that shes pa exists individually in all buddhas and sentient beings as a mere knower (shes tsam). 

We can concluded from this then that the basis (which really is strictly a man ngag sde term) is just a name for the continuum of the nature of the mind. 

The extent to which it is unconditioned is the extent to which no one made the mind "clear and empty", the mind has been clear and empty from the very start. Thus the resting in the unfabricated mind, the unconditioned mind, is resting in that nature of the mind (inseparable clarity and emptiness) which cannot be altered or modified in anyway at all no matter what appears in it/to it(hence the mirror metaphor). You can't make it better, you can't make it worse. 

We say that the nature of the mind in this sense is unconditioned because no one made it, it does not have a beginning, it cannot be altered or changed. You cannot take the clarity of the mind and make it unclear. You cannot take the emptiness of the mind and make the mind substantial. 

The mind can have various experiences, suffering, happiness, affliction, purification, thus we can also say that the mind is conditioned. It is also momentary, its continuity is not substantial, it is a continuum of moments, thus it is conditioned. 

Once again, we have a conditioned entity, dharmin, the mind, that has an unconditioned nature, dharmatā, the inseparability of clarity and emptiness. 

The mind is not merely clear, for then it would be only conditioned. It is not merely empty, since then it would be non-existent. The unconditioned nature of the mind is the inseparability of clarity and emptiness. There is no teaching in Buddhism about the mind and the nature of the mind that goes beyond this. 

When we understand the principles above, we understand the union of the two truths, we understand the continuum of the basis, Dzogchen, etc. 

When it comes to Dzogchen teachings, it is crucial to understand that the differences between wisdom, shes pa and rnam shes, for example, are all based on the anatomy of the human body, and the modalities of our consciousness as embodied beings. 

If we say that wisdom, for example, is beyond mind, does that mean that wisdom is inert, like a rock or a statue? No, it just means that wisdom transcends the operations of the restricted consciousness of ordinary beings, wisdom is a consciousness that has less restrictions. What is the basis for the freedom of wisdom? The pure clarity and emptiness of the mind, of course. 

We do not have a refined vocabulary in English for discussing consciousness and its different modalities. But indeed, that is what Dzogchen as well Buddhist texts in general are talking about, i.e., consciousness and its various modalities, unawakened and awakened.

The difference is that your take is realist because it involves "existence" (bhāva, sat, asti, etc.). 

Nagarjuna's take is based on the idea that something supports something else, not that something is permanent. The śravaka schools conceived of things that existed and were also impermanent. They too had an idea of dependent existence. That idea is precisely the idea that Nāgārjuna is criticizing both in the first chapter as well as the chapter 15 of the MMK. There is a vast difference between saying "productions from conditions", which is merely a convention, and "dependent existence" which requires inherency.

Of course not. This is why, for example, before even embarking on the creation stage, one meditates the on the view in Lamdre. 

The purpose of the creation stage to recognize that all phenomena are nothing other than the wisdom of buddhahood.

If you respond this is the view of tregchö, the reason thögal critizes tregchö is that with tregchö one remains in a state of impure vision. With tregchö and other kinds of Dzogchen practice this view, "all phenomena are nothing other than the wisdom of buddhahood", remains a conceptual view.

You can remove all the limbs of a body, but you will never cut the mind. You can cut the brain stem, but brains are not sentient. When you cut the brain stem, the heart stops, the body dies and the stream of consciousness appropriates a new body.

I have spoken about this with ChNN pesonally. One day we were discussing the text of the Kalacakra tantra. He stopped us abruptly to emphasize the point that the text of the tantra was not the tantra itself. The tantra itself was the Kalacakra mandala experienced by a Mahāsiddha. The text was something relative, composed by a person, subject to editing, emendation and so on, a text written about the method of realizing that mandala. 

I never said there were no Tibetan mahāsiddhas. There were and are. This is why I continue believe in the effectiveness of man ngag sde teachings even if I don't really accept their traditional origin story anymore. 

The problem really arises because Tibetans who produced these texts in the 11th century had to cater to the socio-political pressure  of sourcing their teaching outside of Tibet with a foreign teacher— this is true of Nyingma and this is true of Bon. The Nyingma and Bonpo strategy was the treasure tradition and tales of lost Sanskrit and Zhang Zhung originals (which were true in some instances, like Guhyagarbha). The reason this socio-political pressure existed was that new texts were being brought from India, and i the 11th century and beyond, if you could not prove your text was Indian, it was regarded as spurious. Now, there are all sorts of linguistic reasons (which I do not have space to detail here) that we cannot accept that the seventeen tantras are translations from even one language into Tibetan (let alone three in the case of the Rig pa rang shar, which claims it was translate from Oddiyanese, Sanskrit and Chinese!!!). 

Nevertheless, while we can understand the historical provenance of the 17 tantras as texts to be a fabrication, we do not have to doubt their spiritual provenance since they are a record of the spiritual experience of a number of yogically advanced scholar practitioners in the 11th century who were riffing of older material from the 8th, 9th and 10th century as well as newer innovations by Indian yogis that was being imported in the eleventh century. Thus their lineage is intact in the live experimentation of yogis, just not in the fairy tale style it is communicated to children and naive people. 

For example, Mahasiddha Virupa, a magical terrorist of great power, supposedly stops the sun in India. I love Virupa, he is definitely my favorite mahasiddha, but if he really stops the sun, you would think that such a cosmologically significant event would be noticed by the Chinese, the Arabs, etc. In fact, we have to understand this story as a yogic metaphor (which is the way it is actually explained in the Caryagiti). It is a fun story. It ends with Avalokiteshvara telling Virupa to stop being a magical terrorist. Then Virupa merges with a statue of Avalokiteshvara in S. India, meaning that all along we are to understand Virupa has reached the same level of realization. 

For example, the essentials of man ngag sde practice, its anatomy and so on, can be communicated in a few words. We do not need three volumes of primary text, four volumes of secondary texts and four more volumes of commentaries to explain the main points of rushan, semzins, tregchod and thogal. But people like to write books, and they like to elaborate things. Most of what is discussed in the 17 tantras is distilled into a few pages in the Vima Nyingthig, in the three testaments of the Buddhas. This latter text then sets the structure for all the later Nyinthig termas. 

As you know, I personally take the view that just as Mahāyāna Buddhism went through stages of development, so did tantra. I happen to think that the authors who wrote Mahāyāna down wrote down a brilliant and sublime teaching. I happen to think the same of the authors of the tantras. But I also think they were human beings and as human beings, they responded to social and political pressures, just as the Buddha clearly did in the Pali canon teachings. 

So this is how I reconcile my critical approach to the text I read, and my practice. I understand that the tantric texts of all classes of tantra are just a reflection of a process of yogic experimentation and practice, as well as guides to reproduce those experiments. For me it is interesting to understand the gradual evolution of the Buddhist tantric yogic tradition, and I take the view that it did evolve gradually in the custody of people who were practicing its precepts, just like Mahāyāna, just like Abhidharma. I understand the claims of lineage origin to be a response to critics outside this or that lineage to validate the lineage to prospective new students. I understand that there are various strategies in Tibetan Buddhism to attract new students. Among these and not restricted to these are the Nyingma strategy, "highest teachings, newest revelation, the most blessings"; the Kagyu strategy is "Most faith, most blessings"; Gelug strategy is "Most systematic, most blessing", the Sakya strategy is "Clearest Indian lineages, most blessings", etc. These are the claims these schools make, they do not cover all the claims these schools make. Other claims all based around the lineage founders, the texts, etc. And of course we already see that within a few short years of Buddhism coming to the west, we have all kinds of tertons popping out of the wood works. 

So in the end, Tibetan Buddhism is moving here, and we should expect that it will undergo rigorous critical examination, just like it did in the early days in Tibet. I suggest that if we revise our expectations of what makes a text "legitimate" then the process will be less painful. But if we insist on literal adherence to narratives such as the Great History of Zhangton as a criteria for being a player, then I think that Vajrayāna is doomed in the west.

There is no need to talk about ontology since the the four extremes are all invalid.

In case you missed it:

When we talk about the basis, we are talking about what is termed by the sgra thal 'gyur commentary as the tantra of primal nature [rang bzhin gyi rgyud]:


The tantra of the basis is the reality [gnas lugs] that is present [gnas pa] to be known. It is not cultivated by buddhas nor do sentient being contrived it through cleverness. It is not established by any words or letters. It is the intrinsic reality of the great perfection free from extremes that is in no way incomplete. 
The tantra of the path is two-fold: the path is made into a direct perception and into a post-meditation phase on the basis of the capacity of different people. 
The tantra of the result is the naturally perfected tantra of the three kāyas and the originally pure tantra of the exhaustion of dharmatā. 

This passage in the sgra thal 'gyur commentary is an elaboration upon a discussion found in an early 11th century text, The Mahāyānapathakrama by Subhagavajra:

Now then, the tantra of the basis is the nature of the two truths; the method is the two stages; and the result is the two kaȳas, the dharmakāya and rūpakāya. Therefore, since the result is obtained when the method is cultivated in dependence on the basis, a tantra is so called because it connects.

There is no posited basis for those multiple, individual consciousness since they are all empty, free from extremes. 

As explained before, the term སྦྱི་གཞི, generic basis, is just a generic set of attributes that all shes pas possess. That is why the sgra thal 'gyur clearly explains that shes pa, consciousness, exists in all buddhas and sentient beings, and that is has two basis states, pure and impure and so on.

We can continue around and around on this if you want, but there really is no further satisfactory answer. Instant presence, rig pa, is just a quality of one's mind.

As soon as one accepts that all of this is just a way of trying to describe how minds become deluded, and then free from that delusion, then at that point one has understood the purpose of the discussion. If you think Dzogchen texts are positing some permeating basis which supports instantiations of buddhas and sentient beings, then you have understood nothing.

As you know, in the end I have concluded that the Dzogchen theory of a basis is not really different from the Sakya theory of the all-basis cause continuum, or the Kagyu theory of "mahamudra of the basis". All three are clearly based on the Uttaratantra of the Guhyasamaja's statement:

A tantra is a continua. 
That become three,
divided by basis, likewise, nature, 
and nothing to abandon, 
the basis and the nature are the cause, 
likewise the result has nothing to abandon. 
The basis is called “the method.”
The topics of tantra are included in three.

The mind is the basis, it doesn't have "the basis". 

Sure, mind is just a convention, so is "basis", so is "mental event", etc. When subject to analysis, each term is just as incoherent as the other two. 

Therefore, all of this discussion of the basis, the arising of the basis, mind, mental events, etc., is all strictly conventional. 

Further, there is ample evidence that Dzogchen tantras are merely discussing the nature of individual consciousness and nothing more.

Two things about Zhangton. Zhangton demonstrates a very shaky grasp on events in the 11th century, placing atisha one hundred years too early and so on. Second, fabulous tales were very believable to Tibetans (and many of their students) right up to the present day. 

When I have discussions with Tibetans about all of this, they demonstrate a lot of indifference to these issues, mainly being concerned with focusing on one practice or lineage. Plus they are basically hostile to text critical analysis of their tradition unless it is within the context of traditional lineage concerns. So for example, if Gorampa criticizes the kun byed rgyal po it is one thing, but if a Western scholar does the same thing it is quite another. They distrust the motives of Western scholars, and dislike the  impression that Western scholars like Gyatso, Davidson, Germano etc., are just doing this because they need a job. Whereas a critic like Sapan or Gorampa is regarded as being a realized person (with Sakya), so their opinions carry great weight. 

Many western students have the same attitude. I have heard students of ChNN proclaim that if ChNN says something is so, we must believe it is so. 

Finally, the purpose of lo rgyus, narrative accounts, are to generate faith in the lineage. Therefore exaggeration and so on are the norm in such accounts because they generate a dramatic tone which fosters receptivity. In the Indo-Tibetan tradition it seems, the more fantastic the better it is received. Of course there are skeptics, like Taranatha, who found the whole literature of the Padma Khathangs to be worth less than the paper they were written on, so he provided the account of Padmasambhava he heard from his Indian master, Buddhaguptanatha as a corrective to the exaggerations of tertons like Nyang ral. 

So what I observe in Tibetan literature of this kind is a kind of one upsmanship, like that one sees when comparing the simpler and less elaborate "sems sde" origin stories with the elaborate story of the man ngag sde lineage, or comparing the increasingly detailed accounts of the early masters of Lamdre as time moves on, or the increasing detailed bios of Milarepa, etc., or the the increasingly detailed bios of Padmasambhava resulting in a 12 volume one "revealed" by a Bon master in the 19th century. 

These are, in my view, facts of text that we have to accept. 

In terms of Dharma there is basically no difference in meaning between the words in the "emptiness" mantra, oṃ svabhāva śuddha sarvadharma svabhāva śuddho' ham (The nature of all phenomena is pure, also my nature is pure) and the term "original purity". 

In the end, these issues of text origin should be kept separate from practice. I think that the traditional accounts should always be presented, whether we really believe them or not, when we are being presented with teachings for practice. When we are studying these texts for their history however, we should subject the texts to all the best methods of text criticism, archaeology, history and so on that we can muster. In some people's mind this will cause them to lose faith in this or that lineage or tradition, and that is a pity, but that is also the price of scholarship. Many Christians lost faith in Jesus because of text criticism that began to be used by german scholars in the 19th century, but we, as Buddhists, don't really care if Christians lose their faith. 

My contention is that if we lose our faith in Buddhadharma (due to text criticism and a better understanding of history) because the origin of some text turns out to have been originally written Tibetan and not some Indic language, than our faith was is pretty shaky to begin with and is not based on the principles of Dharma but rather on some strange beliefs that we have decided to cultivate. If we lost faith in the man ngag sde tantras because it turns out they were written in Tibetan in the 11th century, and not taught by some ancient teacher in a heaven during the first eon, then it means we have not really understood the theory and practice contained in those texts on any level at all . If we lose our faith in Kalacakra because the notion that it was taught by the Buddha in a stupa in South India and then was later set down in writing by the seventh king of Shambhala, Mañjuśrīyasa, and only brought to India some 1000 years later during the 10th century turns out to be just a didactic legend, then it means we have understood nothing of the teachings contained in that tantra. If we decide that we have no faith in the Prajñāpāramita sūtras because it turns out that it is impossible they were recovered from under the ocean by Nāgārjuna then we have not understood one word of the Prajñāpāramita. 

I keep on stressing that what is most important about all Buddhist texts is not where they are from, but rather, what they say. We are left to our own devices to engage in the experiment and test for ourselves the truth of practices in Buddhist texts. When we have some evidence that the practices in these texts lead to the promised results, our faith moves from aspiring faith to unshakable faith -- but that unshakable faith does'nt mean that we then necessarily have to believe all the origin legends that accompany these texts. It means we have moved from hypothesis to confirmation for ourselves. 

In the meantime, there are interesting things to learn.

Since one's mind free of proliferation is the dharmadhātu
all buddhas enter into that freedom from proliferation. 

And:

A buddhahood that is an object of sight cannot be seen;
since buddhahood does not exist, also there is no name "buddhahood";
The teacher has said that since buddhahood designated by a name it is an error;
the mistaken path is obtaining buddhahood somewhere else.

Also the teaching of the all-creating kind

The Sanskrit originals for the 17 tantras are accounted for Zhangston's legend. They are asserted to be the sole copies brought from India with no other copies in India, hidden by Vimalamitra in Tibet just before he departed for China. The origin legends of all the other tantras are no more believable than Zhangton's. The difference of course is that there is no elaborate account of concealment and retrieval in Tibet to contend with for the gsar ma tantras. 

In gsar ma, the general mode of the introduction new teachings is through visionary encounter.  Marpa meeting Naropa, Sachen meeting Virupa, or through dreams.

"Vimalamitra", having clarified that sems, blo and yid are all synonyms for shes pa, states:

The wisdom that is encompassed by the mind is inseparable in all buddhas and sentient beings as mere mind, but since it ultimately pervades them without any nature at all, that [wisdom] is encompassed by the mind [shes pa] of each one.

If you choose to see it that way. I don't. I see it very much along the same lines as placing the words of Mahāyāna sūtras in the mouth of the Buddha, when it is impossible that the historical Buddha even spoke one word of them, let alone all 108 volumes of them and more. I evaluate the texts on what they say, not on the basis of their supposed origins. I think it is a superior approach when a text is evaluated on its actual content rather than who supposedly spoke it.

Let me put it another way, when Amoghavajra [i.e. Shingon tradition] claims that Nāgārjuna took the tantras out of an iron tower in South India, I also do not believe that story. That does not mean I think that the practice of the Vajradhātu mandala is spurious or worthless.

Given the environment of the 11th century, if the authors of the 17 tantras came out and said "We wrote these books, and because we have realized the meaning contained therein, you should practice this" no one would have believed them.

I am a Buddhist, and while I sympathize with the suffering of any sentient being, I also recognize that the suffering of any sentient being comes strictly from their own karma and no one else makes it for them. You are making a common error in assuming that karmic causes and conditions are "interdependent" in a broader sense. They are not. 

The discussion of general cause and condition comes first. Then the subject of dependent origination. Finally, the discussion of karmic cause and condition, i.e. how afflicted minds act, and what kinds of results they can expect to ripen as a result of those acts, both positive and negative. My karma does not ripen on you, and you have no hand in making it. Your karma does not ripen on me, and I had no hand in making it.

I am not dismissive of their experience. One cannot contextualize one's experience (be social, political or economic) in Buddhism in absence of the teaching of karma, which states quite plainly that all sensations, pleasant, unpleasant and neutral, the social status into which one is born, one's opportunities in life, and so on result from one's own past actions in previous lives. Buddhists, of whatever "race" are well advised to use this precious human birth (that they may use to attain liberation) to good use. Meanwhile, as part of their practice, they can devote themselves to whatever social causes strike their fancy depending on their social, political and economic concerns. Thus, if you are a person of color and you wish to devote yourself to causes involving people of color, fine. But don't buy into the non-Buddhist narratives of oppressors and victims, the non-Buddhist narrative of privileging one form of sentient life (human) over the lives of billions of other kinds of sentient life. The teaching of karma is not fuzzy, warm, and it does not feel good. The teaching of karma indicates that what we experience in this life is a result of how we have acted in past lives. If we are oppressed in this life, we can be sure that in a past life we were oppressive, and so on. 

This is not a recommendation for inaction or indifference to the plight of people are not so fortunate as to have a precious human birth where they can meet the Perfect Dharma and practice it. We have to be aware of the plight of others and help where we can, and when we are asked to, it's "the bodhisattva" thing to do, and not because we wish to turn others into coreligionists. But in the end, don't ask me to respect you because you are a person of color. I respect you already because you are a human being.

The "natural condition" as you call it, isn't something real; it is baseless. It isn't out there, like "atoms", "stars" and "galaxies"; it isn't inside like "blood cells", "mitochondria", etc. This "natural" condition is just the nature of your own mind. It is not an objective condition— there is no "objective condition" because there is no "subjective condition". There is no "natural" condition because there is no "unnatural condition". 

There is no wisdom apart from the mind and there is no consciousness apart from the mind, there is no buddhahood apart from the mind, there is no delusion apart from the mind, there is no samsara apart from the mind, no nirvana apart from the mind. Apart from the mind, nothing else needs to be recognized. 

The mind is not real because it cannot be established, it is not unreal because one cannot deny that one is feeling, thinking and so on, therefore we say it has "no reality" i.e. there is no state of being that pertains to the mind, since the mind is beyond any extreme, it's nature is sheer clarity and emptiness inseparable. You won't find the mind by resting your attention on a rock, you won't find it by resting your attention on a thought, you won't find even if you rest your attention on the mind's own sheer clarity. You won't find it even if you ascertain sheer clarity is empty. You won't find in nāḍīs, vāyus and bindus, deities, mandalas, etc. 

However, that being said, if you do not have a proper method, your afflictions will not cease, you will not gather the twin stores of merit and wisdom, you will not expand your mind to the point of omniscience and you will not realize buddhahood.

There is no samaya that says we must believe this or that text is a product of someone's realization, even a tantra or a sutra. 

Why do you think there was and is controversy around things like Shugden, Termas etc.? Certainly the Shugden folks believe their protector comes from someone's realization. The people who disbelieve in Shugden think the person who tells them Shugden is a mistaken practice is realized. 

In general the recommended approach is that if you are not sure of a teaching, don't criticize it because you might unwittingly criticize and authentic teaching of the Buddhas. 

However, origin stories are not Dharma. Disbelieving the claim that some text was written by Padmasambhava or Vimalamitra, then hidden and then dug up 800 years later in some backwater in Kham where it is unlikely Padmasambhava ever set foot hardly constitutes breaking "samaya". Disbelieving that Buddha taught Guhyasamaja to Indrabhuti I hardly constitutes breaking samaya. Disbelieving that the eighteen tantras fell on the roof of King Za's house and then he had to recruit Kukuraja to understand them is hardly breaking samaya. 

"Breaking samaya" means trying to turn people against the Dharma. No one is doing that here.

Of course. Not all Mahāyāna sūtras present the Buddha in the best light, for example. We have clear evidence of Buddhist/Hindu intertexuality, etc. Some termas are much clearer than others. Some terma cycles borrow entire texts authored by early Tibetan scholars and attribute them to people like Vimalamitra. Some tantras are more interesting than other tantras. Some authors of these texts were more realized than others. 

I think we are long past the time where we can accept the traditional accounts of Buddhist textual origins. We have far too much evidence of the gradual development of Buddhist texts over centuries to doubt that the evolution of Buddhist ideas from the Nikayas to Vajrayāna is anything other than human beings working out their religious impulses in a Buddhist context.

It does not mean that I disagree with or disregard the ideas expressed in these texts, quite the contrary, I agree with them very much and regard them highly overall. I am after all a practitioner. I simply do not need to subscribe to the origin myths of Mahāyāna and Vajrāyāna texts to find religious meaning in them for myself, just like I do not need to believe in Mt. Meru to do mandala offerings.

In all of this, I am not saying any thing that I have not maintained for years. The difference is that now I have more confidence in my perspective because I have read more texts more closely.

I didn't say that. 

What I do maintain is that for a Buddhist things like race, class, gender, etc., really should not be very important as identity markers for oneself as well as for others. To some extent is unavoidable, because we are human beings. But they are not a desiderata, they are barriers. Sanghas that consciously define themselves on the basis of race, class or ethnicity go against the Buddha's message that dismantled caste. Then it winds up being:

The White Power Sangha
The Black Power Sangha

etc. 

This is wrong. If there is a Buddhist teacher you want to study with, then go and study. Do not pay attention his or her race, do not pay attention to the race of the people attending that teacher. 

Actually, there is no such thing as race. Race is a stupid word. There are different cultures, languages and histories, but is only one human race. There are no black people, no white people, only human people.

You say "revealed", I say "composed".

The tradition has it that Dangma Lhungyal takes the "seventeen" tantras out of their place of concealment around 906. But the fact that Dangma knows about the Kadampas and mentioned Atisha by name, and the fact that Dangma and Chetsun were a contemporaries of Drogmi Lotsawa, and the fact that four of the 17 tantras use terms introduced to Tibet by the Hevajra tantra places the composition of all seventeen tantras in the 11th century, and the composition of a large number of them in the late 11th century. There is virtually no evidence of the type of completion stage practices using nāḍīs, vāyus and bindus that we find in the yogini tantras in Tibetan texts prior to the 11th century, especially not in Dzogchen texts. It is only with the seventeen tantras that we begin to find a body centered praxis in Dzogchen. It is my opinion, not very popular amongst "the faithful", that man ngag sde was elaborated as a response to the arrival of new tantras from India. We even have Nyingma masters [Rog Ban] from the early 12th century complaining about these new fangled heretical practices involving nāḍīs, vāyus and bindus borrowed from Hindus [probably a complaint about Kalacakra's use of Hindu terms for the rasanā, lalanā and avadhūti].

Well, kriya tantra isn't, really. It is only when we come to "carya" and "yog"a tantras that we begin to find statements that indicate there is something more rapid than sūtra.

Well, it is just how the texts appear over time that makes it seem that way. Yogacara and its sutras were a reaction to Prajñāpāramitā and Tathagagarbha sūtras. So too with the tantras, each successive generation of texts claims its superiority over the previous generation, both in the primary texts themselves as well as the commentaries written by their exponents. 

Thus you have gsar ma claiming its superiority over snying ma; mother tantras over father; ati yoga over mahā; unsurpassed secret cycle declaring its superiority over sems sde and klong sde, as well as the outer, inner and secret cycles; yangti over everything else; terma over karma; Gelugs declaring Tsongkhapa's views superior to the previous Sakya school they grew out of and so on. One aspect of the history of Buddhism is but the history of a contest of puffery and exaggeration.

No, I think the original empowerments were the elaborate abhisheka mandala rituals found in what is now known as "kriya tantra" which never included a "nature of the mind" or "formless" abhisheka until we come to what are now known as "yoga tantra". It is characteristic of kriya tantra empowerments that they only have a body and speech blessing, but no mind blessing. 

Then I think "yoga" tantra morphed in anuttarayoga tantra into India. In Tibet yoga tantra, and especially the Guhyagarbha, morphed into mahā and ati, with anu added later because Tibetans did not go to receive any new teachings in India due to the economic chaos that caused the fall of the Tibetan empire in the 840's. 

In India, anuttarayoga tantra morphed into the father, mother and Kalacakra tantras, with Kalacakra representing the final development of Indian tantras; just as the 17 tantras represent the final development of Tibetan tantra. In other words. the evolution of tantras was complete in the 11th century, as process that started in the 7th century. 

One thing you should understand that is that the tantras written in Tibet are far more homogenous than post 8th century Indian tantras. I chalk this up the isolation of Tibetans from India during this period between 850 and roughly 1000.

Also I should add, the realization of the Anuttaratantra in general lead to the Mahāmudra dohas and the Dzogchen lungs.

Well, it is certainly true that realization is the goal of any vehicle within Buddhadharma. 

The point is that with the elaboration of Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra (not yet known as such in India in the 8th century), the completion stage became a fully elaborated set of practices unto itself. These eventually divorced from the creation stage in the seventeen tantras and their instructions. The fact that there is ambivalence about divorcing Dzogchen from the two stages about this is indicated by such texts as the Khandro Nyinthig, which reimport Mahāyoga and Anuyoga practices, as well as borrow the sexual yoga practices of Ghantapada's Five Stages. Not only this, but the fact that the seventeen tantras elaborate a whole brand new set of empowerments, and that there are recommendations in The Heart Mirror of Vajrasattva and the Self-Arisen Vidyā to practice the three inner tantras as a unity indicates that Tibetans had considerable ambivalence about discarding the classic gradual path system of the inner tantras. 

In other words, like Mahāmudra Dohas, the original Dzogchen lungs literally describe the state of realization itself, and they do not describe a path at all. They describe a result. The three traditions of "sems sde" each take different approaches to the material found in the 21 bodhicitta texts; with the upshot that they were combined into a single system at Kahthog called "rgyud mdo rdzogs", i.e. the practice of The Tantra, the Compendium, and Dzogchen. 

The key point you are missing, Magnus, is that for something to be secret mantra —and Dzogchen is part of secret mantra— it must be predicated on an empowerment of some kind and a guru. Even the five original lungs of Vairocana make this abundantly clear.

Since the place of Samantbhadra arises, there is not need for the creation and completion samadhis. 

Or the Vajrasattvamāyājālaguhyasarvādarśa-nāma-tantra, included in the rNying ma rgyud 'bum as well as the bKa' 'gyur, states:

Any teaching of the stages of the method of creation and completion are included in the Māyājāla

No one asserted that world was made by judging and observing. The Dzogchen view of the world is that it's appearances generated by traces in the minds of sentient beings, and that the traces in the minds of sentient beings have the capacity to generate appearances for other minds. So all of our minds together, because of our strong traces to which we are habituated from beginning less time, generate the appearances of the Universe together. Of course this does not mean that the traces of the mind have some state other than bodhicitta. They arise because bodhicitta, the nature of the mind, has not been recognized. 

Appearances range from function to non-functional, but in the end they merely appearances of our own minds. The point of view of Dzogchen, and indeed, Vajrayāna in general, is that there is nothing "out there" which objectively exists.

Well, for example, in the system of the Vajra Bridge, Kunzang Dorje, a disciple of Dharmabodhi who lived in the later 12th century, describes the nāḍīs very clearly as follows:

"Since it is necessary to understand the critical point of nāḍīs and vāyu, though there are 80,000 nāḍīs in a single body, they are gathered into five in the organ of the heart [don snying]. Blood and vāyu exist in the heart nāḍī, the lalanā, which exists on the right. Lymph [chu ser] and vāyu exist in the lung nāḍī, the rasanā, which exists on the left. Vāyu and bindu exist in the kidney nāḍī, the avādhuti (kun 'dar ma), which exists in the middle. The liver nāḍī generates the pure essence of the sense organs, exists above, and illuminates [sense] consciousness. Since the spleen nāḍī is the lower end of the avadhuti, it produces bliss."

They are necessarily physical structures which contain physical things such as vāyu and bindu, blood and lymph, feces and urine etc. This is merely one example I can provide out of many.

The there is no end. You cannot arbitraily decide where to end the dependency. In this case, you can only designate the universe as "a self" since everything in it is a dependent relationship. Remember, the material aggregate includes all sense organs and sense objects! 

For the reason a so called "dependent" self should be rejected out of hand as incoherent. "Identity" merely exists as a designation upon a collection of parts. For example, you have "a car" because this collection of parts functions according your expectations; you have a "broken car' when it does not; and when it is an scrap yard, it is called "a dismantled car", for example, "that is a door from a BMW". But there is no dependent identity. "Identity" is merely a convention, and purely a product of designation upon an appearance, nothing more. The identity we impute is a designation based on an appearance, but the fact that identity is not dependent on the appearance can be understood from all the different identities that can be imputed upon an appearance, "Human", "Malcolm", "Löppon", "Asshole", "Heretic", "Buddhist" and so on.

A self is merely a designation, and does not exist apart from designation. It has no parts.A self cannot be found in a part, nor in all of the parts combined. This is why there is no "dependent self". If there were a "dependent" self, it would have to be shown which part is the key part upon which it depended. Since a self cannot be found in one of the aggregates, all of the aggregates or separate from the aggregates, for this reason one cannot accept the existence of a so-called "dependent" self. In fact the two terms are mutually exclusive, like "dependent inherent existence".

This only changes when we come to the man ngag sde tantras. For this as well as other reasons, I place the composition of the bulk of the seventeen tantras no earlier than 1020-1030 with the sgra thal 'gyur, the mu tig phreng ba, the rig pa rang shar and rang grol as well as the bkra shis mdzes ldan being the last.

All the channels are described in the Buddhist tantras as physical structures. They are called "subtle" (sukṣma, phra) because they are very fine, not because they are immaterial or made of some quasi-material. For example, according to Kālacakra, the lower tips of the three main channels produce urine, feces and reproductive fluids. That is hard to do if they are not physical.

All the channels form during gestation in the womb. This is the same in Dzogchen.

In addition, a so called “pandita” is described as “A scholar in the foundation of outer and inner objects of knowledge.” A so called “kusali” is described as “One who has the most dedication inwardly after severing all outer distractions.”
In terms of actual perfect Buddhahood: the first, having become knowledgeable about all objects of knowledge, has severed doubt through hearing, reflection and meditation. Then, because of severing doubt through meditating which makes samadhi essential, the pandita gradually attains Buddhahood after actualizing the Dharma of realization. A kusali necessarily has the same basis, but when considered alone, a pandita is closer to Buddhahood.

There is no "dependent" self, there is only a designated self. Apart its designation, the self, such as it is, is the son of a barren woman. If there were a dependent self, it would exist designated upon its parts, like a car or a cup. So what are the parts of the self upon which it is designated?

What I am saying is that what is pointed out is the nature of the mind, the mind essence, which you will never find when you look for it, apart from the looking itself, which when sought, is not findable either because it is free from extremes.

To be perfectly honest, as I have said before, from a textual POV, Dzogchen is filled to the brim with sectarian polemics. It is the most sectarian teaching in Tibet.

Because Madhyamaka negates everything completely. But that does not mean that the Dzogchen view of freedom from extremes is any different at all from the Madhyamaka view of freedom from extremes, for in fact they are formulated in precisely the same way. Further, Madhyamaka is not focused on the person, but rather in eliminating any sorts of reifications about existence, etc., whereas Dzogchen is concerned with explicating the nature of the mind. In other words, from a Madhyamaka POV there is nothing to point out, since nothing is established. From a Dzogchen point of view, and Vajrayāna in general, there is something to point out, i.e. the nature of mind, an empty clarity.

Buddhist texts need to have their own own distinctive terminologies in English, just as they do in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan in order to clearly demarcate our teachings and philosophy from those of other traditions. For this reason then using terminology like "ground of being" for gzhi is wholly inadequate.

Who said tathatā was supposed to be interesting? Not the Buddha:

“Hey, hey, apparent yet nonexistent retinue: listen well! There is no object to distinguish in me, the view of self-originated wisdom; it did not exist before, it will not arise later, and also does not appear in anyway in the present. The path does not exist, action does not exist, traces do not exist, ignorance does not exist, thoughts do not exist, mind does not exist, prajñā does not exist, samsara does not exist, nirvana does not exist, vidyā itself does not even exist, totally not appearing in anyway.”

-- Unwritten Tantra

“Venerable Śariputra, if one sees it like so, all phenomena are empty, without characteristics, non-arising, unceasing, without stains, and not free from stains; not decreasing, not increasing. 
“Śariputra, in emptiness there is no matter, no sensation, no ideation, no formations, no consciousness, no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body,  no mind, no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no contact. There is no eye element up to no mental element, and also nothing up to the element of mental consciousness. 
There is no ignorance; there is no end of ignorance; up to there is no aging and death and no end of aging and death. 
Likewise, there is no suffering, cause, cessation and path.
There is no wisdom, nothing to obtain, and also nothing not to obtain. 

-- The "Heart" Sutra

All the things in relative reality come about, in Dzogchen parlance, from a mind that does not recognize its own display. But it takes a mind that does not recognize its essence to produce that relative. There is no mind-essence other than in the mind.

It is an entirely dualistic metaphor, from where to the images in this mirror arise? In any case, your interpretation that the basis is an undifferentiated unity is not supported in Dzogchen tantras. It is probably not actually supported in gzhan stong either, at this point I am too busy to look. 

The Mind Mirror of Samantabhadra states:

The self-originated ultimate garbha,
in the manner of being perfect without being generated, 
is a brilliant mirror existing in all.

The marginalia notes that the mirror is the wisdom of vidyā, which as we know is what the instantiated basis is termed. So we can clearly see that this self-originated, ultimate garbha is just a term for the mind-essence. 

The Self Arisen Vidyā Tantra:

The light rays of all worlds issue forth
from the mirror of perfect mind.

The view of freedom from extremes as explained in Madhyamaka is not the slightest bit different than the view of freedom from extremes as explained in Dzogchen. That is why ChNN cites Sakya Pandita's Analysis of the Three Vows when he describes the view of Dzogchen, the full quote as follows:

Tough indeed there are levels of view
in Śravaka and Mahāyāna,
it is never explained there is a division of views
in Pāramitā and Secret Mantra.
If there were a view superior to 
the freedom from proliferation of the Pāramitā,
that view would contain proliferation. 
If [the view of secret mantra] is free from proliferation, there is no difference. 
Therefore, the view that is comprehended
with explaination is the same, 
nevertheless, secret mantra is superior
in the methods for realizing freedom from proliferation. 

Longchenpa also admits that freedom from extremes in Prasanga and the Dzogchen view are the same. 

Honestly, I don't see where the controversy is.

The article you mentioned is a mess. First of all, the term that gzhi translates is sthana, not aśraya. It just turns into a muddle from there. 

In terms of the origins of the term, it was indeed coined by Tillich to show that "God must be called the infinite power of being which resists the threat of nonbeing." [Systematic Theology, Vol. pg. 64] You can see why such borrowing is tempting, "The ground of being has the character of self-manifestation; it has logos character" [Systematic Theology, Vol.1 pg. 158]

A large problem for people who are approaching Dzogchen is that they fall back into classical western philosophical categories. Indeed, Günther wrote once that Dzogchen essentially is not different than Parmenides's theory that whatever was contingent as non-being and whatever is permanent is being. Tillich writes: 

"The Orphics, the Pythagoreans, Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides were driven to their philosophy by the awareness that the world they encountered lack ultimate reality. But only in Plato does the contrast between existential and the essential being become an ontological and ethical problem. Existence for Plato is the realm of mere opinion, error, and evil. It lacks true reality. True being is essential being and is present in the realm of eternal ideas, i.e., in essences. In order to reach essential being, man must rise above existence. He must return to the essential realm from which he fell into existence, In this way man's existence, is standing out of potentiality, is judged as a fall from what he essentially is. The potential is the essential, and to exist, i.e., to stand out of potentiality, is the lost of true essentiuality...In God there is no difference between essential and existential being. This implies the split is not ultimately valid and that is has no relevance for the ground of being itself. God is eternally what he is. [Systematic Theology, Vol.2 ppg. 21-22]

Examining this kind of presentation that the term "ground of being" arose out of, it is easy to see why those who are not trained in Indo-Tibetan scholastics as well as Western Philosophy will be very attracted to terms like "ground of being" relationship to the term "basis" or gzhi. 

The gzhi is strictly defined as lacking any essence, any svabhāva, in Dzogchen texts. Indeed its potentiality is made possible because of its empty nature. Without that coreless core, the processes of the basis by which the five lights shine out and so on are simply not possible. Emptiness, naturelessness, the absence of being, the absence of reality, the absence of extremes is precisely what makes the basis originally pure. As the sgra thal gyur tantra states:

Since there is no basis or foundation, dwell in emptiness.

The commentary merely notes that this line confirms the quality of the non-existence of one's mind. 

And further it states:

Due to being free from extremes, the middle does not exist. 

The commentary describes this as the Great Perfection view that is totally complete freedom from extremes:

The so-called intimate instruction of the view of the totally complete space of the great freedom from activities is the view of the totally complete freedom from extremes. Since that is free from the extreme of existence, it does not fall into the position of substantiality. Since it is free from the extreme of nonexistence, it exhausts grasping to emptiness. Since it is free from both existence and non-existence, it is free from apprehending the intrinsic nature of the apprehender, since it is free from the extreme of neither existence nor nonexistence, there is also no concept of mere non-existence.

Moreover, since it is free from the extreme of emptiness, it possesses the meaning of an intrinsically clear core. Since it is free from the extreme of being non-empty, the extreme of grasping to substantiality is avoided. Since it is free from a basis [gzhi], it is not conceived as being either "clear" or "empty", since it is free from both, there is nothing to prove nor negate. In the same way, combine [the above reasoning] for all such as the extreme of appearance and so on. 

Further because it is free from extremes it is not established many. Because it is totally complete, is is not established as one. Since that is free form one and many, it is the inexpressible dharmatā that is free from falling into extremes. 

Now then, if it is said "That is not Dzogchen because it begins to abandon extremes", since it is totally complete as existence, it means there is nothing to seek. Since it is totally complete as non-existence, it means there is nothing to abandon. Since it is complete as both, it means it is beyond accepting and rejecting. Since it complete as neither, everything becomes dharmatā. 

Likewise, since empty, not empty and so on are totally complete, therefore, "Great Perfection" means not falling into hope and fear or extremes. 

Moreover, because it is one, proliferation is severed, because it is many, there is not need to abandon anything. Further, because there are extremes, the middle is eliminated, because there is a middle, likewise, the extremes are eliminated. As such, if it is wondered why, it is because since it is free from extremes the middle does not exist. Because the extremes are negated, it is empty of a middle; since the middle is negated, likewise, there is no perception of extremes. Therefore:

"Because it is totally complete, there is nothing to dedicate."

And:

Since there is nothing more, there are no parts. 

In case someone still doubts whether the basis is just referring to one's own mind, Vajrasattvamāyājālaguhyasarvādarśa-nāma-tantra states:

The rootless mind itself
is the root of all phenomena. 

A passage from Bhavya's Madhyamakaratnapradīpa reinforces our understanding of this passage:

Just as from the root of the lotus
leaves and so on are continually produced, 
likewise, though the mind is insubstantial
it exists as the essence of all phenomena. 

This is the meaning of that: just as the root of the lotus is not connected with anything else, exists in water, and though that root does not penetrate anything, it is able to fill a great pond with leaves, flowers, and so on. Likewise, though the mind itself is insubstantial, it exists as the nature of all external and internal phenomena in the relative. 

Just as shoots of rice in a terrace
spread everywhere without roots, 
also the rootless mind itself
pervades the furthest reaches of space. 

Here, the meaning of this is: in ponds and terraces, the plants called "rice" are interlinked, they grow on the surface of a terrace with a yellow flower, their roots do not penetrate. In the same way, while the mind is rootless, it spreads throughout all space, existing as the nature of all phenomena.

The ultimate truth is nothing more and nothing less than cognition of what remains after the relative has been examined, or the non-conceptual cognition of true nature of the relative. 

To answer your earlier: causes and effects can neither be the same nor can they be different. If they are same, all causes are non-causes and all effects are non-effects. If they are different, causes remain non-causes and effects remain non-effects. When causes and effects are seen as they are, i.e., neither the same nor different, than causality, conventionally speaking, is preserved, without various identity problems. Nāgārjuna states:

It is not valid that arising and perishing are the same, 
nor it is valid that arising and perishing are different.

Again, if you are using the term of "ground of being", which is Christian theological term out of place in Dzogchen, you will run into many contradictions. 

These days many people express the language of Dzogchen in terms which are little more than a revenant of 19th Century British Idealism:

Our conclusion, so far, will be this, that the Absolute is one system, and that its contents are nothing but sentient experience. It will hence be a single and all-inclusive experience, which embraces every partial diversity in concord. For it cannot be less than appearances and hence no feeling or thought, of any kind, can fall outside its limits. And if it is more than any feeling or thought which we know, it must still remain more of the same nature. It cannot pass into another region beyond what falls under the general head of sentience.

But the mind is not a series of "discrete" mental moments in the way in which you are positing it. If you follow Nāgārjuna's reasoning, the mind is series of moments that are neither the same as nor different from each other. In the case of a person with āryan insight, there is no possibility of any disturbance between one moment of mind and the next because the mind stream has now been purified of causes for the arising of afflictions. 

Āryan insight does not transform a relative mind into ultimate mind; it is relative mind that has the capacity to take the ultimate as an "object". The Gelugpa use the useful example of subjective clear light and objective clear light, subjective clear light is the mind that apprehends objective clear light.

Nonsense, one merely moves from an afflicted relative to a nonafflicted relative. Once one's mind is free of afflictions, it cannot revert because the cause of being free of afflictions is āryan insight, which cannot be lost.

From an ultimate point of view, the language of affliction or nonaffliction is incoherent.
