I am just not sure how sound it is to give full empowerments over the web. There are some problems with this, and no agreement about what is correct and not correct. But it really cannot be the case that it is "whatever my lama says is correct." 

Meaning empowerments are a different story, there are good and sound reasonings to think these are fine over the web. Even so, being in the same space as the teacher is better, in my opinion. 

More importantly, I think that the online empowerment thing makes the whole thing a bit cheap. Then there is the issue of some teachers indiscriminately streaming live teachings to facebook with absolutely no restrictions on who can see them, and so on. There are a whole lot of issues with so called Facebook Dharma Teachings.

Mantras and dharāṇis are the utterances of the Buddha, uttered for a specific purpose, connected with a path. 

As to Tibetan language itself carrying blessings, no, I don't buy that it is any more special than any other language, nor do I buy that Sanskrit is somehow a special language either. If it were, then why are we not all reciting the Gayatri, and so on? The Buddha rejected śruti, and so should we.

Reciting the text has the function of engaging the lower levels of the nine stages of śamatha, which are perfected when focusing in the deities attributes. This how it is explained by Padmavajra.

It's a continuum. The way one remembers past lives is that in a state of samadhi, one recalls events in reverse. Recollection of past lives is an abhijñā, not special to Buddhism. But it does depend on development of samadhi. For example, when you recall what happened to you 15 years ago, there is no actual presence of any of the events of 15 years ago. They all do not exist. You cannot say they are in your mind, nor can you deny your memory of them. Nor can you claim there is some entity that stayed in your mind which allows you to recall them. But you still recall some events from 15 years ago. 

The same applies to past lives. The aggregates are serially connected, so there is some relationship with your past lives. Just the same, they do not exist now, and your ability to access those memories depends on your skill in samadhi, just as your abillity to recall past events in this life depends on your present mental clarity.

No, it is a deconstruction of Buddhist intellectualism, which is why yogacarins and gzhan stong pas dislike it so much. That’s why without proper understanding of Madhyamaka, people reify their experience of the nature of mind into something which is either existent (yogacara/gzhan stong) or nonexistent (gelug). It is for this reason Atisha declared that one must rely on Candrakirti for liberation. An experience of the nature of the mind is not enough for liberation.

The Madhyamakas reject is an unnecessary appendage, since all consciousnesses are just the aggregate of consciousness which is give different names when performing different functions. The reason it is rejected by Madhyamakas is that the yogacarins define the ālaya as a consciousness that engages in no processes of perception. Nāgārjuna II, in the Bodhicittavivarana equates the yogacāra theory with a magnet that just blinding attracts iron fillings. Jayānanda, in his commentary on Candra's Intro to the Middle Way has a novel take on ālayavijñāna that I have mentioned before. He states that the actual ālaya, the storehouse, if you will, is emptiness, and the vijñāna is what perceives it, hence the term ālayavijñāna properly understood, would mean "the consciousness that apprehends emptiness." This is very close to the meaning of mahāmudra and dzogchen when they talk of the dhātu and jñāna/vidya being inseparable.

No, but he was the only person who had a publisher/book store owner as one of his students. CTR's relationship with Sam Bercholz, more than any other single factor, was responsible for his swift rise and success in opening Dharma centers throughout North America. He founded Vajradhātu in 1973, the same year his first major book came out, Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. Indeed, it was among the first books on Buddhism I ever read, along with  Myth of Freedom, Three Pillars of Zen, Zen Mind Beginners Mind, Zen Bones, Zen Flesh, etc. in 1978. By the time I went to work in bookstore owned by member of Vajradhātu, Trident Books in Boston, in 1987. The Regent scandal was in the making, since Trungpa had died earlier that year. I never did join the local Dharmadhātu. I did do a couple of Shambhala levels, but found the teachers that I encountered in that program extremely unimpressive and pompous.

It means that the aggregates are a continuous steam of momentary events, the preceding moment being the cause of the next, hence they are serially connected. This is stated quite clearly by Nāgārjuna in the Verses on Dependent Origination. He writes:

6)	Although the aggregates are serially connected,
the wise are to comprehend nothing has transfers.

Therein, the aggregates are the aggregates of matter, sensation, perception, formations, and consciousness. Those, called ‘serially joined’, not having ceased, produce another produced from that cause; although not even the subtle atom of an existent has transmigrated from this world to the next.

“No self” is non-affirming negation. It does not fall into any extreme, since an existent self is not being negated.

The Platform Sūtra is not a sūtra. 

Nevetheless, the second turning of the wheel is definitive, not the third. This is easily proven through both scripture and reasoning. 

With respect to the tathāgatagarbha doctrine, if understood correctly, it can be understood as definitive, understood as you have presented it above, "If we speak of it as a womb, it is pure potential, but if we speak of it as an embryo, that means that there is something there. It is a positive," this is just eternalism, not better than the Hindu concept of self. So no.

In general, people should not practice thogal until they have understood the view, khregs chod, and stabilized it very firmly. That view is not an intellectual view, but is based on the experience of the nature of the mind during empowerment. That experiential view should be very stable. ChNN taught thogal very infrequently, largely because it is clear he had doubts about people's stability in the view.

Now, of course, there is no one who will continue those transmissions in the DC unless or until something changes.

If he did, he would have only presented trekcho and thogal, following empowerment. In fact, he mostly focused on trekcho, and only _very_ rarely did he teach thogal. 

What ChNN understood, finally, from Changchub Dorje was the meaning of the teaching on the basis (gzhi) a.k.a the primordial state a.k.a the nature of one's own mind, in Dzogchen. That was the topic that had eluded ChNN in his previous studies and teachings he had received. If one does not understand the Dzogchen teaching on the basis, one cannot understand the Dzogchen path. 

This is why he taught the way _all_ Nyingma teachers do, extensively teaching on gzhi khregs chod combined with anuyoga transformation practices until people are ready to practice the path, lhun grub thogal, which almost no one does seriously. In this respect he was very traditional. He also tried to explain to people that the unelaborate path of Dzogchen, of the Nyinthig teachings, the utterly secret unsurpassed cycle, was beyond the nine yānas, a fact stated in the seventeen tantras themselves as well as all major Nyinthig cycles, and countless commentaries. In fact, ChNN taught Dzogchen in an utterly traditional way, as anyone who has extensively studied the length and breadth of Dzogchen teachings knows, and has not fallen for the bullshit propaganda some people in DC repeatedly drone, which mainly derives from an incorrect understanding of the Kun byed rGyal po and other sems sde texts. ChNN repeatedly stated that sems sde concerned the teaching on the basis, and that in essence, it was about khregs chod. If one does not understand that basis, one can do Ati guru yoga and sing the SOV until the cows come home, but it isn't really Dzogchen practice. Authentic teachers of Dzogchen spend years emphasizing the teaching on the basis to their students until they get it right. ChNN was exactly that kind of teacher.

It's the opposite. Yeshi has done nothing but express hostility towards the DC since his father's passing (and for several years prior), blaming people like the D'Angelo brothers for stealing his father from him, when it fact, it was his father's choice with whom he spent time. Rather than being angry at the students his father surrounded himself with and to whom he dedicated his life, Yeshe should direct his unhappiness at its true source. If he wants to left alone, the DC should leave him alone. But he should also get out of the way, and stop this unhealthy tango.

Well, as far as I know, there is basically no one in the community right now, apart from Adriano, who actually has the necessary skills in Tibetan and English to give empowerments.  It is simply not enough to copy the meaning empowerments (don dbangs) Rinpoche used to give, let along the more complicated empowerments such as Longsal empowerment, or the empowerments for SMS, etc.. One has to be scholarly enough to know how to read the texts. Many people imagine that a direct introduction is enough. It may be for a few people with fantastic past life accumulations, but for most people it is not sufficient. This is why Rinpoche recommended that SMS people receive the Guhyagarbha, an Anuyoga empowerment in concise or long form, and the Khandro Nyinthig empowerment. 

There are really an endless source of issues here that cannot be addressed in any comprehensive way by the IDC, and they have made it clear that there is nothing they can do. 

Suppose someone starts giving empowerments and so on, of Mandarava. How can the DC sanction these? They can't. So, the DC still sinks. etc.

Leading students is not a simple matter of giving an introduction and then disappearing. It is a commitment to lead them on the path in a proper way. For example, like the commitment ChNN made to his students for decades and 600+ retreats. 

It is not some technical issue, which is what everyone treats it as, it is not merely a question of mechanics, "Have DI, then travel." 

The DC is, at present, running the risk of becoming a strange thing, unnormal, as the Boss used to say.

"Svatantra" and Prasanga are positions invented by Tibetans. It has nothing to with the facts on the ground in Indian Madhyamaka. 

Tsongkhapa is a wonderful teacher, but you should not imagine that his presentation is by any means the definitive one. It is not even the definitive one in Geluk, since there are many different trends in Geluk, and not even all famous Geluk scholars agree with everything Tsongkhapa wrote.

Śantideva does not address other Madhyamakas. He addresses only other tenet systems.

And this is how Secret Mantra, including Dzogchen, degenerates. Apparently you also were not paying attention to Rinpoche, when he chided people for their criticisms of creation stage because of the ancient Indian costumes. 

These things, quantum physics to Tiktok, are irrelevant to the question of liberation and freedom from rebirth. If someone does not accept rebirth, they cannot teach Dzogchen, much less Buddhadharma.

Title: Minutes of  Florida GOP Committee on Health Policy.
Content:
As seen on Twitter:





Hello everyone, and welcome to this meeting of the Florida GOP Committee on Health Policy. We're meeting today in this parking lot behind a Hooter's because Dale, our treasurer, died of COVID-19 last night and he had sole access to the accounts, so we couldn't rent out our usual conference room space in the Best Western. Apologies for any inconvenience and thoughts and prayers to Dale's family members who have not also died of COVID-19.

My name is Tad Horkington, and I'm honored to have been named president of the committee following the tragic death of Thomas Bilgenut, the interim president who last week died of COVID-19. Tom had, of course, replaced Hugh Frank, our previous president who died two weeks ago of COVID-19, along with his entire family and the youth football team he coached.

We will not read minutes from last month's meeting, as our committee secretary, Henry Sanford is presently hospitalized with COVID-19. We wish him and his loved ones well, send our thoughts and prayers and commend his courageous work on the "MASKS ARE TYRANNY!" float that appeared in the Labor Day parade in Vero Beach. Hopefully we can honor Henry and his team at our next meeting, assuming they are all off their ventilators or out of quarantine.

Getting to business, we need to sign off on the anti-vaccine-mandate statement that was put together by Belinda Thompson prior to her death from COVID-19. Thoughts and prayers to Belinda's family, all of whom were infected by Belinda at the vaccine protest she organized in a sealed tent outside the Granada Plaza Publix in Dunedin. 

The statement, which Belinda composed using her iPhone's voice dictation feature, reads: "The Florida GOP Committee on Health Policy hereby denounces Sleepy Joe Biden's TYRANNICAL attempt to COUGH mandate vaccines for anyone COUGH anywhere or at any COUGH time. We encourage all righteous COUGH Americans to stand up against this COUGH COUGH COUGH unlawful government overreach." I would propose we vote to approve that statement, but unfortunately, due to COVID-19 illnesses we do not have a quorum and, in fact, I am the only person in attendance today, and even I barely made it as I'm feeling a little under the weather. Jan Dodson, who is the only committee officer allowed to change the rules on voting, is unfortunately visiting her husband Zeke who is in Tampa General Hospital's COVID ward. They won't let her in because she patriotically refuses to wear a mask, so kudos to Jan for standing in the parking lot holding a sign that reads "STAY STRONG, ZEKE AND DON'T LET THEM MICROCHIP YOU!!"

COUGH! Excuse me. I'm sure it's just a cold. I will now conclude this meeting of the Florida GOP Committee on Health Policy. COUGH! I feel a bit feverish, so I'm going to go into the Hooter's without a mask and get a beer and some wings. God bless America.

What is karma? Please define your terms. 

I'll go first. "Karma is volition, and what proceeds from volition."

Volitions spawn verbal and physical acts. 

There are three kinds of karma: when meritorious, the result of karma is happiness and birth in higher realms when the conditions for their ripening assemble; when nonvirtuous, result is suffering and birth in lower realms when the conditions for their ripening assemble; and when neither meritorious nor nonvirtuous, result is neutral sensations and do not affect rebirth. 

What you are are referring to is karmaphala, the result of karma and karmavipāka, the ripening of karma. 

The result of karma will ripen solely on oneself, and it cannot be interfered with or prevented by anyone else other than oneself. Not even a buddha can remove some else's karma.

I never implied that one could not be influenced in positive or negative ways, nor that one could not influence others in positive and negative ways. But influencing others in positive and negative ways is still only's one own karma. And people's response to your influence is their own karma.

You are trying to tease out a very complicated set of issues. It won't work. Some teachers teach in the way above, most do not. That's because it depends on the person, and every person needs different things.

You should just find a teacher you trust, and practice exactly they way they prescribe. All this angst about this system and that system, the conflict between what western historians claim and what the tradition asserts and so on, is all a waste of your time.

No, this is not correct at all.

First the question of “deserved” is false. Karma  is unerring, and it’s result is commensurate with the intention that produced it. 

Mahayana Buddhism follows roughly the same principles of karma proposed by Sarvastivadins in Abhidharma.

The oppression of black peoples has economic consequences, but the cause is not is merely that they don’t get to share the profit of their labor, the reason they don’t get the same share as whites, all other things being equal, is that they are Black. Color, as a basis for for class, is far older in history than labor. It seems to be mostly an Indoeuropean issue.

At base, the problem in this country is mostly racism. JD forgets that the labor movement in its early days was largely an immigrant movement by people who were not considered white at all, apart from the Germans, who had tight control over the Socialist Party in this country, and dominated it, discriminating against Italians and so on. And then of course, there was the anti-semitism issue with Socialism as well, that is, it was regarded as a Jewish plot, until WWII made it unfashionable to openly hate Jews.

Remember, part of the reason Sanders lost the primary in 2016 is that he was not very clued into race. He was all about class too. He has since repaired that myopia.

Intersectionality and “identity” politics grew out the recognition in 1970’s by black radical lesbians that white radical lesbians wanted them to abandon black men. Black lesbians pushed back against this by pointing out they had a set of issues on the basis of the fact that not only were they lesbians, and thus subject to discrimination, but they were also Black, and subject to yet another layer of discrimination their white colleagues would never experience. So they refused to bow to the pressure put on them by the white lesbians to abandon Black men in the continuing struggle of Black people to secure their civil rights.

Of course, the real identity politics was the identity politics of the heterosexual, patriarchal, racist, white majority,

And no, they are not themselves racist nor lead to racism. Racism against who? “Whites?” That idea is completely unsupported

Well, how are white only covenants in deeds all over the United States not systemic racism?

How is the gradual defunding of public schools in North Carolina, etc., after desegregation, and the rise of private white only schools posing as Christian academies not systemic racism?

His thesis, that some disparities we see may originate in the sociology of Black people, may be true, however, how can he claim that very sociology was not formed by the deeply racist,  post-reconstruction period in the US? Long and short of it, he can’t. 

The arguments for systemic racism in America are far stronger than those against. But I know white people, Bill Maher, etc., take comfort in the soothing words of the few Black intellectuals who seek to disarm its more serious implications. Indeed, Friday, Bill was going off about wokeness again with George Will, and just repeated Fox News talking points. He was pretty unhappy his other guest, Christina Bellantoni pushed back hard against his assertions. He also, cluelessly, went off on the so-called Black national anthem, forgetting that the original poem on which our national anthem is based, explicitly supports slavery.

But its ok. There are hundreds of tertons who left huge collections of treasures that are no longer practice by anyone, anywhere, anymore. Only dribs and drabs of this and that are practiced. Bits and pieces.

I was not giving either dharma or moral advice, I was giving common sense advice. Of course, then there is the question of whether one is sleeping with a non-practitioner or not. It's technically just a branch downfall, if it is just ordinary sex. It's a root downfall, if you are visualizing them as your consort. 

I personally still think it is a bad idea, but if both partners are in agreement and the person you are sleeping with has told the other person of their intention to sleep with you, no problem. Just make sure you wear your party hat. 

I have however seen situations where one person thinks they are in a monogamous relationship, and the partner who wants to step outside the relationship claims to the new love interest they are in an open relationship. Now, this is not a case of sexual misconduct on your part, because you were misled, but it is sexual misconduct on their part. Sexual misconduct includes "adultery" in its non-legal sense, that is, when a person screws around on someone with whom they have a monogamous commitment.

"Wokeness" is just a meme pushed by Fox News as a dog whistle for racists, both consciousness and unconsciousness. 

However the term "woke" has a venerable history in black community in the US,  dating the 1930's:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke

"I advise everybody, be a little careful when they go along through there – best stay woke, keep their eyes open."

--Scottsboro Boys, Leadbelly

I will certainly use the term, just like the term "Yankee" for New Englanders, which came originally from a satiric song originally sung by the Redcoats, Yankee Doodle Dandy. Much to the chagrin of the British troops it was adopted as a marching song by the Continental Army, rather in the same way Trumpsters flocked to Clinton's disastrous appellation for them, "deplorables."

Yes, this is an important point. That's why even Sapan allowed that mantra recited with full confidence and devotion, even if a bit wrong, would be effective. 

The Chilli Chilaya story is just a bit of Nyingma butt hurt meant to denigrate Sapan's text, "How to pronounce Mantras" in his collected works. In that text he also covers Sanskrit regional pronunciations. The man had 30 Indian pandita tutors and spoke fluent Sanskrit, despite having never visited India. He was more Indian than Tibetan. Since Sapan was quite famous even in India, six tirthika panditas came to Tibet to debate him and lost,.  He was also extremely handsome and charismatic, leading to no small amount of jealousy on the part of his detractors. 

Gyalpo Rinpoche told me that the Drikung War with Sakya was entirely Drikung's fault. What he shared with me was that someone misheard Sapan talking about Jigten Sumgon, for whom Sapan had tremendous respect, even though there were points of disagreement. This man went back to Drikung and spread a false rumor that Sapan was slandering Jigten Sumgon. The rest is history.

According to Situ Panchen, the Drollo mantra is actually "Apabrahmsa." There is an established tradition that the dro wo lod is a corruption of khrodalokottara. However, the mantra is as it is. 

There are some mantras, like Black Mañjuśrī, which are clearly not all Sanskrit, same for the Kilaya "razor mantra." Especially in protector practices there are a lot of mantras that are mixed Sanskrit and Tibetan. Believe it or not, Dilgo Khyentse advised the Vajradhātu translators to translate the Tibetan words into English and recite those with English mixed with Sanskrit. Black Mañuśrī has "snying mgo la chod" in the mantra meaning "sever the heart and head." Imagine handing that out to beginners.

It's never a slight against one's teacher to correctly practice the Dharma. It says in no sūtra or tantra anywhere that there is a penalty for correctly pronouncing mantras. There are statements concerning mumbling, not reciting clearly, and so on. 

Tibetans cannot pronounce, without retraining, the syllble ṣa in the middle of a mantra. They cannot make that sound, thus bhaiṣajya, always is pronounced bhekhenze, aṣṭa is also akha, etc. Most of these errors come from Tibetans reading transcriptions of Sanskrit, but relying on the Tibetan pronunciations of ཙ་ཚ་ཛ་ཥ, which are used to represent ca, cha, ja, and ṣa. Sounds English speakers generally have trouble with are ṛi, ḷi, ṭa, ṭha, ḍa, ṇa, and ṣa. Also Tibetan regularly confuse བ་when it is used for va, rather than ba, since in texts often Tibetan transcriptions do not use the full ཝ་ , but short hand, བ, leading to pronunciations such as badzra for vajra, etc., or in extreme cases benzar. We and Tibetans also have a hard time with long and short vowels, a and ā, for example.

There is two schools of thought about this. I prefer Sakya Pandita's advice on this issue. He says that while one may achieve results though mispronounced mantras, if one has sincere faith, even so the result will be much slower. If you pronounce them clear and correctly, the result will be faster. 

Some lamas insist that you have to pronounce mantras the way they are received, but this makes no logical sense at all. Why? Because someone did not correctly pronounce the mantra they received from the original Indian master who introduced them to the mantra. 

The Chilli Chilaya story never happened. It also makes no sense. There is a similar story about the Fifth Dalai Lama who saw an old lady from his window doing korwa around a stupa. She also had an umbrella of light over her head. So he disguised himself and went to ask her what her practice was. She said "Kalacakra." He asked how she was pronouncing that mantra, and it was wrong. So he corrected her, and the next day he saw that her umbrella had disappeared, so he ran down and told her that he made an error, etc. you get the drift. This is also just an excuse Tibetans make for poor pronunciation.

These things are not subjective. 

Dhyāna/samādhi/samapatti states, in Buddhadharma, are defined by specific mental factors which arise in predictable and repeatable fashions. 

These things are discussed in Abhidharma, which concerns the first principles upon which Mahāyāna exegesis, including Chan/Zen are predicated. 

The observation of the arising, abiding, and passing away of concepts in the mind is an instruction for beginners in every school of Mahāyāna Buddhism, at least those that actually engage in the cultivation of śamatha and vipaśyanā. 

Further, there are many manuals, such as Asanga's text on śamatha, Kamalashila's manuals on cultivation and so on, as well as a very influential set of meditation manuals, which had great influence on people like Dogen, etc., by the fifth century Chinese master Chih-I. You should study them (which a teacher). 

Buddhism has an extremely rich literature on contemplative phenomenology, if you will, a literature that most people have no access to, because most of it is still locked away in Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Chinese, and Japanese. Further, all of the great masters spent years mastering these curriculums, combining their study with practice. This is why your post and subsequent remarks have met with general incredulity. You are simply out of your depth here. 

Since you are a modern, educated person, you have the Western attitude that somehow these pre-modern systems, which are not based on a modern medical understanding of anatomy and physiology, need to be helped in some way, an attitude that is frankly mere cultural chauvinism, not grounded in any facts. For example, while in Tibetan medicine they did not recognize things such as neurons, etc., they certainly were aware of circulation, the connection between the brain, sense organs, and the functions of limbs and organs in the body via nerves, since at least the 10th century (they dealt with a lot of traumatic injuries from warfare, and their methods of diagnosing organ and brain damage from traumatic injuries are remarkable and accurate). One of the consequences of this attitude is that you feel, based on a couple of short, classical texts, that you have somehow grasped the entirety of Buddhadharma and are now in a position to offer your esteemed opinion on such matters, arrogating to yourself the position of having discovered "a brand new method of using the the 4NT as a skillful means." You haven't discovered anything new. 

Even more ridiculous, you somehow insist that if your English phraseology is not found in classical texts, somehow this validates your so-called "discovery," as if all this is merely an exercise in creating a computational algorithm based on your conceptual observation of rising, abiding, and passing away of thoughts. You certainly do not know how to do meditation according to Buddhist instructions. You do not know how eliminate lethargy, nor avoid agitation, and a hundred other flaws and obstacles one confronts in meditation. You are talking to people, who in some cases, have spent years in solitary retreats practicing between 10-12 hours a day for extended periods of time. 

So you must forgive us for finding your tone hubristic and arrogant.

Correct. Some of us have been studying and practicing dharma since the mid-eighties, under qualified teachers, and have even gone so far as to become proficient in one or more primary Buddhist languages, as well as earning formal degrees in the subject in Buddhist institutions. 

The idea that someone, from books, with no education or training in dharma, can “discover” something overlooked for 2500 years is as preposterous as the notion that a five year old will be able to make any significant contribution to neural net research, let alone grasp anything more of it than the barest of rudiments. It’s actually insulting. Unfortunately, in this intellectual climate, such dilettantism all too common. 

So, Jim, just as you would have us respect your expertise in the area in which you earned your PhD, you should respect ours. Frankly, you are still in kindergarten, as far as Dharma is concerned.

Tai chi, on the other hand, I did not like, or least I did not like the instructor's approach, who insisted on connecting all the movements with a blow and its effects on an opponent. It turned me off to Tai Chi permanently. 

Tibetan martial arts are more straight forward: wrestling, archery, and hacking away at enemies with swords. No pretension towards subtlety or art.

Even the Buddha had to deal with Māra when he was on the seat of awakening. We have far more issues with Māra than the Buddha, since we are still ordinary, unawakened people, and our capacity for being deceived is far greater than our capacity to ascertain where we have erred. Every tradition of Buddhadharma has many teachings concerning experience, and how to judge an authentic experience from a deceptive experience (most of them). The problem is that, without a teacher, one will be unable to ascertain the difference, just a person with no knowledge of jungle plants will be unable to ascertain which ones will sustain them and which ones will kill them.

The Buddha gave a very detailed account of his awakening. So there is no need to argue what it was. It is quite well known. 

He first recalled 90k+ lifetimes, understood that these lifetimes were a result of karma, suffering. He then entered into the eight dhyānas to eliminate traces for rebirth in their corresponding lokas, but seeing for each of them that they were suffering, that there was a cause for that suffering, there was a cessation for that suffering, and a means to bring about that cessation. He then entered Vajropama Samadhi, eradicated all traces connecting him with samsara. That's it and that's all. No altered states of consciousness, etc. There was also an episode with Papayin Māra, aka Kamadeva, just prior to his final awakening. 

Samadhi, concentration, etc. create traces in rebirth in ordinary people. This is why it is said by many awakened masters prajñā must be cultivated first. What is prajñā? Right view, the first of the eight limbs of the path of nobles. 

Observing the rising, abiding, and passing away of thoughts is not in itself profound. Even a child can do this. That does not constitute right view. Right view is discussed here:

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... an.html#s1

If you wish to understand what samādhi is in Mahāyāna, then you should consult this sūtra, in particular chapter 13.

That does not answer the question, it only leads to another question, what is meant by "meditative absorption?"

My point is, how can someone know if they are in samādhi if they cannot define it? What are its characteristics? These things are very precisely defined by in Buddhadharma. There are very precise indicators for what a samādhi is, and what a samādhi isn't. There are also very many different kinds of samadhis, hundreds and thousands of them. 

People throw these terms around promiscuously, as if they understand what they mean, but frankly, in my experience, people often have no idea what they actually mean.

lha sde dkar po: here "pure" is translating dkar po, or "white." sde is not usually translated as race. It is basically a military term, and means "division, section, or segment." But given the context, I see why Adriano has chosen race (usually given for rigs). 

"let the pure (dkar po) people of Ling sing and dance!" (p 7)
"the deities have chosen a man from among the pure (dkar) Ling." (p 9)
"may his birth be like an ornament for the pure (dkar po) Ling!" (p 9)

"Dkar po" here as denotes good, virtuous, etc.

"as men do not distinguish good from evil, and do not know how to maintain purity (gtsang) and avoid impurity (dme), they create a basis for negativity" 

gtsang here has the connotation of moral purity, chastity, proper sexual conduct; while dme has the connotation of adultery and incest.

This is just an appeal to people with new age tendencies. You may notice that Bonpos do not teach their serious curriculum of Madhyamaka, Abhidharma, etc. These texts, though borrowing from Buddhist texts, are not simply copies of Buddhist texts as commonly thought. 

The modern Bonpos focus on rituals, and so on, things that have marketing appeal to a certain kind of Westerner. As far as I know, aside from singing bowls, with is complete and utter nonsense, virtually everything else one sees these geshes teach is sourced in authentic Bon traditions.

Yes, he was being less than inspiring. 

Here, I am pointing out the cause of lack of success in Vajrayāna practice (lack of devotion to one's guru as a buddha in fact), and for those who care to see it, the remedy (devotion to one's guru as a buddha in fact). 

On the other hand, Nāgārjuna stated in the Pañcakrama:

When falling off of a mountain peak, 
some think they are not falling, even though they are falling 
When the beneficial instruction of the guru is received,
some think they are not liberated, even though they are liberated.

So you see, I am pretty consistent, even across posts.

No one refutes the name. Everyone teaches a species of Connate Mahāmudra, including the Sakyapas. 

It is the method that is under dispute, and whether the way things that are presented by some early Kagyu masters is the way things were actually presented by Indian masters. 

If you are interested in such polemics you can read Sakya Pandita's Three Vows and Clarifying the Sage's Intent. His objections went unanswered by Kagyupas for nearly three centuries. 

We really don't need to litigate this in this forum. It's above our pay grade. It's best left for Khenpos to argue about. It's what they get paid for.

This is a difficult point in Tibetan Buddhism. The Sakyapas assert that there is no path of mahāmudra independent of the two stages, the Kagyupas do. The decision as to who is technically correct is above my pay grade. Both the Sakyapas and the Kagyus have produced many masters who realized mahāmudra.  So, it is best to decide on a lineage, follow it, and not get involved in polemical disputes over these issues.

Yes, the former is the creation stage, the latter is the completion stage without objects.

Ideally these are practiced in tandem, but beginners are generally encouraged to practice first one, then the other, from elaboration to nonelaboration. I've been at this for 30 years. I have met _very_ few people, less than a handful, who are capable of practicing trekcho in absence of some support.

The mind is always active. For example, Tilopa's dictim "Don't think" does not mean "Be an inanimate object." It means don't let oneself be ruled by or grasp onto concepts. That only works is if one has authentic vipaśyanā.

Generally speaking, this is sound. This is why we both agree beginners should, if possible, rely on lineage heads when seeking empowerments. 

However, my point in a now deleted post is that there are students of various capacities, and ratcheting everything up to the level of mahasiddhas every time someone mentions the gradual path is counterproductive, just as when someone is talking about setting a table with silverware, immediately jumping to how the table does not exist because it is empty, etc. is also counterproductive. 

You will certainly agree that there can be no mahāmudra realization without complete devotion to one's guru. Most people do not have that level of devotion, especially in the beginning, and usually only because of past life cultivation of the Vajrayāna path. Hence the reason we regularly make aspirations to encounter our guru in lifetime after lifetime. And, as we know, people usually overestimate their own level of competency.

Content:
The point missed here is that bhumis do not refer to realizations, paths do. Bhumis are just measures of qualities. 

 In terms of awakened people, there is the path of seeing (first bhumi), and the path of cultivation (second through tenth). These two paths make up the ten bhumis. The path of no more learning is buddhahood. 

The point is that when one has reached the path of seeing and entered the path of cultivation, buddhahood is inevitable, in some lifetime or another. 

So, Dogen was pointing out something important. On the other hand, the realization of a buddha and that of a first stage bodhisattva are not really that different. They have realized the same emptiness. The difference is only the level of cultivation.

There is no citation from any tantra I know of that says a guru can do so. This idea is inferred from the notion that those on the bhumis can know the minds of others. But most gurus are not bodhisattvas on the bhumis, despite endless propaganda about tulkus and so on. In fact, the Vajrayāna system was taught so that ordinary people can transmit the teachings, and that is stated in the tantras. There are examples of this in the 84 Mahāsiddhas, for example, the tale of Śantipa and Kotalipa. The former gave empowerment to the latter, and the latter attained mahamudra siddhi. To expressed his gratitude, Kotalipa flew through the air to visit Śantipa, who did not recall him, but when confronted with Kotalipa's realization, Śantipa requested teachings and attained mahamudra realization himself. A realized guru is not required by a student who has faith that their guru is a buddha.  Most of us do not have this sincere faith, even though we brag about this and that teacher's realization constantly. This is why main reason why people do not realize the fruit of Vajrayāna teachings in one lifetime.

That's the point. And it is very clear what the tantras say. For example, the Hevajra Tantra states:

The creation stage
and the completion stage,
the two stages in which to dwell evenly,
are the dharma explained by Vajradhara.             

There are many such citations in the tantras. Also Nāgārjuna states in the Five Stages:

Those wishing to practice the completion stage,
should abide well in the creation stage.
The method is the gradual path
said by the Buddha to be like a staircase.

So here, it is without dispute that Vajrayāna practice is a (comparatively) gradual path for those who do not attain awakening during the empowerment. It would be great if we were all like Saraha and Indrabhūti I, and attained awakening during the empowerment. But we aren't and we don't, and that's why we practice sādhanas, maintain samayas, and so on, the usual work of Vajrayānis. It is also recognized in Dzogchen teachings that most people cannot practice the direct Dzogchen path, as indicated by Mañjuśṛīmitra, and hence we practice the indirect path.

They may be more intelligent, more discerning, and have more experience (whatever that means), but outside of Buddhadharma, they don't have correct view.

Also, he excluded the possibility of pratyekabuddhas while his Dharma was present in the world. Of course, no one is binding you to accept this.

It's important differentiate epistemic nondualism with ontological nondualism. The former is recognition that dependent origination makes it impossible for one to adhere to views of permanence and annihilation, in other words, the middle way free from all extremes. The latter is the idea that there is only one thing without a second and that all diversity is a false perception of one thing. The latter view is not compatible with buddhadharma at all, including dzogchen. Dzogchen teachings directly negate the latter form of nondualism in many places, not to mention the other buddhist systems.

In Buddhadharma, this is called "following objects" and "being distracted."

In stable śamatha combined with mindfulness, one registers sense objects as they arise, but one never follows them. In Dzogchen, one makes contact with all sense objects, but one does not follow them or drift along with them. That is how "one-pointedness" is defined in the latter system.
