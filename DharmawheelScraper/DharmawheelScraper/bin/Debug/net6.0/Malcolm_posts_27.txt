No, but he included enough of the standard Vajrayāna machismo warnings to make it pretty clear he does not approve of the student's actions either. And Orgyan Tobgyal was absolutely clear, all those people are samaya breakers with one way tickets to lower realms. 

And he is just as culpable, really. Without DJK visiting places like Rigpa, knowing what is going on, Sogyal would never have been so successful. Yes, I understand a valid argument can be made that there are earnest and sincere people in this place who deserve to receive teachings, etc. Much of the Tibetan Buddhist establishment in exile is somewhat culpable in the Sogyal Frankenstein. They permitted and abetted this situation, and did not shut him down in the 90's when he should have been shut down. But the attraction of devoted students, incense, beautiful statues, nice donations which can be used for your monastery and shedra back in India, and so on are powerful fumes which overcome one easily, even if you do not take a penny for yourself.

Cessation is not annihilation. Analytical cessation is the absence of the arising of afflictions which continued birth in samsara due supermundane insight on the path of seeing and meditation. Nonanalytical cessation is is simple absence of a cause for arising, like a burnt seed.

The point is that the student in question has no samaya to break. The student faces only the consequence of having had a fraud as a teacher. That can be truly devastating, as I have personally observed in the fallout resulting from the unethical financial and sexual conduct of the one unqualified teacher I had the displeasure of knowing. And no, I am not going to say who this teacher is.

She does not have an alternative. This is why buying her services is exploitation. She is selling her body, placing herself at risk of pregnancy, beatings, sexually transmitted diseases, and even murder. If you want to give a prostitute her fee without using her services, this is dāna. It may not be the most intelligent dāna, but at least you are not using her to masturbate.

Buddhadharma generally expresses itself by adapting to the needs of the people who are to be befitted by it. This does not mean there are not fractious and difficult challenges ahead, especially for Tibetan reactionary conservatives who imagine that the Dharma is going to be destroyed as it slowly adjusts itself to the needs of western liberals, whom it primarily serves in the West. 

The question that must be raised is whether a Dharma culture that includes liberal, anti-patriarchal, democratic values is truly all that bad. To read some of DKJ's posts, this seems to be worse than have boiling gold poured down one's throat. How is it that the Dharma is so inflexible, so intellectually moribund, that it cannot meet the needs of a given client population? Well, I do not believe for one second that Dharma is that inflexible and intellectually moribund.

The fact is that there are more women in the Dharma in the West than there are men. This is undoubtedly one reason why Shenphen Rinpoche raised four women to be lamas. He has more female students than male students. 

As to upholding the idea of genderlessness— it is true that the mind has no gender. It is equally true that our physical gender is an expression of a) our afflictive patterning and b) our mother's conduct in the womb. The point is not be gender blind, this is like the fantasy that the USA is racially blind. It isn't. We still have deal with the fact that after forty years of the women's movement, women still earn on average $0.78 to every $1.00 than a man earns. We live in a society with deep issues with both gender and race. Hoping to smooth it alway with gender blindness is just not going to work.

The difference is that when I buy a homeless person's newsletter, I am not exploiting them. When I use the services of a prostitute, I am.

Basically, what happens when unethical teachers breach their commitments with their students is that the establishment resorts to tribal punishment memes. This is what Orgyen Tobgyal did when he accused the students at Rigpa of breaking their samaya. 

It is understandable, albeit wrong-headed. It is like claiming, "Well, you took Ramsey Bolton as your guru, and now you are just screwed—&nbsp;your bad."

Tantric commitments are for encouraging harmony in a Vajrayāna Sangha, and the guru is the head of that Sangha. But when a guru's unethical actions threaten that Sangha itself, there is really something for the students to to say and something for them to, and they should resist misguided traditionalists who go all Tilopa on them.

Since prostitution is rooted in patriarchy, it is probable that it will never be nonexploitative, since the economy that produces prostitutes is inherently exploitative. In a nonpatriarchal economy prostitution will not exist even though there may be sex workers of various kinds.

It is summed up in this old Tibetan saying, "Every valley has a different language; every lama has a different Dharma."

Kirt thinks that broad commonalties, largely based in the Kadampa tradition, between the four schools counts for an orthodoxy, or that the goal of all schools is to liberated sentient beings (it is true they all give lip service to this idea). 

But we all know that Tibetan culture is extremely brutal to animals (hence Patrul's' long diatribes about meat eating, agriculture practices, shearing of sheep and so on), and we also know that Tibetans were extremely brutal to each other. The aristocrats in Tibet oppressed the shit out of their subjects, all the while mouthing pretty mores about compassion, bodhicitta, and so on. I certainly do not mean to suggest, by the way that Western Capitalist culture is a vast improvement. In 1850 there were 3,204,313 slaves in bondage in the USA. 

Quite frankly, so called "orthodoxy" in Tibetan Buddhism merely serves the class interests of the religious caste in Tibetan society. 

This is not to say that Tibetan Buddhism has not produced thousands of awakened people, because it has —&nbsp;but as far as I can tell, most of these people were on the margins, like Milarepa, not connected with institutional Buddhism in Tibet, for the most part.

He did indeed discuss this, which I took pains to point out. 

However, he still lays blame on the students who have picked a faulty guru and he still insists that if such students criticize that guru or perceives the guru as disqualified or at fault, they have broken samaya with that guru, even if in the end it is the guru's own damn fault because that guru himself broke samaya with his or students, subjecting those students to abuse —&nbsp;physical, sexual, financial, or emotional. 

I can understand why people like Dzongsar, who have literally thousands of vajra disciples, might be anxious about the issue of samayas. You have to have a titanium stomach to bear all that broken samaya.

There are a lot of samaya heroes out there who arrogantly proclaim that that "Vajrayāna isn't for pussies." Vajrayāna machismo primarily injures woman—&nbsp;  it really does need to end. 

Another glaring hole in his presentation was there was no mention of patriarchy, the unequal status of woman in the Dharma, sexist attitudes towards woman that is rampant in Vajrayāna circles (the dakini/whore complex), Tibetan privilege (yes, it is a problem), and so on.

It is my opinion that if a qualified guru wishes to create samaya bonds with people who are a) tuning in over the internet or b) are present in the room, that is their prerogative. I see no reason at all why refuge ceremonies, monastic ordinations, bodhisattva vow rites, and so on as well as full abhishekas cannot be conferred online. The only difference I see is whether or not some guru feels comfortable with doing so or not. If they feel comfortable with it, that is fine with me and I will respect that their students received the transmission they say they received. Obviously gurus who are not comfortable with giving transmissions and empowerments online will not be online for that reason.

This is with respect to breaking the samayas of the body, from chapter 10 of the Rig pa rang shar:

Both master and disciple are born in the hell of great wailing.

If the disciple breaks samaya, there is a method of purification.
recite the vast discourses
and turn the vast wheel of the ganacakra.
It is also said that one should completely purify the three wheels.

It also gives warning signs that one has broken samaya:

These are the warning signs of broken samaya:
various misfortunes arise,
diseases are rampant and harmful, 
various contagious diseases occur, 
and there are also provocations and misguiders. 
If one is killed, one becomes a hell being. 
One’s eyes cannot see form. 
One cannot hear and one’s work cannot be done.
Leprosy and blistering diseases arise. 
Thieves and royal punishments occur. 
One contracts contagious diseases others do not get. 
One’s sons and daughters die. 
The whole country arises as one’s enemy.
One’s activities become completely pointless. 
When such warning signs arise, 
recite a confession as previously explained. 
If confessions are recited, then these signs will be successfully averted.

It means you have to know what you are doing. You have to understand the Dharma. You have to examine the teacher. You have to understand the commitments you are taking on. For example, if you do not understand the commitments you are taking, you don't have samaya at all. It is really that simple. 

If you do understand the commitments, you do know what you are doing, and so on, a teacher's conduct has to be pretty outrageously abusive before you can legitimately say, this teacher has broken samaya and now my commitment to him or her is null and void. If he or she likes fancy cars, too bad; if they like expensive food and wine; too bad. If they have a penchant for gold and silver, and insist that their students pay outrageous fees for teachings, too bad. If they like having multiple partners and are up front about it, too bad. If they are gay, too bad. If they are trans, too bad. 

But if they systematically abuse their power, or are dishonest, or are physically and/or sexually abusive, well, then one might have a case that this teacher is bad news. Even here, it is best to just leave their company and move on. However, sometimes it is bad enough to warrant a public outing. In this case, don't worry about your samaya, your obligation to sentient beings is more important.

However, promising infernal consequences if someone busts a teacher purporting to teach Vajrayāna and give Vajrayāna teachings when they behave in a manner which proves they are not at all qualified to care for students is fundamentalism of the worst kind.

Most of the piece was self-indulgent babble. The essence of the bullshit in this piece is that Dzongsar blames students for rejecting and abandoning deluded gurus when those students find out about the delusion of their deluded guru. It is not fair, it is not rational, and it is pure superstition to imagine that attending a ritual, no matter how profound and meaningful when administered by a realized person to a group of well prepared students, creates an irreversible bond when administered by foolish and deluded teachers. No one imagines that attending a monastic ordination lead by a madman would have any force at all. Such thinking represents the worst example of the fetter of attachment to rules and rituals. Indeed, this whole idea comes from such fettered thinking. 

Why should we imagine that empowerments administered to poorly educated Western Dharma students by deluded fools who imagine themselves gurus, whether Tibetan or any other ethnicity, would have any binding power via samaya other than through accepting an irrational interpretation of how rites that impart Vajrayāna vows actually function? Most people have no idea what is happening when they attend empowerments. They do not understand the visualizations as they happen, and so on. Even if the gurus in question are realized, if the student does not understand what is going on, no samaya is transmitted. 

I would suggest, honestly, that there are probably few people who actually have samaya at all among so called Vajrayāna students——&nbsp;by and large because they have no idea what is happening during empowerments, direct introductions, and so on. There is no magic bond created by an empowerment, none whatsoever. The only true bond or samaya we have is our understanding of Dharma, how deep it goes, and our appreciation of the teacher and community within which this blossoms. 

The other samayas are relative. But it is the relative ones that receive all the attention. Even in terms of relative samaya, samaya is something that gradually builds, matures, and becomes deeper as the student matures in their understanding of profound Secret Mantra. 

I would suggest also that there are very few gurus alive today who can actually impart samayas, since they have not realized the meaning of the teachings they are imparting. I will discuss this in the conclusion. 

When we think about debacles like Rikpa (as it presently exists), we should not even be discussing the issue of breaking samaya. First of all it is bad for the students. It demoralizes them. Secondly, we are not sure that they have samaya from Sogyal. It has yet to be determined that he ever was a qualified teacher. If he was never a qualified teacher, they never received samaya. When we read comments such as the one below it is seem very questionable whether Sogyal is a qualified teacher, (the part of the article which is not bullshit, apart from just a little):

I know a little about Sogyal Rinpoche because I have visited several Rigpa centres and have witnessed the Rigpa set-up first hand. To be frank, I didn’t see enough evidence to convince me that the appropriate warnings had been given, or that adequate foundations had been laid, or that the fundamental teachings were properly given. On several occasions it seemed to me that some of the students had been Christians until perhaps the day before they attended the teaching, then suddenly, 24-hours later, they were hearing about guru devotion, receiving pointing out instructions and practising Guru Yoga – it was as extreme as that.

If that’s how it happened – if no proper warnings and no fundamental training were given prior to the Vajrayana teachings¬ ¬– then Sogyal Rinpoche is even more in the wrong than his critical students. Why? Because it is his responsibility to prepare the ground in accordance with the Vajrayana’s prescribed and well-established foundation teachings and practice. There is no question that the person with the greater knowledge, power and therefore responsibility is also more culpable when those obligations are not fulfilled.

If Sogyal is in the wrong, and did not prepare his students properly, this automatically means he is an unqualified teacher and his students have no samaya with him at all, apart from as a Vajra brother. If Sogyal is in the wrong, it is axiomatic that his critical students are not in the wrong at all, from a samaya point of view, and thus this line is bullshit because they have no samaya with him. 

Dzongsar also says this, which is 2% bullshit, 96% ok, and 2% requires a little more comment. Ok part in green; bullshit part in red, other part in orange:

If the teacher and student have reached a genuine understanding about the path being practised, and if all the necessary and appropriate foundations have been laid and a clear idea of possible consequences conveyed, but the student still has a wrong view and acts on it by slandering and criticizing the teacher, then, according to tantra, that student will face grave and unimaginable consequences. 

But the same also applies to the teacher. In fact, if the teacher hasn’t laid the proper foundations, if the teacher takes advantage of a student physically, emotionally or financially, and if the teacher gives the highest yoga tantric teachings to those who have not established a proper foundation and as a result an immature student breaks the most fundamental root samayas, then the teacher will also suffer extremely grave consequences – consequences even more serious and terrible than those faced by the student.

With respect to the section marked in orange: the serious and terrible consequences to a student that has been taken advantage of by a guru or teacher is that their trust in Dharma might be damaged for some time in this life or even multiple lifetimes, and they may suffering secret obstacles which prevent them from applying the Dharma. This is what renders the broken samaya of a teacher irreparable. 

In short, people should consult the Rigpa Rangshar's chapter on samaya and cease laying blame on blameless students who have the misfortune of choosing mad guides. It not fair, it is not just, it is not right, it is not rational, and should not be accepted regardless of what the traditions seems to say on the matter because to take all this literally is merely an expression of the fetter of attachment to rules and rituals. What do I mean by "literally?" By "literal" I mean that empowerments given by gurus who are not truly realized have very little force. They have very little force to produce realization in their disciples, for many, many reasons. Likewise, they also have very little power to impart any real samaya. 

The reasons why we see so much broken samaya today is not the fault of students, it is the fault of too many unrealized teachers giving empowerments which they are not qualified to give in the first place. 

Oh, and BTW, bringing up Naropa and Tilopa, etc. is bullshit. Please stop doing it. The twelves trials are just stories, didactic stories to show what a huge egotist Naropa was. They doubtless have some basis, but they are exaggerated way beyond anything anyone can reasonably accept as anything other than Indian/Tibetan dramatic hyperbole.

Nirvana is the cessation of afflictions, and parinirvana is cessation of birth. The latter is an extreme because if buddhas cease in fact they cannot directly benefit anyone. Mahāyāna nirvana is called "non-abiding." This means though in one's continuum afflictions for rebirth in samsara has ceased, upon attaining buddhahood one continues to benefit sentient beings directly until samsara is emptied. 

On the other hand, the Dzogchen view is stated succinctly by Mañjuśrīmitra:

Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion. 

Mipham comments on this line:

Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparition, while a false appearance, appears to the deluded, similar to an illusion. 

As for your second question, it is exactly the same as the example of a liquid substance that appears differently for the being of the six realms.

This does not mean that. It is similar to a  suuta in the Sutta Nipata where it is pointed out by the Buddha that one cannot speak of the nonexistence of an arhat who has passed away because there is no existence by which his nonexistence may be described. 

Similarly, one cannot speak of the nonexistence of a given thing which has ceased because there is no given thing there to talk about. Fundamentaly, cessation is the absence of a cause, either through insight, or naturally, like a burnt seed. We cannot speak properly of the nonexistence of a shoot from a burnt seed because such a thing never existed from the start. All we can say is "That seed will not germinate." Likewise, of an arhat one can only say, "He or she will not be born."

By declaring there is an ultimate, atemporal, unsupported, unfabricated, unmanifest, ineffable and self-arising, you have already slipped off the other side of the horse into eternalism. 

Neither the atemporal, unsupported, unfabricated, unmanifest, ineffable and self-arising nor the temporal, supported, fabricated, manifest, effable and arising from another can be established in any way. When one understands that nothing can be established in any of the four extremes in anyway whatsoever outside of conventions, then one has a slight glimpse of the wisdom of the Buddha. As long as one insists there is an  atemporal, unsupported, unfabricated, unmanifest, ineffable and self-arising in contrast to the the temporal, supported, fabricated, manifest, effable and arising from another one has not escaped from any extreme at all. One is still trapped in the two extremes of permanence (the atemporal, unsupported, unfabricated, unmanifest, ineffable and self-arising) and annihilation (the temporal, supported, fabricated, manifest, effable and arising from another). I am surprised that do not easily see the flaw in your reasoning. 

In short, there is no independent ultimate, or nirvana, etc., other than in the mistaken view of Hinayāna tenets.

You claim that when statement points to an illusion, if there is no ultimate basis with which to contrast an illusion the statement is rendered false? This is poor reasoning. 

Statements are conventions and do not require any ultimate basis in order to accepted conventionally, i.e., nonanalytically. Not does analysis of conventions such as arising require some ultimate basis in order to ascertain they are false. Conventions can be examined and found false without any reference at all to any ultimate basis. To suggest otherwise is fall prey to the kind of pathological, realist substantialism the Buddha's Dharma is meant to cure. 

I repeat, conventions require no ultimate basis in order to be conventionally true. 

In worldly conventional perception things appear to arise from causes and conditions. MMK 1:1

No thing arises at any time, anywhere
from itself, from other than itself, or without a cause. 

When analyzed it is found there are no causes and no conditions —&nbsp;this analysis forms the entire body of the rest of the MMK -- arising from conditions is merely a convention and when investigated no arising can be found at all (and thus no abiding or perishing either). 

You must have real difficulties reading Nāgārjuna:

Since arising, abiding, and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established. 
Since the conditioned is never established, how can the unconditioned ever be established?

In light of the above, I think you may wish to retract your hasty and erroneous critique,

It is also does not have anything to do with the Tibetan thing either. 

For example, there is a famous traditional story. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, one of the few famous Tibetan who really attained buddhahood, was pestered by some monks who were unhappy with the newly recognized tulku for their monastery, so they pestered him with their doubts. 

After growing a little impatient with them, he said, "Let's go see your lama." 

He led to them to the cattle yard, and called out the recently deceased lama's name. A young bull calf trotted over. "There" Khyentse said, "This is your lama."

The Tibetan penchant for devotional hyperbole is hard for westerners to deal with. We tend to take everything so literally.

This is a huge misconception that has arisen from a mistaken Chinese translation of the term "sprul sku" as "living buddha." 

There are several kinds of tulkus. The kind of tulku we mostly encounter are "blessed" tulkus. The process of enthroning them is virtually identical with consecrating a buddha statue. We find a small boy, with proper signs, maybe they even correctly pick out some of the items of their predecessor. With this done, they are blessed as the incarnation of their predecessor and the rest is history. The process of identifying candidates is an art, not a science, and sometimes great political turmoil arises because of disagreements among senior monastics over who is the "right" choice. 

The kind of tulku who is a living buddha is generally a self-proclaimed incarnation, not a recognized incarnation. 

Also, the modern Tibetan Buddhist establishment, recognizing the kind of misunderstandings that arise from the use of the term tulku for reincarnations has taken to calling them yang srid, rebirths, rather than tulkus.

Though one can find descriptions of the nature of mind in sūtras, the methods of introducing it do not exist in sūtras. One must find a teacher who has the intimate instructions. 

Further, introduction to the nature of the mind is not confined to Dzogchen masters, but it is confined to Vajrayāna. Even here, such introductions as they may be found in Vajrayāna empowerments tend to be overly brief, ritualized, cryptic and obscure.

Though you may find methods of introduction described in some books, for example, some lengthy Mahāmudra manuals come to mind, they must be received from a teacher who has realized the meaning of such instructions in themselves because such methods are experiential, not intellectual. 

If someone wishes experiential training in the nature of the mind, one should find an old master who has done many years of retreat and who has also guided many students personally. One must do whatever it is he or she might command. In general, one will not be able to receive such teachings from famous teachers, with a very, very, short list of exceptions.

People do not even know they should inquire. 

Many people seek inwardly for answers too, but not recognizing the right questions to ask, they come up with many incorrect answers.

If you want to know the secret guru, first you must discover the inner guru; and to discover that inner guru, a realized outer guru is indispensable.  

People have a very huge misconception about gurus, particularly in Dzogchen teachings. No guru is going to hand you awakening in their hand, or pick out the perfect yidam for you to practice, or give you a tailor made path to buddhahood. But they can transmit their own knowledge of the teachings, and help you encounter your own state directly. A realized guru is indispensable in this case. In Dzogchen and Mahāmūdra, an unrealized guru, however, is a serial killer of disciples. An unrealized guru can set one back many lifetimes. An unrealized guru breaks their own samaya the minute they open their mouths.

There is no living tradition of the sTon mun (Chan) tradition which has survived in Tibet, though perhaps there is a vestigal remnant of it in the Kagyu Mahāmudra tradition. 

However, the clearest explanation of these traditions as they existed in Tibet may be found in the The Lamp of the Eye of Dhyāna by Nubchen Sangye Yeshe. Here it is clearly explained with respect to sūtrayāna systems, the Chan tradition's view and practice is much superior to the Indian system of view and practice brought to Tibet as presented to the Tibetans by Kamalashila. Without this background, I am afraid Tibetan Zen will be rather obtuse. 

As evidenced by the preservation of a debate in an 11th century text by Mañjusȓīkirti, there was a serious debate in the mid 8th century between Indian exponents of the tradition we now term "The Great Perfection" (Śrī Singha being mentioned by name) and a more gradualist style of Vajrayāna which came to be the normative position. However, echoes of the earlier Indian nongradual tradition may be found in some of the Mahāmudra dohas, especially those of Saraha. Klaus Dieter Mathis has done some remarkable work in this area.

Well, you can think whatever you like, but the commentarial tradition is pretty clear on what this greatness means. Rongzom states:

Even this demonstration of “buddhahood” is either a faultless quality which exists or does not exist as such a characteristic. Either everything is buddhahood or is everything free from even the nominal designation “buddhahood.”


And:

To determine the greatness of the total non-existence of buddhahood, if buddhahood and non-buddhahood are non-dual, why is one seeking? Determine there is nothing to seek. The yogins in whom such a meaning is present effortlessly abide on the undifferentiated stage of Samantabhadra. The undifferentiated stage of Samantabhadra is universal stage of all Buddhas. Whatever the meaning of Dzogchen might be, that is it.

The verb here is med pa, nonexistence; sangs rgyas is a noun.

It is better to rely directly on sutras like the Prajñāpāramita which states:

Even the unshared Dharmas of a buddha are like a dream, like an illusion.

Or for example, the Ārya-bhadramāyākāra-vyākaraṇa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states

Just as fire spreads outward
in a field with butter or oil,
likewise, Bhadra's illusions
definitely show the Buddha to be an illusion.  

And the Ārya-caturdāraka-samādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

In the same way, all conditioned things
are likewise illusory, without essence; 
the buddhas and śrāvakas too
are not different, are just the same. 

And since you like Mañjuśrimitra, he states in his Meditation on Bodhicitta:

Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion.

Personally, I think what is needed is a broad merging of Deep Ecology and Social Ecology/Libertarian Municipalism. Deep ecology, or rather Naess' ecosophy model specifically, provides the necessary philosophical framework needed for sustaining a broad, intellectually diverse, radical ecology movement; Bookchin's writings show a way out of the patriarchal social systems that have landed us in this mess to begin with. 

The difficulty with Naess's writing is that they are not obviously systematic, and really require a lot of thought. If I fault Bookchin for anything, it is his insistence that we first must create a nonhierarchical society, and then deal with the issue of the environment —&nbsp;if only we had so much time! However, I think we can create nonhierarchical communities in an effort to meet his challenge. At the same time however, we must support Al Gore, McKibben, David Graber, and so on. At this point I am a bit loathe to lend my support the Green Party in the US, because they run a top down ship, and there is virtually no room for new leadership. Jill Stein also began to sound like crazy person during the election, repeating Russian agitprop taken from pro-Russian "anti-Atlantacist" right wing nutjobs like Richard Spencer and other Alt-right lunatics.

In short, I argue ecosocialists such as Sarkar have in no way transcended their Marxist roots, that they insist on an economic dictatorships which in the end will only escalate into the kind of situation we had in Soviet Union, where, as McLaughlin writes, "Ecology was also seen as reactionary because it cast doubt on the view that socialism could and should transform nature." (pg. 52, Regarding Nature). 

Anotehr problem is that most people, like Greg for example, take Deep Ecology as interpreted by David Forman to truly representative of Deep Ecology in toto. It is not.

No. But it is a view grounded in a biocentric spiritual impulse, something that makes many Social Ecologists uneasy, and which they too easily conflate with romanticism. Actually, Deep Ecology is very inclusive of other ecological movements, as Naess says, "The Front is long." 

The main point is that we need to transition to a steady state world economy, i.e., a no growth economy. Neither Capitalism nor Socialism can accommodate this.

It depends on how close to a Sakya, Kagyu or even Gelugpa monastery a given Nyingma scholar was raised. 

These days, via Mipham and Khenpo Zhenga, Nyingma view skews Sakya in formal academic studies. But a lot of Nyingmapas, nevertheless, adhere to Kongtrul's ideas. These rose to great prominence in the late nineteenth century in Eastern Tibet and have influenced many very famous masters such as Dudjom Rinpoche and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, among others. On the other hand, we find masters like Jigme Lingpa, Shabkar, and the Drodrupchens whose outlook on formal academic studies are completely influenced by their proximity to Gelug institutions of higher learning.

But the emptiness of the mind is part of the entity of the mind and not something separate from the mind itself, just as the capacity for the mind to know is also inseparable from the entity of the mind itself.

A nonaffirming negation is the direct negation of something that does not exist at all, in this case, essences. When we negate essence, we are not affirming the existence of anything else.

These ten nonvirtues and there opposite govern the karmic results of all sentient beings, not just human beings. This is why predators have a more difficult time escaping the animal realm than song birds, for example. All actions are either positive, meaning they correspond with ten virtues; neutral, meaning they have no positive or negative intention behind them, or negative. Negative actions are wholly attended by the six afflictive mental factors that all beings in the desire realm who have afflictive minds possess. This is not a "projection." This is how the Buddha taught the principles of karma and its retribution.

The unconditioned cannot be a direct object of the mind. It can only be inferred by the mind. Unconditioned space is an absence of obstruction. It cannot be directly perceived. Cessation is the absence of a cause. It also cannot be perceived directly. Likewise, emptiness— the absence of inherent existenc in your preferred parlance— cannot be directly perceived. All three of these types of unconditioned phenomena (there are no others in Buddhadharma) can only be inferred. 

Therefore, the emptiness meditated upon below the path of seeing is merely a conceptual stand in for actual emptiness. The emptiness meditated above the path of seeing is not an object of the mind, since it is actual emptiness. That meditation is a nonmeditation because it is completely free from all objectification.

Patriarchy is a social system, spread throughout most of the world, that involves the economic and social subjugation by one gender of all other genders. 

Merriam Webster states:

Patriarchy: 1) social organization marked by the supremacy of the father in the clan or family, the legal dependence of wives and children, and the reckoning of descent and inheritance in the male line; broadly: control by men of a disproportionately large share of power

You have also excused womanizing by lamas as culturally acceptable since the status of women is low in Tibetan society, it's just their culture (it isn't actually).

What it will descend to is the myth that Buddhism fell to the Muslim sword. Buddhism indeed fell to the sword, but that was in the late fifth century, and the swords were those of Huns, not Muslims. 

Buddhism and Islam lived side by side for centuries in Central Asia. And by 1200, Buddhists had only two major monasteries in India, the Hindus having taken over or destroyed the rest. The first person who projected Muslim power beyond the Punjab was Mohammed Ghuri (1162-1206), who sacked central India and destroyed 80 temples, all but two were Hindu temples.

The difference between us is that you are using that position to defend male privilege in this respect by placing all responsibility on the women involved in these sad incidents. I find this strange because you seem to think that these women in Dharma centers are in positions of equal privilege with the men who are assaulting them sexually, when normally, for example, I am pretty sure you would not be sympathetic with johns who exploit African women prostitutes in Italy, etc., and would clearly understand the power differentials involved and why the sex trade in these countries was grossly unfair and dangerous for the women.  However, these women in Dharma centers are not in positions of equal privilege, and I have personally witnessed an entire community unravel because the teacher involved was discovered to have been grossly hitting on women, some cases successfully, in every Dharma center he visited, with very negative consequences for everyone involved.

I don't doubt it, and neither do I condone it.  I said that a teacher coming from this cultural mileu will have very different standards to those encountered in some Western countries and this inevitably will lead to conflict.  I fail to see what is so controversial about that.[/quote]

When in Rome, do as the Romans. The onus is on Tibetan teachers to discover what kind of culture they intend to spread Dharma in. If they are not up to changing their views, adapting their teachings to the situation they find in the West, they should just stay home. Most people do not realize that nunneries in India and Tibet are major refuges for women fleeing human trafficking and the sex trade. These women take up vows because they are tired of being sexually exploited. You need to read up on the very real inequality Tibetan and Himalayan women face under Buddhism (among other nations like Thailand). 

When Lamas come to the West, and then begin having sexual relationships with women in their Sanghas, womanizing, getting them pregnant, forcing them to have abortions on the pain of self-exile back to India, refusing to speak with them after they have decided to end the affair, and so on, this is completely wrong and we should not stand for it. 

I personally have no problem with Tibetan Lamas meeting a female student and then having a serious relationship with them where they are accorded personal respect as befits them as human beings. There are some good examples of such partnerships. But women are becoming increasingly suspicious of Tibetan Lamas, rightly so, and this is a problem for the flourishing of the Dharma in the West. 

As to your oft repeated cultural relativism: Tibetan women do not enjoy and they do not like the sexism in their culture. 

Tibetans in general do not like it when Lamas womanize. They consider it vulgar and unseemly. Such lamas do not attract large followings in Tibetan culture in general. The fact that some lamas come to the west and get away with this behavior has more to do with the fact that they were able to get away with it here where they could not possibly get away with this in the tight knit communities in Tibet and the Himalayas, as well as exile communities. Drukpa Kunley's are few in Tibetan culture. Most people cannot be Drukpa Kunley.

It means you have not taken into account that the onus of sexual misconduct in this case is traditionally held to fall on the person with power —&nbsp;that it why it is sexual misconduct to sleep with someone's else spouse, children, the ordained, etc. 

Frankly, the status of women is still very low in Tibetan Buddhism. Tibetan teachers, on the whole, are still very sexist and patriarchal. Patriarchy is not a good thing, and has very negative consequences for women around the world. I suggest you look into the work of Karma Lekshey Tsomo, etc. One of the main terms in Tibetan for women is skyes dman, lower birth. This view is so endemic that the chapters on women's health in the medicine tantras begin:

Because of inferior merit, one obtains the body of a women... female illness in the end become fourteen extra [diseases] for woman because their birth is lower.

Emptiness is the unconditioned nature of things. There are no appearances that are not conditioned and dependently arisen, therefore, there is no need to bracket appearance/emptiness as something distinct from dependent origination/emptiness, they are the same thing. 

Why do we say emptiness is unconditioned? No one made emptiness, no one can increase emptiness, no one can decrease emptiness, no one can destroy emptiness. You might argue, well, what is the emptiness of a thing that has ceased to exist? Does that emptiness exist or not? If the emptiness of a given thing is conditioned, one should be able to describe how it arose. Merely stating that a thing's emptiness arose with the arising of thing itself is not adequate. When a thing perishes there is no need to discuss the nature of a nonexistent. When we examine the meaning of emptiness, we find that emptiness refers to the absence of four extremes of being in phenomena. Since all phenomena are free from four extremes, emptiness is therefore unconditioned.

I appears we are talking about someone who was not "having sex," but rather, apparently abusing his position of power to find sexual partners. This is a serious problem in Tibetan Buddhism. I have heard countless accounts of this kind of thing going on in numerous Sanghas such as the Sakya school, the Nyingma school, and the Kagyu school. Most American women I have discussed this with consider this a real problem, and all have been inappropriately approached on one occasion or another by lamas, monastic and and nonmonastic. 

Woman do not expect to be hit on when they seek religious guidance. When they are, there are a variety of responses, most of them negative.

In Tibetan, ojas is translated a mdangs. This fluid is discussed in the four medicine tantras, specifically in the explanatory tantra, in the chapter on physiology, chapter 5:. 

The metabolic heat of each individual tissue ripens the extract. The extract travels the path of the liver in nine channels that draw the extract from the stomach, changing into blood in the location of the liver; flesh from blood; from flesh changing into fat; from fat changing into bone; from bone changing into marrow; from marrow changing into semen (khu ba, śukra).

Their impure part is the stomach phlegm, bile, sebum, grease, teeth and nails, oil of the pores and the anus, reproductive fluid (sa bon). 

The final state of the semen tissue (khu ba khams, śukra dhātu) is the supreme life-sustaining fluid (mdangs, ojas), located in the heart, pervading the entire body, and causes longevity, radiance, and brilliance.

Emptiness is not really an object, it is the state of things. In sutra, emptiness is arrived at inferentially. The so called "direct perception of emptiness" is in every respect the absence of the perception of substantiality in/of things. This absence of perception is in fact an inference below the path of seeing in sūtra as well as Dzogchen, Mahāmudra, and so on. 

The difference lies in whether or not the nature of the mind is directly pointed out. In sūtra it is not, and in Vajrayāna it is — gradually, in the case of Mahāmudra, or all at once, as in the case of Dzogchen.

If it is just a matter of seeking sexual partners, everyone involved presumably is a consenting adult. Whether it is liberating activity or just sex is not something we actually have the capacity to perceive with our limited samsaric vision. If Sogyal was forcing his women student to have abortions after he impregnated them, for example, then this would be entirely different, of course.  Therefore, this is none of our business, in absence of other information. 

Physical assualt is a criminal act, either a misdemeanor or a felony depending on how severe the resulting harm. A punch in the stomach is likely a misdemeanor unless there is some damage to an organ.  However, the proper forum adjudicating this is the courts, not DW. Hence my observation that Sogyal has become the OJ of Tibetan Buddhism.

It is a delicate subject and should be treated with care. Simply finding that you do not like a guru after all, and feel he or she is not being super nice to oneself and meeting one's expectations is not a grounds for "outing" a guru. In our culture we are overly sensitive about being respected. If you wanted to sleep with your guru, and then found out they have other partners, that is your problem. If on the other hand you or someone you know are physically damaged by a teacher, sexually assaulted/raped, or subjected to clear psychological abuse, this may be sufficient grounds for exposing a teacher. 

A lot of so called "guru abuse" is a co-created problem where students lose their perspective and feed a guru's ego, the latter in turn begin to feel invincible, and there is kind of snowball effect of ego inflation: the student feels their master is enlightened, the master begins to believe student mythology, and then the master loses perspective. In this case, students really need to reflect on their own role in their own "abuse" in terms of how much they were involved in inflating their master's ego in order to inflate their own. In short, it may be a practice to view our guru as enlightened, but we really should not keep telling them that over and over again. If our guru is truly realized, it will be evident when they die. Until then, it is best to maintain a balanced perspective and keep good boundaries. 

If our guru is a truly harmful being, it is they who are breaking samaya and not we. They cannot repair samaya they break with their students. We can always repair our samaya with respect to all our teachers. 

It is very perilous to be a guru. It is a great responsibility. And, it is the case that sometimes flawed gurus generate a great deal of benefit for the majority of their students, at the expense of a few. 

With respect to the Sogyal affair, I have no personal opinion about the matter which I choose to share, apart from my comment about his letter. I was not there, I did not see what happened, and in this country, America, accusations are not sufficient proof to convict, despite movies, testimonies, and so on. I am afraid that Sogyal is now something like the OJ Simpson of Tibetan Buddhism, his letter is the white bronco, and one's opinion of his guilt or innocence depending on which side of the ethnic/traditionalist divide you stand. 

One thing to bear in mind is that Sogyal has had a huge hand in introducing thousands of western students to luminaries like Dilgo Khyentse and so on, whom they otherwise may have never met or would have had great difficulty receiving teachings from. His book, whether personally authored or ghostwritten, has been a major introduction to Tibetan Buddhism for hundreds of thousands of people. Like any person living in a democracy, he deserves the right to a fair trial, not the incessant sniping on the internet to which he has been subjected for decades. If someone has a criminal or civil complaint, they should file it in the French Courts. Otherwise, this is all hearsay, and hearsay bears no legal weight whatsoever. If he is not doing anything for which he may held criminally or civilly liable, one may find his lifestyle and choices distasteful and disturbing, but it is also none of one's business. One is not obligated to participate in his Sangha.

For their own practice of the path, bodhisattvas are obliged to abandon the ten nonvirtuous deeds, eating meat and so on. Therefore, the bodhisattva path is a renunciate path in general.

Relying on the definitive meaning in no way contradicts the path of renunciation which is clearly taught as the principle expedient means in Mahāyāna. To insist that it does means abandoning the relative in favor of the ultimate. Buddha taught two truths; the one of worldly convention, and the ultimate truth. These two truths are not in contradiction. Someone who does not understand that common Mahāyāna is a path of renunciation does not understand the meaning of the two truths.

It is called connate ignorance in other teachings than Dzogchen because sentient beings do not recognize the nature of their own minds, inseparable clarity and emptiness. The way the Sakypas frame this, for example, is because the emptiness of the mind is not recognized, this causes nirvana. Because the clarity of the mind is not recognized, this causes samsara. Because their inseparability is not recognized, this is the source of the misperception of self. So, it is not simply a matter of lacking insight into emptiness alone. It is a matter of not recognizing the nature of the mind in its totality. The Dzogchen account, given above, is very different. The Sakya theory has another interesting twist—&nbsp;they identify tathāgatagarbha as the inseparability aspect of inseparable clarity and emptiness because clarity and emptiness are themselves extremes to be avoided.

In Dzogchen teachings, when the potential of consciousness manifests as its own display, if that display is not recognized as its own state, this is called "the connate ignorance." It is called connate (lhan gcig skyes) because it arises in the presence of a similitude of subject and object perception, i.e. it is the the ignorance that arises with the display. Even Samantabhadra experiences this ignorance. 

When the perceived display is reified as other, self-grasping ensues immediately. This reification following nonrecognition is called "the imputing ignorance." Following this the twelve limbs of dependent origination begin and there is a bifurcation between samsara and nirvana, often described as "samsara and nirvana turning their backs on one another."

There is a third ignorance, which exists prior to these two, called "the ignorance identical with the cause." This simply means that prior to the potential of consciousness arising as a display, consciousness is unaware of itself.

You are missing the point: all religions recognize that suffering exists, that is has a cause, and it can cease. They merely disagree about the means. In that case then, what is unique about Buddha's teachings? Certainly not the first three truths. Moreover, every religion has their idea of right view, etc. So the eightfold path, arguably, is not so unique either. So we are left with the question: what doctrine is absolutely unique to Buddhadharma? That, I would argue, and have for many years, is dependent origination and its corollary, emptiness free from extremes. Moreover, the Buddha did not invent this idea. This has been the consistent teaching of all the Buddhas of past, is the teaching of the Buddha of the presence, and will be the teaching of all Buddhas of the future.

This diagnostic idea is common to all religions: there is a problem, the problem has a cause, the problem can be resolved because there is a method to solve that problem. There is no need to enshrine common sense as a religious dogma. 

There are more important principles deserving of consideration in Buddhadharma, notably, dependent origination. As the Buddha said, "Whoever sees dependent origination sees the Dharma. Whoever sees the Dharma sees me." When Nāgārjuna set out to correct Hinayāna deviations from the Buddha's true message, he did not focus on the 4NT, his refrain again and again was that one needed to understand what "arising from conditions" really meant and how understanding the Buddha's actual message undermined all substantialist misunderstandings of what the Buddha taught. Elevating the 4NT bears the error of promoting a prescriptive understanding of Buddhadharma when there are more important principles to understand.

Within non-afflictive ignorance there are also two kinds: the the ignorance of the absence of omniscience, for example, in Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas, and the knowledge obscuration from which innate self-grasping arises, which in turn is the cause for the three poisons. This knowledge obscuration is only eradicated in full buddhahood.

That is a good question, and one I am not prepared to answer for them. All I can tell you is what I have found in classical literature on the subject.

And of course, I have no idea if any present day Longde practitioners are going to attain rainbow body either, even though ChNN's revival of Longde in Longsal is a very important development. All we can expect, as practitioners of recent terma cycles, is that the samayas in these lineages are pure and thus the teachings will be very, very effective for their practitioners.

The 16 moments of the HInayāna path of seeing are not shared with Mahāyāna at all.

Moreover, the Abhisamayālaṃkara that for Mahāyanis the truth of the path is the six perfections and not the 8FP.

With respect to this, Kunzang Dorje (1130-?), the author of the Vajra Bridge Longed commentary, was relating the fact that his teacher, Dzeng Dharmabodhi (1052-1168) was a direct disciple of Phadampa Sanggye. Dzeng met Phadampa when he was eighteen, and spent a year and a half with him. With respect to the surprising amount of material in Zhi byed, Kunzang Dorje stated it was impossible for Padampa to have actually said that much since he primarily taught with symbols and did not chatter very much with people, or give teachings with many words. With respect to that, Kunzang Dorje states. "All Dharmas are weakened through popularity," meaning the more popular a teaching is and the more widespread it becomes, the weaker its benefit.

No one is perfectly enlightened by themselves. If you read carefully, you will understand that the Buddha (Gautama) states very clearly that when he was under the bodhitree, he rediscovered the principle of dependent origination through recalling all of his past lives, which necessarily means he recalled teachings he had received from previous buddhas. We know this is the case from the sheer number of times he recounts anecdotes from when he was a disciple of other buddhas. 

Now then, Samantabhadra, of whom Śākyamuni is an emanation, was also an ordinary person, who received teachings, became a buddha as a result, and manifested in this eon as the adibuddha, aka first buddha.

The path offered by the 4NT are specific to Hinayāna teachings. It is not a path for Mahāyāna. In particular, they are not the path that is followed at all in Vajrayāna, since the 4NT offer a path of renunciation.

The effort to avoid the ripening of suffering does not need to be grounded in belief. It can be grounded in simple, empirical observation. The latter is more useful in the avoidance of suffering than the former. 

For example, one can believe one has discovered the nature of the mind, but without a guru to confirm whether or not one has made this discovery, you will just be in a state of belief without knowledge.

I doubt you will find that all Buddhas teach 4NT and 8FP. 

For example, there is a verse in the Vinaya that is more likely to be the core teaching of all Buddhas:


Abandon non-virtue. 
Cultivate virtue. 
Observe one's mind.
This is the teaching of the Buddhas. 


I still would not call this the original Buddhism. Buddhas do not teach according to some plan. Buddhas teach according to the needs of sentient beings. For example, the first buddha of this eon taught Dzogchen, not the 4NT and 8FP. But somehow, I do not think you are likely to accept this. Based on the latter fact, claiming there is some original Buddhism is basically just a faith-based claim, not grounded in facts.

This is true not only with respect to Zen, but all forms of Buddhadharma. There are three wisdoms: hearing, reflection, and meditation. The last I checked, reading was not one of those wisdoms. Thus, to receive Buddhadharma, one must find a teacher and here the Dharma from that person. 

Without hearing the Dharma, there is no possibility of reflection; without reflecting on the Dharma, there is no possibility it can be meditated upon.

One, you are now conflating Nāgārjuna's point of view, who never heard of "Dzogchen," with Dzogchen teachings.

With respect to the latter, the term "basis" refers to something one has not realized. It does not refer to an entity as such. The thog ma gzhi, the original basis, the mind-essence, is the basis of the recognition or nonrecognition of the nature of one's consciousness. If one reifies this as a substratum, one winds up in Advaita land.

It is commonly misunderstood that when one says "all the dharmas of samsara and nirvana" this refers to entities out there in the world. It does not. It refers to one's own aggregates, sense bases, and elements. "All phenomena" means the one aggregate, the material aggregate with its external objects made of the four elements; one sense base refers to the sense base of the mind; and elements refers to the dharmadhātu which contains all the mental factors and unconditioned phenomena.

Thus, when one does not recognize the basis for what it is, one reifies the five lights of one's own pristine consciousness as the five elements; at the same time oneself is doing this, so are infinite myriads of other sentient beings. Shabkar for example, uses the example of how a women who meditated on herself as a tigress terrified a small village in order to show that our own mental projections can generate appearances for others and vice versa:

When a devaputra asked the Buddha:
"Who made Meru, the sun and the moon, and so on?"
The Buddha said:
"There is no other creator here.
The attachment of the traces of one’s conceptuality
imputes them, grasps them and then they appear in that way.
Everything is created by one’s mind."
When the devaputra asked the Buddha again:
"How can the attachment of my concepts
make the hardness and stability of
Meru, the sun and moon, and so on?"
The Buddha said:
"In Varanasi, an old woman
meditated her own body as a tiger.
Since the villagers saw her
as a tiger, they evacuated the village.
If one is able to appear like that for a little while,
if one cultivates mental traces for beginningless lifetimes,
one will be able to appear like this for a year."
Therefore, everything is created by the mind.

The Rig pa rang shar states:

If someone does not dwell in words and does not dwell in names,
that is Prajñāpāramitā,
the transcendent state of buddhahood itself.

And:

Migrating beings are led with the noose of the method
through concrete objects to wisdom. 
Therefore it is the Prajñāpāramita. 
The vast dhātu of Samantabhadra
arises in the dharmatā of unceasing play. 
The dhātu of wisdom, the transcendent state, 
lacks attachment, the nature of grasping. 
Since it is nonconceptual, it is beyond speech and thought.
For example, like a magic display in the sky,
it is said to be free from the Dharma of expression.

Thus we can see that Prajñāpāramita and Great Perfection have equivalent meanings. 

The Union of the Sun and Moon Tantra, source of Song of the Vajra, states:

Someone who has not settled into concentration
will settle naturally with this. 
When the yogin is lethargic,
when revitalized by this, samadhi is good;
it seals one’s mind with bliss,
joined with the state of mahāmudra;
one can enter into all of the guru’s intimate instructions;
emptiness is also supported on the continuum;
Perceptions are liberated in their own place;
mental entities are purified. 
Therefore, sing the song of the vajra
and always do the vajra dance.

Therefore, one can understand that Mahāmudra is nothing other than the state of Dzogchen.

Do not abide in the convention of movement and stillness; also, do not abide in that abiding. 
That middle way without appearance is the awakened mind proclaimed by the Sugata.

This is further clarified:


Even the slightest movement which is not Mañjuśrī is [Mañjuśrī]; there is no abiding there. 

Mipham comments:

If the movement or existence of the slightest subtle fault of sign or concept which is not that dharmatā is seen, since that is the ultimate pristine consciousness of dharmatā or Mañjuśrī, it is not to be abandoned. If it is asked where there is abiding in that dharmatā or Mañjuśrī, since there is no basis in which to abide because the nature of [dharmatā or Mañjuśrī] is not established at all, there is no abiding there.

If you approach practices without any belief in them one way or another, then you are more likely to discover the point of that practice. 

Belief is thinking something is true without knowing whether it is true. This is not the standard we apply in Dzogchen teachings. We apply a higher standard. You do not believe what you know. The main term in Dzogchen is "rig pa," "to know."

The word Rongzom uses is "faith," dad pa or śraddhā. But we have to point out what śraddhā actually means. According to Vasubandhu, faith is the mental factor that brings clarity to the mind. So, "faith" is not belief, per se. In fact, it is one of the five faculties, which are part of the thirty-seven adjuncts to awakening. 

When we look at what the word means in Tibetan, the first definition is confidence (yid ches pa) (the second definition is joy (dga' ba) or attachment(chags pa)). Thus, the passage would be more accurately translated, "People with confidence in the Great Perfection approach realize and penetrate it through being shown this alone." Norbu Rinpoche tends to translate this term as "interest," thus the passage could also be rendered, "People interested in the Great Perfection approach realize and penetrate it through being shown this alone."

Dominic (a nice guy, very smart) also translated "tshul" as "approach," where as I would prefer here to say "principle", thus "People interested/confident in the principles of the Great Perfection realize and penetrate it through being shown this alone."

So yes, the phrase "belief is useless" is absolutely compatible with the above.

No defensive about Dzogchen at all. I think you are holding DGA to a standard you don't observe for yourself.

Ok, you guys can have your beliefs. I personally do not find "believing" in things helpful at all. As ChNN says, "You can believe anything."

When it comes to Dzogchen, belief is useless. There are many other things for which belief is also useless.

I am merely pointing out that you are maintaining a double standard. You feel eminently qualified to opine about Dzogchen, which you do not practice, but question DGA about his practical experience with Chan. Just saying.

There are two trends: the Gandhara trend, influenced by Greek sculpture, and the Mathura tradition, which is much less so and more Indian in appearance.

The Buddha has already allowed the conventional designation of the aggregates as a self. After, all, how many times in the suttas does the Buddha refer to himself in the past tense when discussing his own previous lives?

One can believe anything. What counts is direct experience. One can believe that sugar has all kinds of different tastes. The point is that on only knows sugar by tasting it.

He also rejects the opposite extreme: "the one who acts is other than the one who experiences."

This is because, in the logic of dependent origination, causes and effects are neither the same nor different.

Buddhas have no specific form kāya per se. What form would a Buddha want? Male, female, neutral? One head, one thousand? 

If we were elephants, Samantabhadra would appear to be a blue elephant. Sentient beings perceive buddhas in their own image.

Jay is glossing over the fact that while selves may be refuted, individual mindstreams are strongly defended in Mahāyāna. So, he is just deceptively waltzing down the Secularist path, i.e., "Buddhism" without rebirth. 

Buddhadharma without rebirth makes no sense, likewise, there awakening is not a collective venture.

The Kalacakra war as a metaphor is most fully explained in chapter 5 on the completion stage. In chapter 2, the inner Kalacakra chapter, it is clearly explained that in the war, Rudracakravartin will create an illusion for the Muslims that they are being slaughtered in battle to intimidate them, but that in reality no one is being harmed in anyway. 

As for myself, I will just stick with Dzogchen. I don't relish any more the complex symbolism of the two stages.

Yes, ostensibly the message of the Kalacakra is that Buddhist and Hindus should unite to fend of Muslim encroachment. But this is metaphorical and should not be taken literally, as the text itself makes clear.
