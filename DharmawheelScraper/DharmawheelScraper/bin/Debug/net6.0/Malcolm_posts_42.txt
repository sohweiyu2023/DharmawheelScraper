You don't have to accept it, but this how it is taught in Mahāyāna. As the Lotus Sūtra states:

The devas, humans, and asuras in all the worlds all think that the present Buddha, Śākyamuni, left the palace of the Śākyas, sat on the terrace of enlightenment not far from the city of Gayā, and attained highest, complete enlightenment. However, O sons of a virtuous family, immeasurable, limitless, hundreds of thousands of myriads of koṭis of nayutas of kalpas have passed since I actually attained buddhahood.

Given that this a board devoted to Mahāyāna, one would assume that Mahāyāna teachings would be considered normative here.

In general there are common and uncommon practices of Ngondro. 

The practices of the common ngondro are reflecting on precious human birth eight freedoms and ten endowments, the faults of samsara, death and impermanence, and karma, in some order or another. Everyone must meditate on these. 

After that, in sūtra, the main practice is the six perfections. 

In Vajrayāna, one must practice prostrations in order to prepare the body for meditating the two stages; one must go for refuge and generate bodhicitta, likewise, one must purify with Vajrasattva. One must accumulate vast amounts of merit with mandala offerings which is a part of guru yoga. And one must supplicate the guru. It really does not matter much how much of these one does. What counts is that one does them with full attention as much as possible. You should practice each of these practices until you experience the signs associated with them, which can be learned from the texts so I wont mention those here. Don't focus on numbers.

Where does Gorampa deny the conventional validity of appearances? He merely asserts that when a conventional entity is investigated it cannot be found at all upon analysis. He says:

Therefore all those objects and everything defined on those from the perspective of appearing to a mundane mind is said to be the meaning of defining the relative through the perspective of the conventional.


And:

The characteristic of the ultimate truth: since the noble’s equipoise is beyond cognitive range of ordinary beings, also dualistic vision subsides because of immaculate wisdom, ultimate truth is asserted to be never seeing any extreme of existence and non-existence, permanence or annihilation and so on.

And:

That being so, when seen by a human eye consciousness, regardless of what is seen or not seen by the eye consciousness of the other five kinds of living beings, apart from conventional water appearing to that eye consciousness the others are not perceived, Ultimately there is no also perception of water itself. Your apportioning the substance into six parts is wasted effort of grasping at things. 

That being so, although it has been much boasted that “It is necessary to define the relative as an appearance to non-analytical mind” ultimately it appears to have been defined through an analysis with reason, therefore, there has been a degeneration in the [Gelugpa] presentation of the relative of the prāsangika madhyamaka system.


And:

Although the mere I, the perceived object apprehended by innate self-grasping as “I am” existing conventionally is the prāsangika madhyamaka system, the [Gelugpa] assertion “The mere I exists conventionally even though it is not found to be the same as, different than or both [the same as and different than] the aggregates when its sameness or difference is sought to be established” is very invalid because when it is sought like that even the mere I is necessarily found to be non-existent.  

And:

That mere I itself conventionally is the agent of action and also is the experiencer of ripening in this system defined by the power of appearing to mind of the relative subject because to the mind of a mundane person, the mere I appears as the agent of action and the experiencer of a result, i.e. “I did an action”, “I experienced a result.” 

And:

Prāsaṇgika and Svatantrika do not differ in the presentation of the conventional because the Prāsaṇgikas also accept autonomous arguments in the presentation of the conventional.

So called self-liberation (rang grol) just means being free from grasping, no different than the fourth of the parting of the four attachments, "If grasping arises, one does not have the view."

I also have not noticed that Dzogchen practitioners rapidly increase in realization at a pace swifter than say Vajrayogini practitioners or Hevajra practitioners, or Vajrakilaya practitioners. 

There is also the fact that Dzogchen tregchö, Kagyu Mahāmudra, the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana (Sakya) all have the same point —&nbsp;sustaining an unfabricated awareness in all activities and at all times. If one can do this, that is self-liberation.

So 'things' -even emptiness itself- are empty, but other supposed truths -like separateness/distinction- are not empty at all? Again, why don't people just make all this clearer, rather than leaving the water muddy as they usually do?[/quote]

One of the conventional rules of causation is homogeneity —&nbsp;wheat from wheat seeds, corn from corn seeds, apples from apple seeds and so on. In regards to human beings, we all have our unique set of causes and conditions that both enforces our clade (human) at the same time that it provides us with our individual capacities in intelligence, vision, strength, health, longevity and so on. 

Mindstreams are also unique in the sense that karma that I perform will not ripen on another, nor will the karma of others ripen on me.

And of course, all that arises from causes and conditions is empty.

That very much depends on what kind of experience you are talking about. Buddha remained silent for a while because he thought no one would understand him. 

But it is useless talk about experiences we have not had, for example, awakening. It is like someone talking about California who has never been to California. Don't get me wrong, it is ok to say "I have heard California is nice, I would like to go there. I have a book written by someone who has been to California, and it is supposed to be quite good. In this book and in these reports I have heard this and that."

But too much of the conversation around here winds up with people making pompous proclamations as if they really have experienced awakening, when in fact they are just reciting things they have heard, and even then, often their understanding of what they have read and heard is inaccurate.

Of course it can. As Gorampa points out:

Indeed, but still this is not a statement there is some Mind (capital M) of which everything is nondually composed, and that if we just realize that unity, that is buddhahood. It is not like that. 

Guru Rinpoche's statement in this respect refers to one's subjective experience from yogacara point of view. His statement does not mean that there are not conventionally speaking, infinite myriads of sentient beings, the traces of all of whom sustain the appearance of the container universe. Minds have no form, but they generate appearances based on traces; minds have no form, and yet they are sustained on their own individual sets of causes and conditions —&nbsp;hence we say that they are empty. The inseparability of the two truths means that we do not reject appearances, for example, sentient beings, and we do not imagine that they arise due to any other reason than arising from conditions, which means they are empty, just as we are. It certainly does not mean that as soon as we cease looking at a mountain it ceases to exist.

In any case, this passage does not contradict my assertion that conventionally speaking, the mind is located in the body and its boundaries are the sense organs. All Buddhist traditions agree that mind is located in the center of the body mass, approximately at the heart. Someone might object and say, "What about when it says that when looking for the mind it cannot be found inside the body, outside the body and so on...", this is also true, but conventionally speaking we understand the mind to be located in the "heart".

Sooner or later you are going figure out that you are trying impose Advaita Vedanta concepts on Buddhdharma, and you will realize that it does not work. Then you will have to decide which you like better and than follow that path. But they are not reconcilable.

What is observed in the phenomena of abhijñā, knowing the minds of others, are conceptual thoughts, mental entities marked by characteristics in the minds of another. When our minds become free from such conceptual thoughts, our minds cannot be perceived by others any longer. For example, there were a group of devas fond of a certain monk, with whom they were friends. One day they became alarmed because they could not perceive him in the three realms anymore. They went to the Buddha, who told them that this monk had become an arhat and was in a samadhi of cessation, and therefore, since his mind was free from any characteristics while in that state, they could not perceive his mind. This how the abhijñā of knowing the minds of others works. This is why only a mind which embraces a characteristic can be known to a yogi who has such capacity.

Why don't you try reading the paragraph immediately before these two:

In both traditions it is natural for a practitioner to have unusual physiological and psychological reactions — seeing, hearing, or even dreaming things out of the ordinary. A Tantric practitioner will take what he has seen, heard, or dreamt as signals that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are recognizing his practice. A Ch’an practitioner may also have such experiences, but they are not emphasized and are not taken as signals or signs of anything in particular.

Of course, the above statement is also inaccurate. A "Tantric" practitioner will do no such thing. Every practice as specific experiences that are outlined, including dreams, and when a practitioner has such experiences described in the text, it is taken as an indication that their practice is moving ahead.

There is no substratum, minds do not "overlap." The reason why Buddhas and high bodhisattvas can know the minds of others, know past lives, etc. is because the nature of everything is emptiness and therefore while there is no universal substratum there is also no impediments because everything is empty. And since everything is empty, Buddha's wisdom is unimpeded in all directions and times.

We have three dimensions, body, voice and mind. The Buddha's have three kāyas. The nirmanakāya exist because ordinary sentient beings cannot have contact with the sambgogakāya at all because of the afflictions they possess. When they remove those afflictions, then they can see the Sambhogakāya, but this takes many countless eons lifetimes of practice. Finally, when they become a Buddha, they can see the dharmakāya. 

Therefore, all transmissions for ordinary people like ourselves occur on an external physical way, through speech and symbols. If we happen to realize the meaning of what is being taught, this is referred to a "mind transmission", but it is not really a transmission in the sense of a message communicated and a message received mentally. It is more in the sense of a message communicated through words and symbols whose inner significance is then realized directly. Anyone who tells you that there is some actually mind to mind transmission in Buddhadharma at the level of our impure perception is either lying or they have no idea what they are talking about. 

Buddhas cannot communicate liberation into the minds of others. If they could, there would be no sentient beings left. The Buddha said famously, we cannot wash away suffering, he cannot remove it with his hand, nor can he make us liberated, but he can teach us a path.

It would be the Buddha or his disciples. Really, what we are talking about here is citational or scriptural authority. The Samdhinirmocana Sūtra states:

As such, the reasoning of a valid proof is the authority of direction perception; the authority of inference, and the authority of trustworthy citations which is valid through the five valid characteristics.

Those five valid characteristics are:

The characteristic of being supported on a direct perception, the characteristic of being supported on a direct perception which is the basis for that, the characteristic of the application of example in one's own reasoning, the characteristic of perfectly establishment and the characteristic of a scripture proven to be completely valid. 

You should look into this sūtra for a more detailed explanation.

It is a totally independent source of knowledge, and indeed Dharmakirti for example spends an entire chapter devoted to proving why we can for example accept the Buddha as an authority. 

But we also have this from the Pubbakotthaka Sutta:

Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation."

They do not [possess the nature of their imputed object], and this is why tables can function as tables. Tables function as tables solely because we designate a collection of parts a table and use it as such. There is no table at all apart from our imputation. The table is empty of a table because a table is solely an imputation from our side. The collection of parts we are designating as a table has not been table from its own side ever and will never be such a table, and therefore is empty of the table we are imputing. 

There is no table in absence of the parts either, since there is no basis upon which to impute the table. 

Your argument suffers from being conned by the pyramid scheme of realism —&nbsp;the idea that you can just keep borrowing from someone else to pay off your previous investors. Your argument suffers from a hidden flaw of unconsciously resorting to parabhāva, gzhan dngos, dependent existence, which is just a form of inherent existence, svabhāva, rang bzhin.

We were not talking about afflictions, we were talking about sense objects. In the common Mahāyāna and Hinayāna they are something strictly to be given up. In Vajrayāna they are something to be used. When we say that Vajrayāna is a path of nonrenunciation (and if anyone has doubts about this I suggest they go talk to HH Sakya Trizin, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and so on) we are not saying that it is a path in which one indulges one's afflictions.

Therefore it follows that for you an illusory elephant is not empty of being an "elephant" because it bears the characteristics of an elephant (trunks, tusks, etc.) upon which one may impute the conventional designation elephant.

Tables hold their own nature? How, where? In their parts or separate from them? Your conclusion does not follow from your premise. A collection of parts designated a "table" is still empty of being a table even though it can be used as one, just as a collection of aggregates is empty of a self even though it can be designated one. It follows that if tables are not empty of tables then persons are not empty of persons, selves are not empty of selves and you have in one mistaken argument turned the whole of the Buddha's teaching on its head. According to you we must accept that the self actually exists merely on the basis of being designated upon the aggregates, which violates on the basic four seals, "All phenomena are not a self." Such a conclusion is not acceptable to Vasubandu in the Refutation of the Pudgala  much less Nāgārjuna, Aryadeva, Bhaviveka or Candrakirtī. Nāgārjuna states:

All living beings are causes and results.
There are no sentient beings at all. 
Empty dharmas are entirely  produced 
from dharmas strictly empty; 
dharmas without a self and [not] of a self.

I did not say there was no preliminary sense of renunciation in Vajrayāna. What I said was is that Vajrayāna is not a PATH of renunciation. 

This is the logic. We understand that samsara is a terrible place. We wish to be free of it. We look around, and we see that the path of renunciation is not effective in this day and age because our afflictions are too strong. This is why the tantra says things like the Vajrapañjara-tantra:

Created by passion, the worldly
shall be liberated by the same passion.

Or the Guhyasamaja:

The passionate desiring wisdom
always rely on the five desire objects

The method of doing this, of practicing a path of non-renunciation, is to practice creation stage and completion stages. Likewise, through the method is a little different in Dzogchen as the Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva states:

This nectar of bodhicitta, one’s vidyā, 
for example, is like a divine precious jewel
that warms when left in a cold place,
cools when left in a hot place,
and gives light when left in a dark place.
In the same way, if one possesses the meaning of realizing
this self-originated vidyā,
afflictions become the companions of wisdom, 
even though afflictions arise 
they do not obscure when they are under the power of wisdom. 

And:

If the king of secret mantra is practiced, afflictions turn into wisdom. For example, when a lamp is lifted in an empty house, darkness turns into light; likewise, when the lamp of wisdom is raised, ignorance transforms into vidyā. When the realization of reality has arisen in one’s continuum, all afflictions arise as the companions of wisdom.

Refrain from all evil,
perfect [all] virtues,
thoroughly tame one's mind:
this is the teaching of the Buddha. 

One is supposed to avoid evil (pappa, sinful) actions because they lead to birth in lower realms. One is to engage in virtuous (kusala) actions because they lead to birth in higher realms. One is to tame one's mind, because this is the path to liberation. 

But here there is no mention of being a "good person." The goal of Buddhadharma is not to become "a better person." The goal of the Dharma is to transcend our afflictive state so that it is no longer necessary to engage in positive actions to maintain a birth in higher realms and avoid negative actions which lead to rebirth in lower realms. As long as one is driven by the three poisons, it is not possible to be a truly "good person."

For example, even through we practice the six perfections in order to attain buddhahood with the motivation to become buddhas for the benefit of all sentient beings, as you note below, bodhisattva activity may not be considered the actions of a "good person" when viewed from outside. 

Secondly the practice of the six perfections is actually for one's own benefit, not directly for the benefit of others. The four means of conversion on the other hand are directly for the benefit of others. One should understand this distinction well.

For example, the Buddha gave his horse and ornaments to his father, Śuddhodhana, when he self-ordained. The golden bowl given to him by Sujāta was left in the Nairañja rather than being given to some poor local villagers. Buddha's disposition of his wealth does not conform to either conservative notions of wealth preservation nor does it conform to liberal notions of social justice. He gave away his horse and gear to his father who did not need them, and left his golden bowl in a stream while there villagers just a stone's throw away who were suffering crushing poverty. 

As Sakya Paṇḍita explains:

If wealth of the higher classes was given to the lower classes by the Bhagavan, although slight beneficial conditions for this life would occur, since it would become a cause of lower realms because of not requesting liberation, the Bodhisattva decided he would not give his wealth away. 

Or there is the Jataka tale of how the Buddha in his past life as Viśvaṃtara gave away his wife and children to be brahmin’s servants when practicing the perfection of generosity ——&nbsp;such acts hardly conform to our modern liberal notions of the "good person." 

So we really must not allow such tepid notions as "Buddhism is just about being a good person" to go unchallenged.

The Buddha's path starts with refuge. For example, in the Kalmas sutra:

As if, venerable sir, a person were to turn face upwards what is upside down, or to uncover the concealed, or to point the way to one who is lost or to carry a lamp in the darkness, thinking, 'Those who have eyes will see visible objects,' so has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the Blessed One. We, venerable sir, go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma for refuge, and to the Community of Bhikkhus for refuge. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One regard us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life, from today."

The Buddhist path does not in any sense discourage one from thinking of oneself as a "buddhist". 

The idea that the Buddha placed more importance on being a "good person" than on the three trainings of śīla, samadhi and prajñā, and the three prajñās of hearing, reflection and meditation is really a very strange and misleading idea. Being a good person will not free one from samsara, which after all is the point of the Buddha's teachings, i.e., to become from from samsara.

This represents a total misunderstanding of what Dzogchen is and what Vajrayāna is. Dzogchen is not separate from Vajrayāna in anyway shape of form. Dzogchen is a part of Vajrayāna Secret Mantra as even a cursory examination of the basic texts of the tradition will indicate. 

Further, Dzogchen may not necessarily involve the four hundred thousands famous to us, in fact one of the earliest presentations of that sequence of practice is to be found in the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma tantra, which forms the foundation for most of the Nyinthig cycles from the Khandro Nyinthig onward. Moreover, there are a series of preliminary practices in Dzogchen that are indispensable such as the separation of samsara and nirvana, semzins, and so on. 

Empowerment is absolutely necessary in Vajrayāna. Dzogchen Atiyoga is merely one of three inner tantra divisions. It is not in any way separate from Vajrayāna at all. Not only, they are hardly "another form of mindfulness practice."

Stick to Zen, Astus, you are out of your depth when commenting on Tibetan Buddhism.

Bhavaviveka says:

If there is an autonomous argument, it is only necessary to establish that the given phenomena appear in common to the proponent and opponent because at that time the given phenomena has not been established in common appearance.”

On other words, all that is needed is an agreement that indeed a table appears before both parties. They needn't agree on anything else. Thus when Bhavaviveka rejects Buddhapalita's dialectical argument in favor of a procedural argument, he is not saying that we need to accept that there is a seed established by an intrinsic characteristic, he is merely saying that we admit only that we both perceive a seed which then can be analyzed, in this case, of whether it is reasonable that there is arising from self. 

The reason why Candra rejects Bhavaviveka's insistence on a procedural argument rather than a dialectical argument stems from the following:

When the eye and so on is grasped as a given phenomena of the relative, it is not established for the proponent; and when the eye and so on is grasped as a given phenomena of the ultimate, it is not established for the opponent.

In this case, since there is a fundamental disagreement in terms of the basis where one is arguing from, Candra insists that the opponent merely needs to be overthrown with a dialectical argument. But one thing it is important to bear in mind, Candrakīrti does not go at great lengths to expand his views on this subject in the Prasannapāda. Moreover, Candra certainly accepts procedural or autonomous arguments when presenting the conventional. 

Thus there is no difference in these Madhyamikas Madhyamaka, but there is a difference in how one should debate opponents, and that is all. Gorampa states in his Moonrays:

Therefore the essential point of the difference between Prāsaṇgika and Svatantrika is defined upon whether autonomous arguments are accepted or not accepted in the context of investigating reality, i.e. it is actually in the context of rejecting the arising of the four extremes that autonomous arguments validity or invalidity is negated or proven.

He assumes that thing cannot be empty of themselves (intrinsically empty) because he believes this would destroy their conventional value. But this is not a proper Madhyamaka view as we can see from the citation of Candra above, where Candra clearly states that there are no possessors of parts, they are unreal, they are simply designations. 

The profound point in all of this is that Candra maintain that rather than a consciousness taking rebirth, which is the position of Bhavaviveka, what takes rebirth is the mistaken habit of "I-making," which conventionally can act as an appropriator of the aggregates and also can engage in and experience the ripening of actions even though the 'I" does not exist and is not real —&nbsp;it can act and behave as it if were real, in much the same that we drive cars that we have designated upon parts whch however, are unreal when they are sought for.

A table does not possess the parts of the car, so it won't work as a car, even you try to drive it. 

A table is still empty of a table, however, because when the parts of a table are examined, a table cannot be found. 

There does not need to be any essence of a table for a collection of parts to be designated table. Whether the table or car is a conventionally valid table or car purely depends on whether that table or car works or not, whether it is functional [arthakriya, don byed].

No, here we are just talking about how things are designated on their parts according to their conventional appearance to a non-deluded mind. For our friends TD and TKF, it appears, based on their statements, that tables appear to a conventional valid cognition automatically. 

According to Candrakirti, things are designated upon parts they tentatively "possess". If the thing functions, it is conventionally valid; if not, it is conventionally invalid, for example, the attempt to fill a horse with gas instead of hay. 

Knowing that things are not real, are intrinsically empty, while still acting in accordance with worldly convention is the path if a follower of the middle way.

This text by Sa’i-rtsa-lag is mentioned by the Third Karmapa, so it was translated into Tibetan no later than the late 13th-early fourteenth century.

To make it more clear to you, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen (12th century) writes:

Further, the bodhicitta of Vairocana in the second chapter of the Guhyasamāja states:

Free from all phenomena;
skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas,
and subject and object abandoned;
because phenomena are equally without self, 
one’s mind, having never arisen from the beginning,
is naturally empty. 

In dependence upon which, Master Nāgārjuna wrote the Bodhicittavivarana.

Now, the late Indian and Tibetan tradition have long held that Nāgārjuna I and the siddha Nāgārjuna, the disciple of Saraha, are one and the same person. I personally do not subscribe to this belief, holding instead that there are at the very least two authentic Nāgārjuna's. 

Be that as it may, it is a fact that the Bodhicittavivarana is a tantric work associated with Guhyasamaja, and specifically is a commentary on the above passage. I erred above when I stated it concerned the abhisambodhi of Akṣobhya. The Dohakośa of Saraha was written to comment upon that, being this following statement, Jetsun Rinopche writes:

In addition to that, the bodhicitta of Akśobhya in the second chapter of the Guhyasamāja states:

In the ultimate, phenomena
of the three realms are meditated as being unreal,
the existents meditated as unreal
are not meditated as objects of meditation;
therefore, the real and the unreal
are not objects of meditation.

Your reason is specious. We don't need to speak of a car being empty of a table at all because we do not (in worldly convention) impute tables on the parts of a car, nor a car on the parts of table. Nevertheless, a table is empty of being a table since when its parts are examined no table can be found, likewise a car is found to be empty of a car since no car can be found when its parts are examined. 

The emptiness of cars, tables and selves are alike inso far as the parts upon which cars, tables and selves are imputed are all equally found to be empty respectively of cars, tables and selves. In other words, no car can be found when its parts are examined, no table can be found when its parts are examined, no self can be found when its parts are examined, meaning that anything designated on parts is merely an empty designation with no underlying reality at all.

Candra says directly after the citation you produced:

How can that which does not exist through seven aspects, 
be said to exist? The existence of this will not be found by the yogin. 
Since he rests with ease in reality, 
here, the proposition of that [chariot, etc.] is also asserted. 
If the chariot is not real, at that time, 
nothing has parts, nor are there any parts. 
For example, just as when the chariot is burned there are no parts, 
the parts are [burned] when the possessor of parts is burned with the fire of intelligence.

So here, the reality is that tables, chariots, selves and so on are empty of themselves because they cannot withstand analysis, also their components cannot withstand analysis, and when subject to ultimate analysis they cannot be found. Nevertheless, 

A table is precisely imputed on its parts which are empty of being "a table" —&nbsp;it is for this reason that tables are empty of being tables, since they are composed of parts upon which a table is imputed and in which a table will never be found. 

When a convention is subject to analysis is it naturally destroyed in the process of analysis in just the same way that a hammer shatters a pot. If you interpret Candra the way you do, you disallow any ultimate analysis —&nbsp;but what Candra states is the following:

"Just a cart is designated in dependent on wheels and so on, wheels and so on are appropriated on that basis, but the chariot is not an appropriator, in the same way, because the self (a mundane convention that is not negated in relative truth), like a chariot, is asserted to be an appropriator."

Candra here makes an important point about all this —&nbsp;the chariot is not an actual appropriator, why? Because it is merely designated on some parts, a wheel and so on. Likewise the self is not a real appropriator because it is designation on some parts. Nevertheless, in terms of the mundane convention in the relative, we do not negate chariots, selves and so on, even though chariots, selves and so on are not real, being mere designations on the basis of some parts. But your mistake is to assume that a chariot is being designated a chariot on the basis of a chariot, and this is utterly wrong. 

Candra continues:

The five aggregates, the six elements and the six sense bases are the appropriations of that self because a self is designated on the basis of the five aggregates and so on, just as the wheels and so are the appropriations of the chariot

The self is conventionally asserted to be an appropriator of karma, merit, aggregates and so on, because it is designated on the basis of the five aggregates. As we see above, however, there is actually no self that can act as an appropriator since such a self does not exist, being a mere imputation. 

He then continues:

Just as this presentation of the appropriated and the appropriated is a presentation of mundane convention, likewise, it is explained "This action and agent is to be accepted like the chariot." The appropriated is the action, this also is the agent. The so-called "appropriated", the aggregates and so on are the action, and the self is presented as a so-called "agent." 

Because this is not real, this is not stable,
this is not unstable, this neither arises or perishes.
Here there is no permanence and so on, 
there is neither sameness nor difference. 

Though this self designated upon the aggregates is not stable, it is also not unstable. In that respect, if the self is unstable, at that time:
 
The appropriated are not the self,
those are produced and perish. 
How could the appropriated
turn into the appropriator? 

In the same way:

There is no production from the unproduced, 
for consequently there will be a fault here,
the self will either be a product
or will be produced without a cause. 

Thus, there is a contradiction with the śāstra. Because of that, if the aggregates are the self, if it comes to be possess arising and perishing, also it is not asserted as having arising or perishing. Therefore, the consequence that the aggregates "are not the self" will be valid. Because of that, the instability of this [self] is not valid, nor its stability. 

Therefore, it is perfectly accurate to say that the self is empty of the self, chariots are empty of chariots, tables of empty of tables. What ever is designated on parts is empty of itself because it is mere designation that cannot be found upon analysis of the parts upon which it is designated. If it were only empty of inherent existence, then selves, chariots, tables and so on could be found in the basis of investigating their parts.

It is useful to remember that most people practicing Chan/Son/Zen in the old days were people already well trained in Buddhadharma.

Ancient scholars often understood stories on multiple levels, without one contradicting the other in their minds, despite seeming contradictions in ours.

For example, Rahu is used as a metaphor in the Kalacakra tantra for certain practices that lead to the cessation of ordinary concepts, but the Kalacakra also contains elaborate calculations for calculating eclipses on the presumption that the outer world mirrors the anatomy of the human body and vice versa, with the added assumption that a powerful enough yogin could control external eclipses by controlling his body.

What Sherlock is saying is that in general, since the appearance of a history about the arrival of Śāntarakṣita and Padmasambhava to Tibet called the sba bzhed i.e., "The Narrative of Sba",  sometime between the late 9th and early 12th century, many Tibetan scholars such as Sakya Pandita have held views about Chan Buddhism in general based on what is reported in that text. 

Sherlock's point is that there is more than one report about the positions of Hashang Mahayana and in his opinion, those following the Narrative of Sba are giving consideration only to a very one sided point of view of Hashang's actual views, and that Hashang has become a strawman that Tibetan schools use to attack each other with. 

In other words, what Sherlock is questioning is whether or not Sba gsal snang's reporting on Hashang's views are actually factual. Many modern scholars think the entire episode was entirely fabricated for political reasons. 

Later Nyingmapa's have also expressed hostility at the Sba bzhed literature because it contradicts later terma biographies on many details, such as asserting that Padmasambhava was the actual son of the King of Oddiyāna and so on.

Of course the are some problems with Nubchen's account as well since he has Bodhidharma traveling to Tibet and arriving with one shoe in his hand.

The tradition that the Bodicittavivarana is associated with the Guhyasamaja Tantra is well established, considering the term "bodhicitta" in that tantra is used as a term for ultimate reality.

Two problems here: 

One, tables are empty of being tables. If tables were not empty being tables, conventional tables could withstand analysis, and so too could all things made of parts, such as persons. A table appears/exists, and a table is imputed on its parts, like persons, but it cannot be found to withstand ultimate analysis. In the process of analyzing a table, also the table ceases to be apprehended. This principle is well established even in lower tenet systems such as Abhidharma, where the cognition of a pot ceases the moment it is broken into shards, and so on. 

Second, this perspective — that the appearance/existence of conventionally imputed tables can withstand ultimate analysis while their inherent existence cannot — makes it difficult to practice the creation stage, since our so called conventional valid cognition perceives impure appearances and not pure appearances of the mandala and so on. The latter requires training and purification.

No one perceives inherent existence, which is a philosophical abstraction. People do perceive existence, and that is what is negated through Madhyamaka analysis because that is what people perceive. But negating existence is not enough, one must also negate nonexistence, both and neither. When one is an ārya, however, one does not need to proceed through the four-fold negation. 

The Sakyas maintain that the difference between Bhavaviveka and Candra is pedagogical only.

I am not saying it is popular in the Chinese tradition, I am saying that its source is Chinese. 

The idea of ranking sutras in terms of provisionality and definitiveness comes primarily from the Chinese commentary in the Samdhinirmocana Sutra. Chinese Buddhism indeed has a number of schemes where the Buddha's teachings are ranked according to when he is supposed to gave taught them, but the source of the idea of three turnings of the wheel elaborated in this way is this commentary that I mentioned by Won-ch'uk, the 'phags pa dgongs pa zab mo nges par 'grel pa'i mdo rgya cher 'grel pa in three volumes. Since this concept is virtually absent from Indian sources, it must be from Chinese sources.

Basically, what it amounts to is the very Chinese Buddhist idea, later widely adopted by Kagyus and Nyingmas, that there were very clear sets of sutras that could be distinguished by the turning to which they belong. 

Nubchen asserts that Hashang depended on these definitive sutras, and that Kamashila depended on provisional sutras. 

But here, Nubchen is showing evidence of influence from Chinese Buddhism. It is really nothing more profound than this. 

This is fine, but the reality of it is that the Indians never gave any importance to idea of three turnings at all. I don't either, which is why I find Nubchen's notion that Hashang's teachings are higher than Kamalashila's based on which turning of wheel to which they supposedly adhere to be a completely bogus proposition, DOA. Understandable, but DOA. Accepting Nubchen's POV on this means accepting the distinction between the three turnings as understood in Chinese Buddhism and I simply do not think that is a particularly valid way of understanding sūtras.

The consensus has come down this: in order for there to be an order of nuns in Tibetan Buddhism, they must receive a living lineage from other nuns. Luckily, this still exists in Chinese Buddhism, in the Dharmaguptaka order. The main difficulty here is that these nuns are not and never will be Mulasarvastivadin nuns.

In general, the response is that sentient beings do not differentiate between existence and inherent existence. Because this is so, while it is true that Candrakīrit indeed identifies a subtle object of negation, inherent existence, the actual object of negation is the course object of negation, existence, because that is what sentient beings actually perceive and are actually deluded by. 

Also, the problem with Tsongkhapa's hermeneutics here involve the fact that he is basically stating that while buddhas have no conceptual apprehension of their own, they apprehend the conceptual apprehensions of sentient beings, and that seems like a very strange position. The general position of Candrakirti seems to be:

The peaceful kāya manifests like a wishfulfilling tree, 
is nonconceptual like a wishfulfilling gem, 
always existing for the benefit of the world until migrating beings are liberated, 
this [kāya] appears free of proliferation

Meaning it is not necessary for buddhas to apprehend the concepts of sentient beings since they act effortlessly without concepts on the behalf of sentient beings like wishfulfilling gems and so on.

You apparently choose to ignore Nāhārjuna's statement, "Where is there an existence not included in inherent existence or dependent existence (another species of inherent existence)."

The process of b arising from a is not dependent origination. There are no single causes in the chain of dependent origination, which is why dependent existence is rejected by Nāgārjuna as species of inherent existence. Dependent origination means arising from a combination of causes and conditions. For example, a sprout arises not merely from a seed, but from soil, moisture, warmth and so on. 

The point is that Nāgārjuna is rejecting dependent existence in favor of dependent origination. I really do not see why it is so hard for you to understand this. Since we are just going around in circles, I am going to stop this here. I won't respond to this thread anymore.

Correction, it is a unique tenet of Tsonkhapa's interpretation of Prasangika. 

Since Goramapa lists more than 150 points of contention with Tsongkhapa's presentation of Prasangika Madhyamaka, it is really much better if you qualify your presentation with Tsonkhapa's interpretation since many of his unique interpretations are unknown to Indians as well as Tibetans. I understand that devotees of Tsongkhapa consider this to be a feature, whereas detractors of Tsongkhapa consider these innovations to be bugs in his view. 

I myself am not expert enough in Tsongkhapa's writings to say much about them with certainty, but in general, I have personally found Goramapa's criticisms of Tsongkhapa's views regarding sūtra and tantra well founded. On the other hand, I generally accept Tsongkhapa's criticisms of Jonang view as having merit.

We will have an odd situation where bhikṣus will be ordained according to one Vinaya, and bhikṣunis according to another.

Your argument is senseless and supposes that the Buddha argues for first causes, which he explicitly rejects. This is why we frequently see such statements by the Buddha as "beginningless samsara" and "samsara without a beginning." According to you, when the Buddha makes such statements he is lying or by making such statements, he is proving he is not omniscient.

For example, the Ārya-saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra states:

In beginningless samsara,
recall the result of positive deeds is happiness, 
the result of negative deeds
is likewise suffering, 
arising like causes and results, 
but do not engaged in false thinking. 
Whatever is made by a past cause,
likewise it's result will be obtained.

You directly contradict the teaching of the Buddha by rejecting infinite regression of causes because of your conflation of the unsuitability of infinite regress in logical argumentation with the fact that any series of conditioned causes and effects must be beginningless.

Here, the term dharma [phenomena] means bearer of characteristics. That is all a "phenomenon" is. The term "phenomena" for "dharma" is very inadequate, but it is what we have. 

Space and the two cessations, as well as emptiness, all are known through their characteristics. 

Space is simply the absence of obstruction, and of the two cessations, the first is nirvana, cessation due to insight. The second cessation is simple absence of a cause for arising. 

These three things make up the classic trio of unconditioned dharmas [there is also a kind of conditioned space, which is defined as a cavity. But that is not what is being discussed here].

When the obscuration of affliction and knowledge are eliminated, falling back into samsara is impossible because the stream of cittas is not longer adventitiously contaminated, so how could it become contaminated again? But the Buddha has assured us that liberation is a permanent state of affairs. Your objection was actually a non-sequitor. 

The reason there is an infinite chain of cittas is that cittas are relative and conditioned, each one is an effect as well as a cause. In this case the infinite regression is a reasonable inference, just as Nāgārjuna specifically allows that an infinite regression of tathāgatas in the past is also reasonable.

The notion that the ālayavijñāna is accompanied by a vāyu is even found in Buddhist Ayurveda. Candarānanda's commentary on the Aṣṭangahridayasamhita states:

First, the moment the male’s semen and the female’s blood, free from the defects of vata, and so on, a consciousness possessing karma and afflictions accompanied by the five very subtle elements of space and so on (which are objects of yoga beyond the range of sense organs) gather and fuse in the uterus, it is called fertilization in the uterus.

What I was specifically referring to was a doctrine which comes from the Vajramāla Tantra, which is a commentary tantra on the Guhyasamaja. And a major source for the functioning of the five or ten vāyus in Vajrayāna completion stage practice.

At the outset of this chapter, chapter 15, Nāgārjuna states:

It is not reasonable for inherent existence [svabhāva] to arise from causes and conditions;
an inherent existence that arises from causes and conditions would have been produced,
How can this be correct? 
Inherent existences are unfabricated
and do not depend on others.
If there is no inherent existence,
where will there be dependent existence [parabhāva]? 


Having already defined dependent existence (parabhāva) as a species of inherent existence (svabhāva), Nāgārjuna states:

Where is there an existence not included in inherent existence or dependent existence?
If there were inherent existence or dependent existence, existence would be established.

An existence that is not an inherent existence is therefore impossible. So, my definition of existence is that "existence" as such is a mere convention and nothing further. Much like a self.

This because you haven't incorporated the path framework of Mahāyāna into your understanding. Simply put, on the path of preparation there is a stage called "heat", which is a conceptual meditation which resembles the insight realized on the path of seeing. This in turn leads to a stage called "peaks", where one's samadhi peaks and nearly becomes the yoga pratyakṣa on emptiness of the path of seeing. There is a further stage called patience, where one turns away from all rebirth in the three lower realms as a result of the previously cultivated samadhi, and finally the stage called "highest mundane dharmas", which immediately precedes attainment of the path of seeing. 

There are no other approaches within the Mahayana. This is the Mahāyāna path.

It has already been pointed out to you that the status of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is not certain even within Chinese Buddhism and it has been subject to much controversy, unlike say the Prajñāpāramita or the Lankāvatāra sūtras. 

 That Tibetans eat meat is a Tibetan cultural thing. It has nothing to do with the Dharma and there is really no justification for meat-eating that can be found in Mahāyāna sutras. Avoidance of eating meat is well known in Mahāyāna sutras such as the Mahāparinivana, Lankāvatāra, and so on. Many Tibetan Buddhists have been and are vegetarian. 

In general, if one is following common Mahāyāna one should not eat meat unless one is ill. On the other hand, there is no Mahāyāna vow not to eat meat which is connected with the bodhisattva vows. The Buddha mentions the faults of eating meat in many sūtras, but never made it a vow that one should not.

The difference is that both Tibetan Buddhists and Chan Buddhists are followers of Mahāyāna. We both generally accept the same Dharma, we both generally accept that same set of Mahāyāna sūtras which can be confirmed to be of Indian origin. The differences in the basic sūtras we both accept are trivial. 

There are a few sūtras in the Chinese canon which were not translated into Tibetan because even during the 8th and early ninth century there was uncertainty as to their validity. Many Mahāyāna sūtras were translated into Tibetan first from Chinese sources and only later were revised with respect to Sanskrit manuscripts.

We can say that it is accepted by some Chan masters as authentic and we can at the same time deny it is authentic, which is to say it is not a sutra spoken by the Buddha, nor a sutra which he gave permission to one his disciples to speak, nor did he confer his blessings upon anyone to speak it. 

We can therefore also understand that some Chan masters will assert various things said in that sūtra and feel under no obligation to take them or it seriously on such subjects since we do not accept the sūtra in question is authentic and since it conflicts with what authentic sūtras say on the subject, in this case, of consuming garlic.

The latter statement is to understood in the light of the former, since I already laid out what I consider to be "authentic", i.e. a Mahāyāna sūtra of confirmed Indian origin. Neither the Brahamjala Sūtra, nor the Śūraṅgama Sūtra, nor the Sūtra in Forty-Eight Chapters can be considered authentic Indian texts. We can also toss in the Vajrasamadhi Sūtra for good measure.

If the teachings in these texts conform to what we know to be taught in authentic sūtras, then those teachings can be accepted —&nbsp;but if there are teachings in those texts which do not conform, then those teachings should be ignored, such as the idea that garlic will send one to hell for eating it.

In order to understand emptiness, freedom from views, one must understand dependent origination, which is also freedom from views. That which originates in dependence does not exist according to any of the four extremes, therefore, whatever dependently originates is empty by nature. For this reason, Nāgārjuna praised dependent origination as the pacification of proliferation. He likewise maintained that those who understand emptiness incorrectly were likes those who handled a snake at the wrong end or applied vidyāmantras incorrectly. He called such people incorrigible. 

When one correctly apprehends emptiness, there is no support left for conceptual thought to rest upon, so it dissolves into itself, right on the spot. It for this reason then that Shantideva states:

When neither an entity nor a nonentity
remain before the mind, 
at that time, since there is no other aspect 
there is nothing to perceive, total peace. 

The point is not to have a view, the point is go beyond views —&nbsp;but the road there is narrow.

I am sorry, but there is no mention of negative mental effects of garlic in any authentic Mahāyāna sutra.

I am not questioning Master Sheng Yen's knowledge of the Chinese canon. But I don't think there is any reason to accept what the Chinese Surangama Samadhi has to say at all. I don't consider it an authentic Mahāyāna sūtra. Just because a chapter of it is included in the Tibetan canon does not guarantee its authenticity. There are several texts included in the sutra and dharani section of the Tibetan canon whose authenticity is disputed. This is one of those texts.

Precepts come from taking vows. If you have not taken a given vows, you cannot break the precept to which it is connected. 

For example, fully ordained Mulasarvastivadin monks who eat  garlic and who are not ill are considered to have committed a downfall of duration. Eating onion or spring onions is considered an offense. Why? Because one should not enter a temple after eating these things. 

But in Vinaya, the reason is given that sick monks are allowed to eat these things because there is no question that they will being going to a temple. If a monk eats these things, in the case of garlic, he should not enter a temple for a week, in the case of onions, for three days and the case of spring onions, one day. It is a downfall punished by brief period of banishment. But there is certainly no mention of going to hell and such things can easily be purified. 

And as far as we are concerned, none of us here are ordained bhikṣus, so really, the idea that eating garlic is going to send one to hell is ridiculous. Not only this, but the Lankāvatara states exactly the opposite of what is stated here in this sutra about spirits:

Since the bhūtas will become terrified
yogis should not eat meat.
Likewise, yogis should avoid
various things such as
meat, garlic, onions and alcohol,
garlic and spring onions.

Yes, garlic is mentioned twice in this passage. Again, no mention of hell for eating garlic. One can infer from the passage however that it upsets local spirits and frightens them because of the smell, which is of course why garlic is used to repel spirits in Ayurvedic medicine and in many Buddhist texts.

The only food that will send you hell is meat you have killed for yourself or requested be killed for yourself.

The example comes from Nāgārjuna's Verses on Depdendent Origination:

Words, butter lamps, mirrors, seals,
fire crystals, seeds, sourness and echoes.

His Commentary on the Verses of Dependent Origination states:

Likewise, just as a butter lamp is produced from a butter lamp; the reflection of a mirror produced from a likeness; a seal impression from a seal; fire from a fire crystal; a sprout from a seed, saliva caused by sour fruit and an echo from a sound. Also those can easily be understood to be neither the same nor different. 

In any case, consciousness exists in a series of single moments, so unlike a candle flame, it does not give rise to more than one subsequent moment of consciousness in a given series. As Nāgārjuna points out, the aggregates are serially connected. He says:

Those [aggregates], called ‘serially joined’, not having ceased, produce another produced from that cause; although not even the subtle atom of an existent has transmigrated from this world to the next.

The Buddha taught rebirth without making recourse to a self that undergoes rebirth. 

There are a variety of ways of explaining this, but in essence, the most profound way of understanding this is that the habit of I-making appropriates a new series of aggregates at death, and so it goes on and on until one eradicates the knowledge obscuration that creates this habit of I-making. In the meantime, due to this habit of I-making, one continues to accumulate affliction and karma which results in suffering for infinite lifetimes, just as one has taken rebirth in samsara without a beginning. 

But no soul-concept has been introduced in this thread, not at all. The sentient being I was in a past life is not identical with me in this life, even though I suffer and enjoy the results of the negative and positive actions that sentient being and all the other sentient beings engaged in who make up the serial chain of the continuum which I now enjoy. But when I die, all trace of my identity will cease since my identification with my five aggregates as "me" and "mine" is a delusion, and that identity, self, soul, etc., exists merely as a convention and not as an ultimate truth. When the habit of I-making that drives my continuum in samsara takes a new series of aggregates in the next life, it is unlikely I will have any memory of this lifetime, and my habit of I-making will generate a new identity based on the cause and conditions it encounters in the next life. 

It is important to understand that this "I" generated by the habit of I-making does not exist and is fundamentally a delusion. But it is a useful delusion, just like the delusion of a car allows us to use one.

An analogy is using the last candle to light the next candle. One cannot say that two flames are different, nor can one say they are identical, but they do exist in a continuum, a discrete series.

No, this is not a sūtra directed at monks who still believe in a soul or an atman. This is a sūtra directed at monks who understand that there is no person to be found in the five aggregates. 

The Buddha defined the four types of awakened person by virtue of the number of lifetimes it would take before they entered nirvana, for example, it would take a stream entrant to attain nirvana (seven), arhats achieve nirvana in this lifetime. 

Stream entrants by definition are free from the fetter of believing in a self or an atman.

The Buddha did not have a problem with it. Maybe there is some sūtra composed in China which says such a thing, but there are no such sūtras in the Tibetan canon.

There are certain restrictions in Vinaya on paṇḍakas that I know of such as: people who can only be aroused through voyeurism (and these are not even necessarily "gay" people), intersexed people and men who enjoy swallowing semen are barred from becoming ordained. Otherwise, the Buddhist sūtras and tantras really do not have much to say about paṇḍakas.

In Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine one's gender preference is biologically determined by various factors during conception and pregnancy, for the most part.

Actually, garlic is a main ingredient in herbal formulas for repelling attacks by bhūtas, nāgas and so on. 

But generally, one is to avoid eating it and onions because they grew from the drops of blood of Rahu mixed with amrita which fell to the earth when Rahu was decapitated. But because Rahu's blood was mixed with amrita, these plants are also medicinal.

In the Lankāvatāra is recommended that one desist from eating garlic, and also in the lower tantras. Also Mulasarvastivadin bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs were supposed to avoid eating it, apart from as medicine for various complaints.

Yes, and for that, Atisha's three kinds of persons is a useful place to start.

In order to understand how to become a Dharma practitioner, we need to understand how it is that we are not, and then correct those deficiencies. We should not congratulate ourselves on being Dharma practitioners merely because we have taken an interest in Dharma and gone to visit some Lamas, and maybe even do a little meditation or mantra. If our goal is this life's happiness, we are not practicing Dharma no matter who we are or what high teachings we have taken. Ironically, this is true even if we accept rebirth, have received Dzogchen and Mahamudra teachings, and so on.

A psychologist, unless they are in fact a buddhist, will not have the proper background to deal with thus delusion. Plus, this is not Tibet or India where the soft approach will have much impact. I have seen a number of self-proclaimed tulkus lead their followers down pretty sordid roads. So, speaking as a westerner who has been in the Dharma for half of my life, and most of my adult life, it is better to nip this in the bud with a direct and decisive approach. Even, then, it relatively easy to get some Tibetan to sajy you are a tulku if you happen to display an aptitude for Dharma, and a bit of cash. 

For example, i have no memory of any past lives. But I can infer that I was some knd of practitioner in my past life due to the ease with which I met the Dharma and gurus in this life. But I am not a tulku, nor would I permit anyone to give me such a recognition for a couple of reasons. 

i have met a number of very sad individuals who have been very damaged by this fantasy, and others who used this fantasy to defraud others, and yet others who in my opinion use this idea that they are a tulku or emanation to expand their influence with the naive. 

This is not Tibet or India, where there is a proper structure for educating and training reincarnated lamas, as well as a cultural precedent for it. Every western Tibetan Buddhist has a past life connection with Tibet, so it is better to emphasize this, but discourage the idea that someone us a tulku. As you know, to be a real tulku you should be recognized when quite young.

We have a body of work, recognized by everyone, east and west, as being Nāgārjuna's authentic work. There are other texts which are under dispute and have been for centuries. Irrespective of the merits of Dharmadhātustava on its own, we really cannot accept it as representative of Nāgārjuna I's oeuvre or of his thought even if generations of Indians and Tibetans have accepted it as such. It does not necessarily mean it conflicts with Nāgārjuna's thought, but when this text is interpreted in such a way that to clearly does conflict with Nāgārjuna's thought, one cannot say, "This is how I am reading the Dharmadhātustava, and therefore this is what Nāgārjuna also maintained." 

For example, there is a way of understanding tathāgatagarbha that does not conflict with the main body of Buddhist thinking, and there is a way of understanding it that causes one to have wrong view.

Yogacara of Asanga is authentic Dharma, but I do not accept its ultimate conclusions; Abhidharma is authentic Dharma, but I do not accept is ultimate conclusions. Dharmadhātustava is an authentic Dharma text, but I certainly don't think we need to accept the claim it is a work of Nāgārjuna's and therefore consider it an authority that we need to take into account in order to take stock of Nāgājuna I's actual views on this and that. 

The point is that it is not representative of the thought of Nāgārjuna I, and when it is conflated with Nāgārjuna I's works, it creates interpretive problems and headaches that simply are not necessary and obscure things. 

Your analogy is not apt —&nbsp;it is not like there was a Nāgārjuna factory punching out texts branded "Nāgārjuna". 

As a text, it is important, especially in a Vajrayāna context, but it should be treated on its own, and not as an emblem of some hidden or esoteric allegiance to the tathāgatagarbha school on the part of Nāgārjuna numero uno. 

It is important to understand that Naropa thought it was a valid text of Nāgārjuna I, and to understand how that may have shaped his attitude towards things (less radically then you imagine), and so on. But clearly, despite Atisha's enthusiasm for it, he clearly understood it in light of Candrakīrti's approach to Madhyamaka. In other words, we need to understand this text, it's importance in formation of certain ideas because it was attributed to Nāgārjuna without conflating the text with Nāgārjuna's actual works. 

I have really tremendous respect for KB's scholarship, but somehow, I think he has an emotional relationship with gzhan stong that causes him to err in his estimation of certain texts, even when he writes very clearly on textual issues and brings out facts that very clearly contradict and repudiate the claims that gzhan stong scholars make.

Yes, Candra lists the praises, but does not detail this one. The earliest reference we have to the Dharmadhātustava being a composition of Nāgārjuna is by Dharmamitra (9th century, disciple of Haribhadra) in his Abhisamayālaṃkārakārikāprajñāpāramitopadeśaśāstraṭīkā prasphuṭapadā-nāma . Naropa considers it to be a composition of Nāgārjuna's, as does Atisha and Jagaddalanivāsin. However, a commentary on Hevajra Tantra, likely composed in the 12th century, cites a passage from the Dharmadhātustava, saying only that "some ārya said,"...." —&nbsp;this indicates to me some doubt in Indian circles as to the veracity of the source. 

So while of course there is a late tradition that this text was composed by Nāgārjuna dating from the ninth century (Dharmamitra), the absence of any reference to it all in earlier Madhyamaka sources, especially Candrakīrti, indicates it cannot be accepted as part of Nāgārjuna I's oeuvre. David Ruegg has also cast doubt on its composition, wondering at the fact that significant portions of it are reproduced in Atisha's Dharmadhātudarśanagīti which is included in the rgyud section of the bstan 'gyur, but I think Atisha was just riffing on it. 

Given that the fact that 10th-11th century Indians like Naropoa and Atisha accepted the Mulamadhyamaka-karikas and the Pañcakrama side by side as the work of the same Nāgārjuna, I think we can understand that they did not know how to distinguish the authentic works of Nāgārjuna I from works by later authors of the same name. 

Then there is the fact that the Dharmadhātustava was not translated into Tibetan until the 11th century ((like the Bodhicittavivarana and so on) by Kṛṣṇa Paṇḍita and Lotsawa Tsultrim Gyalwa, and I think we can understand this text was probably composed in early ninth century by the siddha Nāgārjuna. Also, if you examine carefully, you will find only that Candra mentions four praises as being authentic, these are the Lokakīta, Nirupamya, Acintya and Paramārthastavas. This does not mean these four are in fact compositions of Nāgārjuna, merely that they are a restricted list accepted by the middle period Madhyamikas (we can excluded the Madhyamakapradipa, because Bhavya and Bhavaviveka are different people).

Basically, what Śāntarakṣita is attempting to point out is that mind is a knower intrinsically, that it's capacity for knowing is an innate quality. This is somewhat in distinction with the idea that it is the meeting of a sense organ with a sense object that gives rise to a consciousness of a given object. 

One should contrast this with Candarkīrti and Śantideva's critiques of rang rig to fully understand the issue.

In other words, rang rig is merely a term for the clarity of consciousness, just as clarity is merely a term for the rang rig of consciousness. But it is clear from all of the places where Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla deal with the problem of rang rig, they reject they idea that it is a knower that is capable of taking itself as an object —&nbsp;which is the classic madhyamika objection to rang rig. Thus Śāntarakṣita is redefining rang rig for his own purposes as the mere clarity of consciousness in order differentiate consciousness from insentient phenomena such as rock, chariots, and walls. This must be understood to be distinct from the svasamvedana proposed by the Pramāṇavārttika and so on.

It is not talking about the nature of the mind in that sense. However, from a Madhyamaka point of view, one cannot separate a thing from its nature, for example, fire and heat are not two separate things, clarity and consciousness too are not separate things. Here, clarity, the nature of consciousness, is the knowing inherent to consciousness, which is what distinguishes consciousness from inert things like rocks, bricks and walls.

Title: Re: Gradual vs. Nongradual
Content:
Your second statement should be examined first —&nbsp;which svasamvedana is Śāntarakṣita advocating? 

What Śāntarakṣita says in fact about svasamvedana in the root text is only:

Because a tripartite nature cannot be accepted
in the nature of one partless [entity],
such a reflexive knower
is not an entity that has an action and and agent. 

Śāntarakṣita's auto-commentary states:

"Though a reflexive [intrinsic] knower is imputed in relative truth, it cannot withstand an analysis into one or many", thus [the issue] has been settled. 

He then defines an acceptable svasamvedana:

That being the case, the nature of intrinsic clarity that does not depend on another clarifier is the reflexive [intrinsic] knowing of consciousness.

Kamalaśīla's Madhyamakālaṃkārapañjikā supports this saying:

The concise meaning is that the function of reflexive [intrinsic] knowing is only to be the opposite of inert substances such as chariots, walls and so on. It is a convention for a clarity that does not depend on anything. 

And:

Due to the characteristic of reflexive [intrinsic] knowing being a mere entity of clarity, if there is an object that becomes the knower while it is being known, since this will consequently harm your claim for two aspects, you also cannot make such an assertion.

So this is quite a bit different than what most people take svasamvedana to mean. BTW, given this context, it is probably bad practice to define Śāntarakṣita's "rang rig", "svasamvedana" as either a "self-cognizing cognition" or a "reflexive knower", it is probably better to understand it as "intrinsic knowing", since that fits with how it is being defined above. 

Then, Śāntarakṣita states:

One should know that external entities 
do not exist based on mind-only;
based on this approach [tshul]
one can truly understand the absence of a self.

And comments:

Based on the approach of mind-only, it is easy to understand the absence of nature [niḥsvabhāva] of I and mine, apprehending subject and apprehended object and so on, asserted as external to a concomitant mind. Since this approach is the non-existence of self-origination, that mind is also understood to be without nature. When this middle path free of all extremes is understood, the freedom from having a nature of one or many is truly understood as the absence of a nature.  

In terms of the two approaches, it is true that Śāntarakṣita states:

Having mounted the chariot of the two approaches,
holding the reins of reasoning, 
in just that way therefore, they 
will obtain the Mahāyāna. 

But it never clearly specified that he is combining Asanga and Nāgārjuna's system. In his auto-commentary, all that is said about this is a citation from the Lanka:

The Mahāyāna is included in two approaches. The brief explanation follows:

Five dharmas, three natures, 
eight consciousnesses, 
and two selflessness
encompass the entire Mahāyāna.

Kamalaśīla's Madhyamakālaṃkārapañjikā does however state pretty clearly that the two approaches are Madhyamaka and Yogacara. He expands on the list given in the Lanka as well. 

But which Yogacara is Kamalaśīla referring to? It is pretty clear that Śāntarakṣita is not basing himself upon the Yogacara of Asanga and so on that, but rather the Yogacara of the Lanka and other related sūtras. 

So, when I said there is no common ground, this is perhaps a bit of an overstatement, but what I really mean is that Śāntarakṣita is not basing himself on the treatises of the Yogacara masters.

He asserts that while some say that the ultimate is non-origination, he prefers to describe it as inexpressible. But this is not a "positive affirmation to express the absolute."

This is all Śāntarakṣita says about the ultimate:

Therefore, the Tathāgatas have said
all phenomena have not arisen
because it corresponds with ultimate truth —
this is called "the ultimate truth."
Due to the absence of arising and so on, 
nonarising and so on are impossible. 
Due the negation of that [nonarising], 
words for it are not possible. 

He states quite clearly and plainly that nonarising was is taught by the Buddhas because it corresponds with ultimate truth. He then further examines nonarising and establishes it too is impossible in absence of something which arose, and that impossibility is inexpressible, there are no words for it.

Yes, Georges Dumezil has the most convincing explanation of these issues, his comparative mythology is based on linguistic diffusion and he focused on the triparte social structure of Indo-European societies — seminal texts of his included Mitra and Varuna, and so on. See also Puhvel, Jaan. Comparative Mythology. Baltimore 1987.

Destiny of a King is indeed also one of his seminal and important books.

Text criticism can only tell you what is in one text as opposed to another version of the same text, it might show progressive development, for example, then again, it might not.

But I do read what you and many other secular scholars write, like Donald Lopez for example, and I can say with great confidence that you are not writing about Buddhadharma. You are all writing about a corpse you call "Buddhism". No one is going to attain awakening by reading your articles, nor are they going to attain awakening by reading Wedemeyer's book mentioned above, no matter how intellectually interesting they may be. 

My statements are completely fair, and are based on having studied Buddhadharma as well as what passes for scholarship on Buddhism for as long as you have been alive. My skepticism about scholarship on Buddhism is well earned. What's more, scholarship on Buddhism has become more of an exercise in knowing the opinions of other westerners about this or that thing than it is knowing in depth the thing itself.

History is not the discipline of "dating" the past (that's what Archaeology is for), but it definitely is the art of explaining the past, and more importantly, putting the past into context for the modern day. 

This why the goals and aims of historians of Buddhadharma should be very different than the goals and aims of those who seek to write histories of Buddhism. The former are concerned with giving context to the Buddhadharma for those who live in the present day and age, where the latter merely seek to write down, as best they can, and without hope for much accuracy, a progression of events and persons.

I checked the sutra in question in the Tibetan translation. It is not exactly the six and fifth bodhisattva bhumi. Here is another passage which clarifies things:

It is talking about equivalent stages of the eradication of afflictions in this case. 

Other than the view of the abhisamaya of the śravakas abandoning fully the afflictions on the sixth or fifth stage, the latent afflictions are not abandoned and they have inconceivable deaths and transmigrations. They proclaim My births are finished, I abide in brahmacarya, my work is finished", uttering the lion's roar. Having said that, after they become throughly familiar with the absence of self in persons, their minds turn a period of nirvana.

What is here being stated is that that śravakas abandonment of active afflictions is equivalent to that of the fifth or sixth bhumi, but that they do not abandon latent afflictions and are thus subject to inconceivable deaths and transmigrations. 

Another section, dealing with bhumis, states:

Beginning with the sixth stage, bodhisattva mahasattvas, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas enter into the concentration on cessation. On the seventh stage, mental moment by mental moment, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas enter into a concentration that eliminates the characteristics of all things, but the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not. The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas' concentration on cessation falls into the characteristics of an apprehended object and apprehending subject through possession of ideation. That being the case, if the characteristic of the absence of the different dharma's they obtain and the characteristic of diversity were to become non-existent, it would not be proper — on the seventh bhumi one is to concentrate on one mental moment after another. They enter into concentration without comprehending the intrinsic characteristic of the virtue and nonvirtue of all phenomena. That being the case, such a one who enters into concentration is not skilled in entering into concentration on one mind moment after another.

The point is the comparison with the concentrations, abandonments and so on of śravakas and pratyekabuddhas with bodhisattvas on the stages. It is not an assertion that śravakas and pratyekabuddhas are traversing the stages.

No one every said gzhan stong was a hindu heresy —&nbsp;well, the Sakya master Rendawa did (Tsongkhapa's teacher)— but another Sakya master, Rongton, rejected that charge as too harsh, stating that gzhan stong was a transitional view between Yogacara and Madhyamaka. 

Some masters at Nalanda would have liked the gzhan stong view just fine, masters like the false-aspectarian Yogacara master Ratnakarashanti for example (upon whose writing gzhan stong is in fact largely based, even if this is unacknowledged.) 

The main difference between the Indians and people like Dudjom Rinpoche is that the former made no effort to try and locate their view in the so called three turnings, because in fact the Indians simply did not understand the three turnings in the way it was later interpreted by generations of Chinese Buddhists, as well as Kagyus and Nyingmapas.

But he isn't discounted at all. But he was not the only amazing Nyingma Lama with a large following in the late 20th century. However, his being the head of Nyingma was only relevant in the exile community. 

You also seem to be confused about the difference between institutional curriculum and individual authors. And as I pointed out to you, neither his son nor his grandson follow his views of Madhyamaka.

No, my point is that your campaign to somehow enshrine Dudjom Rinpoche's perspective as the definitive view of Nyingma is an epic fail. His perspective is definitive for those Nyingmapas who choose to follow it, just as Mipham's is for those Nyingmapas who choose to follow it. 

I will point out, however, that Dudjom Rinpoche's book is not used as part of the curriculum at Namdroling Monastery in South India (Palyul), not is it part of the curriculum at Larung Gar in Tibet (the largest Nyingma Institution in the world), nor is it on the curriculum of Mindroling in North India, nor Dzogchen Monastery, nor Kathog, nor Dorje Drag nor Sechen. It forms no part of the curriculum at the six main Nyingma monasteries, so how can it be regarded as definitive by anyone? 

This is not to say it is not a wonderful book, since it is, but it does not trump Mipham, Longchenpa and Rongzom. 

Now, I have wasted enough time with you on your obsession, and frankly I have better things to do.

I am sure that Dudjom Rinpoche was quite aware of it, even if you are not. As I have pointed out to you, the translator Kawa Paltseg refers to "freedom from extremes" as Great Madhyamaka, as does the Sakya Gongma, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen.  Also the Gelugpas like to call Tsongkhapa's version of Madhyamaka, "Great Madhyamaka".

So in reality, all three major trends of "Madhyamaka" in Tibet refer to themselves as "Great".

If you wish to see how it is used by the Sakyapas, I refer to to my blog post here:

Likewise, the nirmanakaya buddha arises from his own past aspirations as well as the needs of other sentient beings, and he therefore appears without "deliberate effort." You are reading way too much into "self-originated".

Oh, it is not that. Sakyapas have a completely different line of transmission than the Kagyus. The Kagyu line is Naropa, Maitripa, Marpa, etc. The Sakya line is Naropa, Phaimthing brothers, the translator Sherab Tseg, Mal lotsawa, Sachen, etc. 

Note, that the order I give above it not as sequential as it seems. Not only was Marpa held to be a disciple of Maitripa, from whom the main stream of the Sahaja Mahamudra tradition so held to come from (bypassing Naropa entirely), but also Marpa is held to have encountered Naropa personally. 

Mal Lotsawa was not only a direct disciple of Sherab Tseg, but he also received all of the transmissions for Cakrasamvara and Vajrayogini directly from the elder Phaimthing.

Now, it is true that some Sakyas have expressed doubt over whether Marpa directly met Naropa in person, but what should Kagyus care about what some Sakyas think? Likewise, some Sakyas have expressed doubts about whether the Mañjuśrī Lama Tsongkhapa encountered through the mediumship of Lama Umapa was authentic or not, but again, why should Gelugpas care about what some Sakya guy thinks? For example, Taranatha roundly criticizes the Padma Khathang literature in the introduction to Padmsambhava's life story as told by his Indian Guru, Buddhaguptanatha. But why should Nyingmapas care about what some Jonangpa guy thinks? Likewise, Dudjom Rinpoche claims that Lamdre really comes from the Heruka Galpo tantra, a tantra of Yangdag, but in reality, why should Sakypas care what some Nyingmapa guy thinks? You see, it goes on and on like this. 

A final example, I have shown really quite well that the thee turnings of the wheel doctrine favored by Nyingmas, Kagyus and Jonangpas really has been employed in a way completely without any consistency with what the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra actually says about it, and have pointed out that in Indian texts there was a complete lack of interest in this idea, and that the source of making fine distinctions about them all stem from a Korean commentary that was translated into Tibetan in the early ninth century. Even though I am very firmly convinced that the way Longchenpa, the Third Karmapa, Buton, Dolbupa, and so on have used this brief statement as a hermeneutical key for unlocking the meaning of the sutras (albeit in very distinct ways) is based on a total mistaken understanding, still, in reality, what do Kagyus, Nyingmapas and Jonangpas care about what some Sakya guy has to say about it? It is sufficient merely to say Kagyu, Nyingma and Jonang hold the three turnings of the wheel as very important; the Gelugpas maintain that the second turning is definitive; and the Sakyapas think that the three turning of the wheel doctrine is totally misunderstood, and even so, it is not very important at all, and that if you assert that it actually refers to three historical epochs in the Buddha's teachings, you wind up with all sorts of knotty contradictions that turn the Buddha into a liar. 

In general, the mature point of view is that all lineages have their own narratives, which are to be given respect, even if there is some disagreement about the particulars. That way, everyone's sweaters remain whole, even though they might require darning from time to time.

Destroying a sweater defeats the value of the garment. Likewise, if you poke and pull enough doubt may be cast on any narrative, but these narratives are the protective garments of traditions, and unravelling them is destructive.

As to point two: virtually all Tibetan Buddhists, apart from small children, have received major empowerments, and thus hold three vows. They are therefore Vajrayānists. 

As to point two, it may be the case that Vajrayāna historically spread to Śri Lanka, Java, China, etc. But apart from Japan, the only place where Vajrayāna is practiced as a primary form of Buddhism is Tibet, Mongolia and the Himalayas, and in communities in India and abroad started by Tibetan exiles. Some might want to include Tendai under the rubric of Vajrayāna but I would not since Tendai subordinates Vajrayāna to sūtra. Shingon however is a Vajrayāna tradition.

It may have been debated in numerous different factions, but so what? That merely shows that a) there was a guy named Huineng, b) he transmitted Chan and was a patriarch c) was sufficiently important that people took a stake in various oral histories that surrounded him. 

It does not mean however that Huineng never existed, was never an important lineage master, and that all lineages of Chan/Zen surviving today do not come from this single root. 

Let me give you another example —&nbsp;the famed Mahāsiddha, Naropa. There are two versions of his story, the Kagyu version where it is reported by Gampopa that Naropa realized mahāmudra, and the Sakya version where it is reported that Naropa did not realize mahāmudra (despite the fact that Naropa's Vajrayogini is among the most profound Sakya transmissions). There are some other differences between the early Sakya accounts of Naropa and Gampopa's account, but the key point is this: Tilopa is recorded by both traditions as having commanded Naropa to give up the accouterments of a Pandita and to adopt the accouterments of a yogi. He was also ordered by Tilopa to desist from debates. Upon his return from his years of study with Tilopa, Naropa took up residence near Nalanda. Some tīrthikas were giving the four gate-keepers of Nalanda a run for their money and the king asks Naropa to intercede. Naropa agrees but finds he is unable to adequately debate the Hindus (perhaps because his scholarship was rusty from his years of serving Tiloopa). Tilopa arrives to save the day, and scolds Naropa for his disobedience. The key difference between these two early accounts is that in the Sakya account, Tilopa is recorded as having predicted that Naropa himself will be unable to realize Mahāmudra for disobeying his guru. Therefore, in the Sakyapa tradition it is a matter of record that Naropa did not realize Mahāmudra. In the Kagyu traditon it is matter of record that he did. Which tradition is correct? Who cares? One follows the tradition to which one belongs.

It is best not to conflate systems. Of course, now, someone is going to fabricate a Vajrayāna Reiki, invent an empowerment for it and so on, it is only a matter of time...

No, this is not the case. For a person who has not received abhisheka there is no connection, no dependent origination has been established, and so on. 

Reiki is not and never will be a Vajrayāna system of any kind.

It is not a false dichotomy —&nbsp;forensics is dissection. You only do that to corpses. One does not dissect living things, unless one is seeking to remove some illness from them in order to save their lives. 

One might argue that Buddhology is just such a kind of surgery, but in general, in surgery, the surgeon has to be interested in saving the patient, and in the case of people like Jayarava, etc., I see no such interest at all. They merrily hack away at the body of Dharma, trying to remove what they perceive to problems and inconsistencies, blind to the problems and inconsistencies they themselves are introducing ——&nbsp;this is, in all cases, because they have not received a proper education in Dharma, and properly followed a master. There is no one more sad than a putative Dharma practitioner who has no master. 

One can try to couch the various approaches in the modern historiography of Buddhadharma in "neutral" distinctions such as "etic" and "emic", but these terms are merely subtle insults — at least the way the terms are commonly misapplied in Buddhology these days. 

In terms of so called "Early Buddhism", this is merely a hypothetical Buddhism, a largely speculative project of reconstruction. No one ever practiced, practices or can practice such a thing as "Early Buddhism" because there is actually no such thing and there never was such a thing. One can only practice the Dharma one has received from a teacher in the present day along with its traditions and lineages and that is all.

Rechungpa's dates are 1085-- 1161. Nyang ral, born in 1124, would have been 37 when Raschung passed. Nyang had a student called man lung pa mi bskyod rdo rje, birth dates unknown, so it is possible that Raschungpa received this transmission from this Mikyo Dorje. Nyang's lineage, the five deity mandala, has the mantra found in the Siddhirajñī text.

Gyalwa Gyatso also has no named text in the bka' 'gyur nor the bstan 'gyur. 

However a quick search shows that one version of Gyalwa Gyatso uses the mantra in the Siddhirajni text. Another version, in the bcom ldan 'das 'phags pa 'jig rten dbang phyug rgyal ba rgya mtsho'i sgrub dkyil dbang chog dang bcas pa thar pa'i lam chen zhes bya ba found in the Sakya Rgyud sde kun btus shows the mantra in given in the first text I described above. So it seems that this form of Avalokiteśvara practice got its nickname in Tibet. 

The rgyud sde kun btus lists two different lineages for the practice. 

First, goes from Vajradhara, to Avalokiteśvara, Padmavajra the junior, Jalandhara, Vajrapani, Maitripa, Vajrapani, Sumatikirti, Rechungpa, etc. —&nbsp;I think this is the one practiced in Kagyu.

The second, from Amitabha, to Avalokiteśvara, Mitrajoki, Śrīputra, Minyag Dragpa Rinchen and so on. This one does not have an important lineage.

The full mandala of Yogini has 37 deities. The full mandala of Cakrasamvara has 62 deities. What is the difference? The absence of the heroes. When you subtract the 25 heroes from 62 you come up with 37. Then of course, the essential or mandala of great bliss of Cakrasamvara is Cakramsavara/Vārāhī and the four core dākinīs, Lāma and so on. When you are dealing with just the core deities of Vārāhī, then you have Vārāhī, Lāma, etc. Or you can take it down to one deity, like Naropa's Khecari. But all in all, even the single deity Naropa's Khecari actually contains the entire 62 deity Samvara mandala.

Incidentally, any mantra with ha ri ni sa in it has a Nyingma origin since that mantra is entirely absent in any Sarma tantra.

The difference lies in whether the essence and near essence mantras are combined, as in the Om gsum mantra, or whether they are kept separately, as in some other sadhanas and transmissions. 

The main point however is that we have two basic forms of one deity. For example, there is a Cakrasamvara in his Sahaja form, 12 armed form, up to a thousand armed form. They are all different forms of the same deity. Likewise, whether we are talking about Naro Dakini, Indradakini (Vārāhī), Maitri Dakini, or Vajravārāhī they are all different forms of the same deity. 

In the sadhanas we have in the bstan 'gyur we frequently see this:

/bod skad du/rdo rje phag mo'i sgrub thabs/dpal rdo rje rnal 'byor ma la phyag 'tshal lo/

/bod skad du/rdo rje rnal 'byor ma'i sgrub thabs zhes bya ba/rje btsun dpal rdo rje phag mo la phyag 'tshal lo/

In Tibetan: Vajravārāhīsadhana. Homage to Vajrayoginī. 

In Tibetan: Vajrayoginīsadana. Homage to Lady Śrī Vajravārāhī


Or in the Khyāvajravārāhyabhidhanāta-tantrottara-vārāhi-abhibodhiya-nāma

Arising in the center of that is the queen, 
Vārāhī, Vajrayoginī.

My point being is that these two terms are both used for the same deity, regardless of minor differences in mantra formation or appearances.

The presence or absence of the sows head is not relevant. What is relevant is that the mantras are the same, the source tantra is the same, and so on. 

Also, Yoginī is the essence of Cakrasamvara. When one practices Yoginī, Samvara is included automatically. The arrangement of the mandala is the same, the manner of the abhisamaya is the same, based on the Yoginīsaṃcarya Tantra, so on and so forth. 

Also, when in union with Cakrasamvara, Vajravārāhī is never pictured with a sow's head, as she is always, say, when she is the consort of Hayagriva in Nyingma Tantras. 

This is why I am willing to allow that Vajravārāhī in Nyingma is not necessarily interchangeable with Vajrayoginī in Sarma —&nbsp;the Vajravārāhī mantras in Nyingma tantra are not similar at all with the Yoginī/Vārāhī mantras from the Laghusamvara.

Always, they both come from the Laghusamvara Tantra, and no distinction is made between Yoginī and Vārāhī, Vajrayoginī is Vajravārāhī and vice verse. The only difference between them is the source of the lineage, but not the nature of the deity.

Of course, a dharmapāla, as opposed to a lokapāla, is an awakened nonhuman manifesting in a wrathful form to protect the Dharma. A lokapāla is a worldly being who has been bound to protect the Dharma. It is important to make this distinction since it is at the root of the dharmapāla crisis in Gelug.

Since when are Dharmapālas "spirits", two, since when do Dharmapālas take interest in the affairs of mortals? Third, how are we to know whether this guidance was from a dharmapāla or a māra masquerading as a dharmapāla?
