The nine examples have both a definitive understanding, compatible with prasanga, and an understanding that is an atmavada at worst, and false aspectarian yogacara at best.

Nonsense. 

However, when people wish to discuss tenets, they have to do better than just quote some passage from some past scholar and expect the conversation is over, and they have to admit when they have been caught in classical contradictions which have been pointed out by other past scholars. I personally don’t care about theses debates, but if someone asserts, incorrectly, that gzhan stong view is compatible with Dzogchen, I will reject this  because it is a false statement. Not only this, but I have heard ChNN state this point will absolute clarity on many occasions with my own ears. The only Madhyamaka view ChNN stated, and even written about, that was absolutely compatible with Dzogchen is the prasanga view, echoing Longchenpa.

Care to quote me a book and page number? Because in fact ChNN stated that they were incompatible over the point of whether or not qualities were fully formed in the basis or not. In Dzogchen, those qualities are not fully formed in the basis. 

Further, Dzogchen does not make use of three own natures. So, I’ll be waiting on those references.

The Sound Tantra itself is basically a long but terse list. However, the commentary unpacks it nicely, and very clearly. I am more than halfway through the root text and commentary, and expect to be done with the draft by next summer. Wisdom has agreed to publish it in principle, so it will be available to practitioners. And I will be explaining portions of it before publication for those who are interested.

Dzogchen tantras can be a challenge to understand without commentaries, but with commentaries not so hard.

I am not shutting down gzhan stong pas. They are free to say whatever they like. I have no power to control them, so stop acting like I do. 

When it come to gzhan stong and Nyingma, apart from a handful of writers in the Nyingma school who adhered to to it, beginning in the 18th century, it was not a popular view in Nyingma. It was first popularized in Eastern Tibet among the Karma Kagyus, from whom it spread into some quarters of the Nyingma school via Kongtrul’s influence. 

Rongzom would have rejected it. Longchenpa explicitly rejected it, as did Mipham, Khenpo Zhenga, and so on. Among those modern Dzogchen teachers who flat out rejected the compatibility of gzhan stong and Dzogchen view was Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, our own teacher, who mentioned this point many times. I imagine Khenchen Namdrol also rejects it, as his personal point of view is aligned with Gorampa, at least that’s what he told me thirty years ago (Gorampa = Dzogchen, was basically what he said).

Assuming you are referring to disagreement over the three natures , you will have to read Tsongkhapa, Gorampa, etc.

Arguing that gzhan stong is a golden age doctrine is among those absurd criteria. The fact that the gzhan stong pa incorrectly apply the three natures in a manner in utter inconsistent with how they are explained in the foundational documents of the yogacara school, while simultaneously insisting that everyone else has it wrong is another.

I’ve read Dolbupa, in translation and in Tibetan, as well as his detractors. I stand by my comment. Dolbupa reasonings are not very convincing, and are based on many absurd criterias.

Point of fact, he didn’t. And the fact is that gzhan stong pas here are incapable of responding with anything that isn’t just a morass of incoherent assertions lacking reasoning, more or less like Dolbuwa.

My point was that people repeatedly use this citation as a proof text for their own arguments, like three vows did, without understanding the proof text itself is faulty. My point had nothing to do with DR’s understanding of Madhyamaka. That’s a separate issue. But because people get hysterical whenever it is pointed out that a famous master’s writing contains faulty reasonings or citations, it is hard to have a rational discussion about this fact because Tibetan Buddhists are heavily invested in personality cults.

The point as addressed at the notion that prasanga and svatantra were Outer madhyamaka, while gzhan stong was inner, orbgreat madhyamaka. The original citation mentions nothing about all three Tibetan denominated systems, which were never known to Indians.

That’s not what I meant, but my post was incomplete. What I meant was that people who don’t work with Tibetan texts directly often do not understand patterns of textual citation in Tibetan traditions.

It most certainly is the citation DR received, it’s not something he invented. This is very common. People who don’t actually work with Tibetan texts.

If you are claiming there is direction introduction in sutra, then this is incorrect. If you are claiming the nature of mind is pointed out in the third turning but not in the second, this is also incorrect.
