Also this other Buddhist flag (the one designed by Olcott), this is also not real. Just politics."

These all possess objects, no? 

Appearances can not be found, on analysis. So we term them “clearly apparent nonexistents.” 

Delusion has two levels: delusion about appearances and essences. 

Generally, we are working with the delusion about essences, whether appearances exist according to any of the four extremes. 

In order to work with the delusion about essences, first we must remove delusion about appearances.

People with secure attachment are far more likely to be able to understand emptiness as a remedy to their afflictive states than those who cannot even begin to perceive they are in an intensified state of affliction (psychotic break) to begin with. 

In any case, no one meditates on emptiness directly. As you allude to, one meditates on appearances, and tries to discern their nature through analytical reasoning. That's not what we do in Vajrayāna, as well as Dzogchen, but that is what people do in sūtra.

In one of the few cases where I have been asked to intervene with someone who was on the verge of a such a break, the best option for them, rather than Buddhist philosophy, was to remind them that they had a loving wife, whom they needed to trust, and that if she insisted that something was the case that contradicted the delusion they were experiencing, they should trust her and not the delusion (this person was stuck in the Descarte's demon trap). I am not convinced Buddhist philosophy is the best solution for a person who is spinning out. But what do I know, I am not a shrink.

Hi Kurt:

The main issue, as I see it at present, is editing machine-generated texts, reviewing them for sense, idiom, etc. For Tibetan especially, given the huge amount of homophony and scarcity of synonyms, Tibetan texts would need more oversight in the short term. I am sure eventually however, machine-generated translations will become normative.

We use machines for generating prayers, I don't see any real ethical concerns with dharma translations in this respect.

I would not be so hasty. Mipham's commentary on the Cultivation of Bodhicitta, when discussing the nonexistence of buddhahood, states:

[Root] Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion. 

[Commentary] Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparition, while a false appearance, appears to the deluded, similar to an illusion. 


[Root] Likewise, the pure pristine consciousnesses that are a stream of utter virtue 
and the arising of their perceptions of the dharmadhātu itself are to be investigated.
Because the vajra has no basis and mutual existence [is not established], the nature is similar;
and as there is no partiality for those [pure pristine consciousnesses] — the dharmadhātu, the vajra, and the pinnacle— there are no moments.


[Commentary] Likewise, when those nonconceptual, pure gnoses that are a stream of limitless roots of utter virtue and the unmistaken dharmadhātu that gives rise to the perceptions of those gnoses are analytically investigated, they are not established. In this way, because the basis or cause of that vajra, nonconceptual gnosis, does not exist in the mind, there is also no resultant gnosis. Therefore, since their mutual existence is not established, they become similar in every respect to the nature of the mind that is not established and are the same. The assertion of the Vijñāptivadins that gnosis is ultimate is also not established. The vajra-like gnosis that realizes the dharmadhātu is the pinnacle of all gnosis. Since they do not perceive any partiality at all, those gnoses are not momentary."

And:

[Root] The root of pure virtue [is similar to] a reflection. Since [the root of pure virtue] does not exist, mundane gnosis also does not exist.

[Commentary] The root of the pure virtue of the three wheels is similar to a reflection. Since [the root of pure virtue] does not truly exist, the pure, mundane gnosis which depends on that also does not exist.

Also Rongzom's view of this depends on Mañjuśrīmitra, as does Longchenpa's view, as well as being one more point which shows that gzhan stong is not compatible with Dzogchen teachings.

All markets have always been regulated. The central role of government, as mentioned above, is the regulation and protection of markets. Markets are idiots, they are not intelligent, and this is demonstrably shown time and again:

Liberal writers like Spencer and Sumner, Mises and Lippmann offer an account of the double movement substantially similar to our own, but they put an entirely different interpretation on it. While in our view the concept of a self-regulating market was utopian, and its progress was stopped by the realistic self-protection of society, in their view all protectionism was a mistake due to impatience, greed, and shortsightedness, but for which the market would have resolved its difficulties. The question as to which of these two views is correct is perhaps the most important problem of recent social history, involving as it does no less than a decision on the claim of economic liberalism to be the basic organizing principle in society. Before we turn to the testimony of the facts, a more precise formulation of the issue is needed.

Polanyi, Karl. The Great Transformation (p. 148). Beacon Press. Kindle Edition. 

And:

Finally, the behavior of liberals themselves proved that the maintenance of freedom of trade—in our terms, of a self-regulating market—far from excluding intervention, in effect, demanded such action, and that liberals themselves regularly called for compulsory action on the part of the state as in the case of trade union law and anti-trust laws. Thus nothing could be more decisive than the evidence of history as to which of the two contending interpretations of the double movement was correct: that of the economic liberal who maintained that his policy never had a chance, but was strangled by shortsighted trade unionists, Marxist intellectuals, greedy manufacturers, and reactionary landlords; or that of his critics, who can point to the universal “collectivist” reaction against the expansion of market economy in the second half of the nineteenth century as conclusive proof of the peril to society inherent in the utopian principle of a self-regulating market.

There is no longer a road to “socialism” anywhere. And yes, he is describing modern political economy. You need to get with it and cease relying  on the outdated views of political economists of the past. Milanovich goes over their errors and their inability to predict the rise of political capitalism. Like most libertarians, you’ve betrayed your hand by admitting that “rule by elites” isn’t that bad. That’s the “proto-communist policies” Milanovich points out is a result of the libertarian small state. Nozick too is smart, but not that smart.

You better read Milanovic’s two books, the first on globalism, the second, Capitalism, Alone. He concludes the latter book with this final paragraph:

If liberal capitalism were to evolve toward political capitalism, it would display all or most of the features that I discussed in Chapter 3. A very effective management of the economy would be required to produce the relatively high growth rates that would keep the population satisfied; an efficient bureaucracy would be needed to implement such measures; and there would be an increase in intrinsic corruption that can always, in the long term, present a threat to the survival of a regime.

Milanovich disagrees. Libertarianism of the Mises variety ultimately leads to this:

The more economic and political power in liberal capitalism become united, the more liberal capitalism becomes plutocratic and comes to resemble political capitalism. In the latter, political control is the way to acquire economic benefits; in plutocratic, formerly liberal, capitalism, economic power is used to conquer politics. The end point of the two systems becomes the same: unification and persistence of the elites. 

Elites may also believe that they are able to run society more effectively by using the technocratic toolkit of political capitalism. A transition toward political capitalism could be boosted if young people became increasingly disenchanted by mainstream parties that follow more or less the same policies, and consequently lost hope that democratic processes could lead to meaningful change. The objective of political capitalism is to take politics out of people’s minds, which can be more easily done when disenchantment and lack of interest in democratic politics are high.

Mises, Hayek, Rawls, etc., were unequipped to imagine political capitalism; they imagined, wrongly, that capitalism and democracy were coterminous. Demonstrably, they are not.

In any case, he discusses gnosis in his  Yuktiṣaṣṭikāvṛtti a bit more than in his other texts, apart from the MAV commentary (where there are 18 references to all-knowledge, 107 references to gnosis (jnāna) of various kinds, and so on). An essential component of nondual gnosis for Candra is compassion, etc.

The former guy proved that the world was not ready for "peace." The minute he went about dismantling 75 years of diplomatic consensus, that was when the world started to move out of balance. Of course we can discuss the travesty of Iraq, Obama's timidity with respect to Syria and Russia, etc. But the present state of affairs is a direct result of TFG's incompetence in governance and affection for dictators. Thankfully, Biden, drawing on his 45 years in the house, senate, and time as VP, was able to reforge NATO, and because of Putin's folly, made it even stronger. Under his guidance, the US economy is very strong, inflation is under control, there are massive infrastructure projects all over the US, etc. 

RFK has absolutely no experience in government, believes in strange things like 5G being a existential threat to everything, etc. The problem with Kennedy is not that he is completely crazy——he has worked for many things I believe strongly, indigenous rights, and so on. The problem with the guy is that he does not have an evidence-based view of many things. He has zero understanding of the Ukraine situation, thinks vaccines cause autism, etc. The list of bad ideas to which he is addicted is rather lengthy. Basically, the dude is a casualty of 1960's. 

Finally, the idea that JFK was iced by the CIA is complete bollocks, just laughable, and the idea that if elected, he would suffer the same fate, equally febrile.

Tell me you don't understand inflation without telling me you do not understand inflation:

The dollar had an average inflation rate of 1.44% per year between 1801 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 2,294.70%. This means that today's prices are 23.95 times as high as average prices since 1801, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer price index.

Umm, no, what you are saying is bullshit. 

Taxation is not "robbing" people. In fact, during the period of the strongest economic growth in the US, the marginal tax rate for the wealthiest was, in 2020 dollars, 91% over 2 million in income. If you can't live on 2 million dollars a year, you are a total loser. This rate encouraged business growth. 

When you account for all taxes, as professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Sucman did in their book, “The Triumph of Injustice,” the overall tax system in America is nearly flat, and the 400 taxpayers at the very top — billionaires, that is — pay the lowest overall rate. It was factual, not “demagoguery,” as some have charged, for President Biden to say that billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. 

No, America doesn’t drain the affluent. But the highly affluent — particularly, the top 1 percent — sure are draining the rest of us.

If 400 people want to leave the US, that's fine with me. The rest of us will do quite ok.

If you examine the Ratnavali, for example, you will discover that Nāgārjuna recommended universal health care, eliminating capital punishment, etc. The Buddha himself advocated for socially liberal policies——indeed, Buddha probably invented CRT when he castigated the varna system as a form of structural racism in Indian society, admitted women to the ordained Sangha and so on. In response, Buddhism met with strongest resistance from the Conservative element of Indian society, brahmins, who followd the Laws of Manu, etc. Thus, it is really no surprise whatsoever that Buddhism is popular amongst Liberals. Buddhism is not popular with the Left however, who generally follow some sort of materialist leanings, a hang over from Marx. 

Thus, Buddhism is an inherently liberal doctrine, unlike Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Confuscism, Taoism, and so on. As Aryadeva points out, kings are fools.

This does happen, and it is either a sign of lack of faith or merit in the student. In this case, they should probably move on to a different teacher.

It's understandable, since the whole Burisma thing is a puton, found to be baseless by DOJ during the former adminstration:

Representative James R. Comer, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the Oversight Committee, made the announcement after summoning F.B.I. officials to Capitol Hill for a closed-door briefing on a document containing an unverified allegation of bribery against Mr. Biden when he was vice president. The Trump Justice Department investigated the allegation, which involved his son Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine, in 2020, but prosecutors could not substantiate the claims, according to two people familiar with the matter...“What we’re talking about is secondhand hearsay,” Mr. Raskin said, adding, “That confidential human source said that he had no way of knowing about the underlying veracity of the things that he was being told...Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York and a member of the Oversight Committee who examined allegations against Mr. Biden and Burisma as part of a House impeachment team in 2019, said the Republican narrative had fallen flat because Mr. Biden sought to crack down on corruption in Ukraine, not enable it.

“The facts are actually directly contrary to any of the Republican allegations,” Mr. Goldman said.”

Like any empowerment, active participation is required on the part of both teacher and student. So, no, one cannot give direct introduction to someone who is completely intoxicated. 

If one understands the meaning and symbolism of that syllable, yes, that's all one needs. The job of a teacher is to explain that meaning and symbolism to the student. 

Mind (sems) and pristine consciousness (ye shes),
are neither the same nor different.
They are phenomena that are difficult to differentiate.
The mind is the potential (rtsal) of pristine consciousness.
The basis of the mind is pristine consciousness.
Therefore, since mind and pristine consciousness
are both the same and different,
there is so-called liberation and nonliberation

That's not actually true, theoretically or actually:

Here, however, the transformation from feudalism to capitalism took place under the control of an extremely powerful state, a different process from what happened in Europe and North America, where the role of the state was much less important and where countries were free of foreign interference.20 But this is a fundamental difference; and this difference in the role of the state explains why capitalism in China, Vietnam, and many other places, either in the past (South Korea) or currently (Ethiopia, Rwanda), has so often had an authoritarian edge to it.

The argument that communism was the system that enabled the transition from feudalism to indigenous capitalism in countries that were colonized or dominated by the West is also supported by the fact that communism was more successful in less-developed countries. When we measure the success of communism either by a crude growth rate or, preferably, by comparing the performance of communist countries against capitalist countries at the same level of development, we find a negative correlation between the income level of a country at the time when it became communist and its subsequent absolute growth rate, or its growth rate relative to its capitalist counterparts. In simple terms, this means that communism was least successful in developed industrial economies like East Germany and Czechoslovakia and most successful in poor agricultural societies like China and Vietnam.

Rig pa and mind are neither the same nor different. Even if you did not discover the “meaning wisdom” in a direct introduction, you still have the “example wisdom.” Of course a proper teacher is always communicating direct introduction from the perspective of the meaning wisdom, so anyone who participates has received all three transmissions-aural, symbolic, and direct-whether they recognized the direct transmission or not.
