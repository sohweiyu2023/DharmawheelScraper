Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in SE Asia were based on Indian Buddhism spreading to the east. Their scriptures were in Sanskirt, as is the case with Mahāyāna that spread to China and Tibet. It has never been the case that the scriptures of any branch of Theravada were based in Sanskrit.

I absolutely disagree. There can be no Vajrayāna without well established Mahāyāna traditions. Calling folk magic practices "tantric" practices is just a way of discrediting Vajrayāna by associating it with popular magical practices found in Thailand etc.

Unlike Theravada, Tibetan Buddhism's meditative traditions were never interrupted, necessitating a revival. We can trace with certainty the entry point of every lineage into Tibet from late 8th century onward. The situation on the ground in India between is a little messier. Theravadin schools apparently cannot make this claim for continuity due to a number of the factors.

No, this is not a standard Sakya view. 

The standard Sakya view is that arhats are not reborn anywhere. They remain in a samadhi of cessation (the samadhi body), similar to formless realm beings. They are indeed revived from this samadhi of cessation to continue on the bodhisattva path, starting from the beginning on the path of accumulation.

Buton's views on this and that are not main stream Sakya.

If you are referring to the practice of śamatha-bhāvana, etc., it is true that as of the late 19th century, the practice of meditation had died out completely in Śrī Lanka. 

It appears that in Burma the practice of meditation in general was revived towards the end of the 19th century by Ledi Sayadaw. 

The Forest Tradition in Thailand dates from 1900, founded by Ajaan Mun and Ajaan Sao Kanatasilo.

whatever is the limit of nirvana,
that is the limit of samsara—

There's no such thing as the "apex of yanas". This line of thinking does nothing but boost the ego which is why we often see Vajrayanists(not all) belittle other practices and think it is perfectly fine when they are just creating more bad karma for themselves.[/quote]

Of course there is an apex of yānas. For example, Śantideve points out that the ultimate of the lower is the relative of the higher in reference to tenet systems. Thus the view of Vaibhāṣika is lower than that of Sautrantika; the view of Sautrantika is lower than that of Yogacara, the view of Yogacara is lower than that of Madhyamaka and so on. 

While indeed it is incorrect to needlessly belittle anyone's path, whether Buddhist or nonBuddhist, it is much worse karma to abandon a higher path for a lower path.

It is entirely true. 

Rinpoche includes these things because they need to be understood, not because this is how one is to practice. He states in the same book:

However, those who follow Dzogchen teachings on the basis of clear understanding of the fundamental characteristics of the kinds of conduct in the diverse paths should apply themselves until they are able to unify or integrate their essential points in the dimension of the behavior of Samantabhadra of Ati.

And, having been his student for the past 25 years, I really do know his point of view concerning vows. If someone finds being a bhikşu helpful in their practice, then he is all for it. But it is not necessary. It is not even necessary for Dzogchen practitioners to take the five precepts or engage in a refuge ceremony. From his point of view, one begins with direct introduction first, not first taking pratimoksha vows, then bodhisattva vows, then vajrayāna vows and so on.

I explained this to you a long time ago when there was some discussion of what it means to take an empowerment. 

In short, the guru generates himself as the mandala of the deity, and then generates the mandala of the deity in front of himself. The latter mandala is the one from which one takes the empowerment. The teacher guides one to the doors of the mandala, and one requests admission. Then, one is allowed inside the mandala and shown all of the details of the mandala. This happens before the vase, secret, prajña's pristine consciousness and word empowerments happen. When the empowerment is over, the guru dissolves both mandalas. (This is why it is impossible to receive empowerments from recordings).

It is really not the same. How things really are is not a "fact." Facts require empirical agreement. There is no way that "how things really are" can be subject to such empirical agreement. Why? Because how things really are is a personal intuition (in the philosophical sense) and cannot be communicated verbally to others. It is something that must be know for oneself. Thus the Buddha declared, "Ehipaśyika," "Come and see!"

Papayin Māra is a Paranirmitavaśavartino deva, according to the Āryalaṅkāvatāra-nāma-mahāyānasūtravṛttitathāgatahṛdayālaṃkāra. 

This is the character which appears in Sūtra. Māra in general refers to various kinds of obstacles on path, death, afflictions, pride, and the aggregates. These were the four māras that were conquered by the Buddha. 

Papayin Māra though is a sort of divine fool, who constantly tries to make trouble for the Buddha but always fails miserably.

It has both epistemic and ontological ramifications. Its epistemic ramification is that belief in a self is a false belief since there is no entity which can be taken as a self. Its ontological ramification is that questions of being and nonbeing are strictly conventional. 

That being said, Buddhadharma certainly has a metaphysics, such doctrines as karma, rebirth, and so on are metaphysical in nature. Abdhidharma deals with many metaphysical issues, such as the nature of time, the nature of causality, and so on. The literature of the Prajñāpāramita deals with the metaphysics of the bodhisattva path and so on.

Specific conditions must be met for the manifestation of a supreme nirmanakāya. This is the subject of an elaborate buddhology in Dzogchen teachings.

No, there are serious flaws in the gdzhan stong presentation of the three natures which contradict the way they are explained by Maitreyanatha, Asanga, and Vasubandhu. You should read Karl Brunnhölzl. He is perhaps on the world's leading expert on gzhan stong and is Indian antecedents. 

We can argue the relative merits of this sūtrayāna point of view or that one, but they are all the same in so far as they are intellectual analysis and in the end do not actually lead anywhere except to endless proliferation. At a certain point, they must be dropped and abandoned so that one can enter the experiential view gained in the fourth empowerment/direct introduction/pointing out.

I think what is confusing is your use of the term "retroactive."

Buddhas do not live in time. They do no perceive time. Time is a relative cognition. Buddhas have no relative cognitions. Nevertheless, conventionally, buddhas arise in time, and at one time there was a moment when every buddha was not a buddha, including Buddha Samantabhadra, the so called "adi-buddha." This is why in Dzogchen teachings we talk generically about a time when buddhahood has not been realized and there were no deluded sentient beings.

Some Dzogchenpas may, but it is nowhere near universal. Longchenpa states quite clearly that the view of Dzogchen and the view of Prasanga Madhyamaka are compatible.

For example, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu has, several times over the years, explained why gzhan stong view is incompatible with Dzogchen. It mainly has to do with the gzhan stong assertion that qualities are already fully formed within sentient beings, not as mere potentials which can manifest.

The point is that you keep on presenting the path in your tradition as if it is somehow universal and more valid. For example, in Sakya, they do not use the terminology at all. For Sakyapas, as indeed for Nyingma and Kagyu as well,with respect to the "nature body" aka svabhākaya, in Vajrayāna practice is simply the fact that the three kāyas are an inseparable unity, while in the sūtra presentation it is generally understood to be synonym of the dharmakāya. Your presentation is an adaptation of Haribhadra's interpretation of the svabhāvakakāya to Vajrayāna, but I am not really certain it is appropriate to mix up sūtra and tantra in this way.

Second, Trump lost the election not just by 2.8 million votes that went to Clinton. He also lost the 6 million votes that went for Johnson and Stein. 

This means that while he won the electoral college, (by barely 300,000 votes) he very badly lost the popular vote.

It is not something that can be proven. For example, there is the famous Tara Tantra. It exists in the bka' 'gyur, yet it, along with a number of other "gsar ma" tantras of the Kriya Tantra are not accepted by Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo. 

One cannot prove any text to be spoken by the Buddha. This is why, when challenged over the doctrine of the bardo, Vasubandhu simply states, "merely because you do not read it does not mean it is invalid." This is his response to the charge that this or that text is not Buddhavacana. 

This is why my response to you is that merely because you do not read this or that text, does not invalidate it. Moreover, just as Nāgārjuna warned Hinayanists who criticized Mahāyāna it was better oif they merely put it aside without criticizing it, likewise too, you would be better off putting Dzogchen aside without criticizing it. 

As for obscurations, they are not real, substantial things that need to removed, like a stain from clothes. As the famous Haribhadra points out, when one achieves buddhahood, one understands one was never deluded all along. As Maitreyanath states, "Nothing here to add, nothing here to remove."

"If sentient beings are buddhas by nature, just what is the difference between buddhas and sentient beings?

The Hevajra Tantra states:

Sentient beings are buddhas, 
but they are temporarily obscured by taints—
when removed, they are buddhas.

This is why sentient beings do not need a prediction for buddhahood. The anuyoga tantra, Sarvatathāgata-citta-jñāna-guhyārtha-garbha-vyūha-vajra-tantra-siddhi-yogāgama-samāja-sarvavidyāsūtra-mahāyānābhisamaya-dharmaparyāya-vivyūha-nāma-sūtra, states:

natural, primordial buddhahood—

You may find it inconvenient that this is so (just as you find it inconvenient that a wonderful text on Dzogchen exists in all editions of Tsongkhapa's collected works, in the first volume), but it exists.

I just did give a scriptural source, The Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra. Then there is the Kulyarāja Tantra (D 828) (Sarvadharma-mahāśanti-bodhicittakulayarāja), which is in all bka' 'gyurs. This tantra mentions Śākyamuni Buddha in chapter thirty-four in which it is explained that Kulyarāja, the teacher of all teachers, encompasses the mind of Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, the seven buddhas including Śākyamuni, the 1002 buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa, and buddhas no matter where they are or when they are. The transcendent state of all the buddhas that has always been naturally perfected from the beginning in the dimension of the unconditioned, all-pervading dharmadhātu is equal with space. In other words, the three kāyas of all the victors are contained within the mind of perfect realization (byang chub sems, bodhicitta) which generates everything. 

There is also the Sarvatathāgata-citta-jñāna-guhyārtha-garbha-vyūha-vajra-tantra-siddhi-yogāgama-samāja-sarvavidyāsūtra-mahāyānābhisamaya-dharmaparyāya-vivyūha-nāma-sūtra, Sarvatathāgatacittaguhyajñānārthagarbha-krodhavajrakula-tantra-piṇḍārthavidyāyogasiddhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, Śrī-guhya-garbha-tattva-viniścaya,Devījāli-mahāmāyā-tantra-nāma and the Śrī-heruka-karuṇākrīḍita-tantra-guhya-gaṃbhīra-uttama-nāma. 

All of these tantras, which all exist in the bka' 'gyur, all teach Dzogchen. 

Then there is the Bodhicittamahāsukhāmnāya composed by Atisha, D 1696, which is text explaining the view and meditation of Dzogchen, which supports the view of the Nyinthig tradition that Atisha attained his realization through practicing the Great Perfection.

The Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra, which is the first Dharma to be taught by the first Buddha of this eon, lists Śākyamuni Buddha among the 12 teachers of Dzogchen. The other Buddha we know about from others sources which is included in this list is Buddha Kaśyāpa.

We all recognize this world system is dominated by the supreme nirmanakāya Śākyamuni, in this particular time in the Bhadrakalpa. But times change and to take this into account Sākyamuni Buddha either directly taught different teachings for different time periods, or predicted the teachers who would. We now live in the period of the five degenerations, and so the path of renunciation teachings are not longer very effective because the afflictions of sentient beings are too strong.

No, Mahāayāna doxology in general maintains that Śākyāmuni is a nirmanakāya, a manifestation of the sambhogakāya Vairocana. It is accepted in all Mahāyāna schools that Śākyamuni Buddha's 12 deeds were merely a display, a mere show to inspire sentient beings. Indeed, that his entire career explained in the Jataka tales, offering his body to the starving tigress, residing in Tuṣita Heaven as the deva Svetaketu, and even his very first moment of bodhicitta in hell was merely a dramatic display for sentient beings. 

The one Indian commentary we have on the Lotus Sūtra suggests that references in the sūtra to the nirmanakāya's longevity and so on are to be understood as attributes of the sambhogakāya and dharmakāya. There are five certainties with respect to sambhogakāya: place, teacher, retinue, teaching, and time. The place is Akaniṣṭha Gandavyuha (only accessible to bodhisattvas on the pure stages). The teacher is always Vairocana. The teaching is always Mahāyāna. The retinue is always bodhisattvas on the pure stages. The time is always. The nirmanakāyas on the other hand does not possess these five certainties. However, in order to generate faith, the 15th chapter of the Lotus deliberately ascribes qualities, a lifespan, and the five certainties to the nirmanakāya normally reserved for the dharmakāya and sambhogakāya. 

It is also important to understand the dharmakāya of the buddhas of the three times is single. It is the same realization. It is never a different realization. The buddhas have one transcendent state. It does not matter if you call a buddha Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vajrayogini, Mañjuśrī, Vairocana, Vipassi, Śākyamuni, etc. They all have the same mind. The dharmakāya is single. Therefore, there is only one Teacher, no matter how many manifestations of that teacher appear. This is the actual profound point the Lotus Sūtra is making with respect to the person of the Buddha. There is a manifestation of the Teacher's nirmanakāya beyond all limitations for each and every sentient being. 

When this chapter is read with reference to the wider context of general Mahāyāna doxography, it becomes quite clear what the intent is. The intent is to make people understand that the three kāyas are inseparable. Wherever there is a nirmanakāya, that nirmanakāya possesses also the other two kāyas, and vice versa.

If on the other hand you begin to claim as some do that only Śākyamuni is the real buddha, etc., then you slip into the deviation of condemning the Dharma and slandering the Buddha.

Nāgārjuna? Vasubandhu? Asanga? I can give you a list of Indian Panditas as long as your arm. 

The contemporary Sanskrit edition is indeed later than the recension the Tibetan translation is based upon. But there are no serious differences between the recension the Tibetan translation is based upon and the recension that Kumarajiva used. It goes without saying that the Tibetan translation is more accurate than the Chinese translation, of any period. 

[/quote] Well I don't even necessarily believe that either, but it is a valid reading of what the text literally says, and for many Buddhists, nothing around the Chapter 15-17 mark of the Lotus Sutra is at all provisional.[/quote]

The point of chapter fifteen is to explain why, among other things, the Buddha manifested nirvana when in fact he had no need to:


If it is asked why  show nirvana without going to nirvana, 
if I was always to be seen,
the ignorant who do not understand would become lazy. 


And as for the lifespan issue, Pṛthivībandhu explains:

The lifespan with which nirmanakāya of the Tathāgata is endowed is an expedient explanation so that sentient being will generate devotion to [the Tathāgata] because the qualities and lifespan of the dharmakāya and sambhogakāya is incalculable

Primodial Buddhahood of this kind is rejected as irrational by Indian masters. Any assertion that there can be a primordial Buddha in the sense you mention above is "heretical," outside the pale of Dharma. 

It is well understood that Śākyamuni is a nirmanakāya, i.e., an emanation of the sambhogakāya Vairocana, who in turn is the emanation of the dharmakāya, sometimes referred to in Yoga tantra and so as as Samantabhadra. This means that the Buddha's 12 acts were merely a play. But it does not mean that there wasn't a continuum at some point that realized the nature of reality and attained the dharmakāya level of realization, manifesting in myriad ways to benefit sentient beings according to the latter's inclinations. 

However, just as there is no beginning of samsara, there was never a time when there were no buddhas guiding sentient beings. 

But when we speak of buddhas living outside, in the world, etc., this is a very external view. It had nothing to do with how the three kāyas relate to ourselves and our own nature. The latter is far more important than provisional buddhological  cosmologies.

However, my confidence in Dzogchen teachings is not based on a belief because I have confirmed them for myself experientially. This allows me to reasonably infer other Buddhist beliefs I have may be true, but they remain unconfirmed beliefs. So, one should be very diligent in distinguishing that which one knows as opposed to that which one simply believes.

Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, Vairocana, cittavajra, tathāgatagarbha, prajñāpāramitā, mind-essence, ordinary mind, luminosity, emptiness, pristine consciousness, bodhicitta, etc., are all just synonyms for the same thing: one's own unfabricated mind. As Ju Mipham states:

That luminosity of the primordial original basis, the original reality, is the ultimate dharmatā of all phenomena. All appearances of samsara and nirvana arise from that state. As soon as they arise, [3/b] it is impossible that there is a single phenomena other than abiding in that state. Since this is the ultimate ground of liberation, this is called “the dharmakāya of ultimate reality.” When the ultimate obscuration along with temporary traces are purified, the truth of cessation of the supreme vehicle is called “the svabhāvakāya that possesses the two ultimate purities.” That basis in which there is neither delusion nor liberation is the totally uniform nature.

The Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:


Everything is gathered into the essential state of Mañjuśrī, 
the pristine consciousness of all Secret Mantra,
the measure of the unerring transcendent state.
Therefore I am called the jñānasattva. 
Everything is part of the family
of Mañjuśrī no matter where it is, 
utterly pure, issuing from my state. 
I am the Bhagavan victor

But as Norbu Rinpoche said again today, belief is useless because you can believe or have faith in anything. Only direct experience is useful, because then a) you will not need to believe anything and b) you will have no doubt.

No, there is no reading between the lines in this. 

The term ādibuddha  canonically arrived with the Mañjuśrī-jñānasattvasya-paramārtha-nāma-saṃgīti, where the term adibuddha is used as a name for Mañjuśrī by Śākyamuni Buddha:

The adibuddha lacks a cause.

Garab Dorje define the phrase as follows:

"The adibuddha lacks a cause" means self-originated pristine consciousness

"Self-originated" here means something discovered within oneself, not something that was shown to one from outside. 

Mañjuśrimitra explains the line as follows:

[Mañjuśrī] is the adibuddha because his identity from the first is dharmatā. 

Vimalamitra explains the line in a more general sense, based on the passage that precedes:


If is asked how it is free from cause and condition,
since there is no beginning and end in buddhahood, 
the activity of the Buddhas of the three times,
the adibuddha lacks a cause—
the single eye of pristine consciousness is untainted.


He comments:

The activity of the buddhas of the buddhas of the three times is guiding sentient beings, but since there is no source for buddhahood in the beginning, nor a place to go in the end, it has no first cause.  Since the taints of dualistic grasping are absent in it, the eye of pristine consciousness is single.


Thus, in the text spoken by the Buddha, adibuddha refers not to a person, but rather to a principle.

The instance on the part of Nicherin Buddhists on Śākyamuni Buddha as "the adibuddha" misses the mark, in my opinion. 

There are an 32 different writing on various aspects of this text attributed to Mañjuśrimitra alone out of a total of 79. It is probably the most commented upon tantra.

I base my practice on wisdom. In other words, the Buddha said:

Follow the Dharma, not the person.
Follow the meaning, not the words.
Follow the definitive meaning, not the provisional meaning.
Follow wisdom, not mind. 

The definitive meaning is set forth by the Akṣayamatinirdeśa sūtra:

Any sūtrānta that explains a self, a sentient being, a living being, a human being, a person, a man, human, a creator, a feeler in so many words, which shows that which lacks a self to be a self, those sūtrāntas are called "the provisional meaning." 

Any sūtrānta that explains emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, nonformation, nonarising, nonproduction, nonexistence, nonself, no sentient being, no living being, no person, no lord, and shows the gates of liberation, those sūtrāntas are called "the definitive meaning."

So no, I do not actually base my Buddhist practice on any texts. But in terms of texts I like, I prefer the sūtras that meet the criteria listed in about.

No, everything else, whether more or less rapid, sūtra or tantra, ends where Dzogchen begins. That's the point. And one can begin with Dzogchen. Anyone  who is interested, that is. The reason I insist upon this is to assist people with a previous disposition for Dzogchen teachings to pursue them without fear of or thinking they need to follow some gradual path. I am thinking of those people's benefit, not my own. My own benefit is quite secure.

It is a fact. Just review his claims and my claims. My claims are factual, his claims are not. For example, he claims that Dzogchen is not part of Tsongkhapa's oeuvre. This is false. It is. 

He claims that Dzogchen is not a valid Buddhist teaching. Again, this is false, since there are at least two major tantras in the bka'  'gyur that are either Dzogchen tantras or mention Dzogchen. In addition we have many texts by Padmasambhava and so which refute this claim. 


He claims that Dzogchen is not the teaching of Śākyamuni. Again false. Śākyamuni is one of the 12 Buddhas who taught Dzogchen either directly or indirectly. 

It is also a fact that Dzogchen is highest teaching of the Buddha there is. Just read the Kulayarāja tantra. 

TKF has promulgated a cascade of false assertions about Dzogchen, many of them for some years. He has never been challenged on the facts of these claims by anyone administering this board.

You missed the point. The principle is the same, the ultimate of the lower is the relative of the higher.

But since you don't know anything at all about Dzogchen teachings, it is very foolish for you to continually condemn it, especially since Tsongkhapa clearly accepted it. 

If you say that Dzogchen contradicts Highest Yoga Tantra, there is no fault since Madhyamaka contradicts Yogacara. Just as Yogacara is lower than Madhyamaka, likewise, Highest Yoga Tantra is lower than Dzogchen. Just as Kriya tantra is lower than carya, carya is lower than yoga, and yoga tantra is lower than annutarayoga tantra, etc, likewise, in general, highest yoga tantra belongs to what is termed in Nyingma tantras as mahāyoga. But there are two more categories of tantra higher than mahāyoga (to which Guhysamaja, etc., belong), i.e. anuyoga and atiyoga (Dzogchen). 

In general, all of the creation and completion practice of the Sarma schools is confined to mahāyoga. Anuyoga focuses mainly on completion stage practice. Atiyoga is beyond both.

Kongtrul was actually told by Khyentse to write the five treasures. It was not his idea. 

Basically, Khyentse understood that without compiling these teachings in one place, they would be lost. 

Khyentse's own personal project was preserving all the major Sarma empowerment lineages as well as the the sadhana lineages which have come down through Sakya in the rgyud sde kun 'dus and the sgrub thabs kun 'dus. 

But when we look at what Khyentse, Kongtrul and Choling were most interested in, they were most interested in Dzogchen teachings, treasures and their revelation. 

Why does this matter? Because all the Rime Lamas and lineage holders hold Dzogchen as their main practice, including HH Dalai Lama. Why? Because Dzogchen is more profound than other teachings.

You are conflating discrimination in its primary sense with discrimination in its secondary sense. Freedom from discrimination (in its primary sense) is an inalienable right. Sending boys and girls to gendered schools is not necessarily discriminatory in the primary sense— though it could be, if like my mother, as part of that education one was forced to learn how to peal peaches with white gloves on since no boys were ever expected to learn such a useless skill.

You assert that emptiness means the absence of inherent existence. If you define emptiness solely as the absence of inherent existence, you are defining emptiness as a nonexistence. The nonexistence of what? The nonexistence of inherent existence. This means you are defining ultimate emptiness as a nonexistence.

No, that is not what I am saying at all. Indeed, it completely misses the mark. 

But I will say that I don't think anyone at all is going to move from the sūtra path of preparation to the path of seeing by meditating on a lopsided emptiness. 

I am pretty certain that the reason why Gelugpas also attain high realization is because of Vajrayāna practice, but not because the view of emptiness set forth by Tsongkhapa in various places is unmistaken or perfect. 

Why do I say this? Because even Cittamatrins like Virupa attained realization of the stages without having a completely correct understanding of emptiness because of their Vajrayāna practice (specifically in his case he attained the first bhumi during empowerment).

In general, the instruction not to eat after noon really has nothing to do with discipline. It has to do with health. At midday our metabolic heat is strongest because the sun is high in the sky. When we eat in the evening, it is harder for us to digest meals. 

The Buddha was a wise person and observed that those who ate large meals in the evening suffered from digestive problems. 

If you look at the west, millions and millions of people are on Prilosec and so on. The reason is very simple. They eat the wrong combinations of food in the wrong amounts at the wrong times.

Yes, and this is why refuting only inherent existence rather that all four extremes misses the mark. 

Someone who has realized emptiness does not need a pot to boil water. 

But the idea that inherent existence is all we need to negate makes emptiness more comfortable for modern people who at base do not wish to abandon their realism. 

As long as someone thinks that the appearance of pots withstand analysis, for that long they will never even have a chance of realizing rainbow body.

Candra agrees that both nihilists and Mādhyamikas are alike in rejecting inherent existence, but they differ in that Mādhyamikas advocate dependent origination, and claim that this life and the next lack inherent existence. The second thing is that nihilists reject what they cannot see, whereas the Mādhyamika willing infers from dependent origination that there is another world after death in this one and so on.

The suffering of suffering seems real enough for those to whom it appears. For example, when I have a kidney stone, it seems pretty real in that moment, since I am just an ordinary guy. But I also have training and so I also know it is not real, it is not essential, and is principally a function of delusion and karma by which this false appearance is maintained. I also know that delusion is not solid or real, and that any tendency to give into feelings of solidity or realness reinforces that mistaken perception. So while I am writhing in agony I am also acutely aware of the fact apart from pain that has been experienced and has not been experienced, at present there is no pain —&nbsp;at least in my better moments.

Ucchedavāda, very often mistranslated as nihilism, was originally the assertion that a self which exists now perishes at death. 

It was later applied to the general idea of asserting that a thing which exists now perishes and becomes nonexistent. 

In common perception, if something exists, it can be destroyed. For example, a pot or a tree. When we cut down a tree, we commonly say, "There used to be a tree there, now it no longer exists."

"There used to be a coral reef there, now it no longer exists."

This is the way common people speak, and it is not accurate. 

When read carefully, one comes to understand that Nāgārjuna shows that nothing in conventional truth, that which is perceived by common people, has any basis in reality whatsoever. 

Things are false entities we abstract from appearances. When examining these things we find that they do not exist apart from our definition of them. Their boundaries are arbitrarily drawn and defined. 

The point of Madhyamaka is not to claim there are no appearances. The point of Madhyamaka is to understand these appearances are not real. For example, a liquid entity appears in six different ways to the beings of the six different realms, an appearance conventionally valid for one is invalid for the rest. Water is real for a human but not a hell being. We cannot therefor say that appearances are real. 

What cloudburst means when he says things "merely exist" is that these appearances function within our scope of perception. 

But the point of Madhyamaka is to find the real nature of these appearances, whatever it is, because these appearances are not real entities.  The point is Madhyamaka is not make a perfect relative truth for human beings, because no relative truth is perfect. They are all flawed perceptions. The objects of flawed perceptions are deceptive. The way they appear and the way they exist are not integrated. For a Buddha, the way things exist and the way things appear are integrated. Madhyamaka is trying to uncover the meeting point between the way things exist and the way things appear. Since conventional truth is not the way things exist but merely the way things appear to ordinary people, we say that conventional truth is unreal since it does not conform with how things exist. The Gelugpas would have one believe that merely by understand that the things that appear are devoid of inherent existence is itself the reconciliation point between the way things exist and the way the appear. They assert that the way things exist is free of inherent existence, and that solely by negating inherent existence one comes to harmony between the way things exist and the way they appear. 

I personally have found yet no convincing argument that the negation of inherent existence is all there is to Mahāyāna emptiness. In this I follow a 600 year old tradition of objection to the Gelugpa point of view.

I also think Madhyamaka is a very limited tool.

Clearly, that is not a Buddhist account, and I'm not presenting it as such. But it is much closer to the style of Buddhist arguments, than anything from modern analytical or empirical philosophy. It's also interesting because of the dialectical nature of the analysis, i.e. things that are real on one level, are unreal on another. I think that aspect is quite close in meaning to the original import of the two truths teaching.[/quote]

It is a little different. As Śantideva points out, the ultimate of the lower is the relative of the higher. When we come to Madhyāmika, the negation of the lower is not an affirmation of its own tenets because Madhyamaka has no tenets to proclaim.

It has to do with how abhāva is being defined in the MMK. In Madhyamaka, nonexistence is the nonexistence of something which has arisen.

They are not nonexistents from the point of ordinary people. From the point of view of ordinary people, things which arise in dependence exist. When one discusses with ordinary people how things are, the only acceptable way to talk about the things which they believe to exist is from the point of view of dependent origination, where this exists that exists, and so on. But this manner of speaking about phenomena is not definitive nor is it final. But if you prefer that I treat you as an ordinary person who has no training in tenets systems, etc., then for you I will say that this and that exists. 

From the point of view of some like ourselves who have examined phenomena, it is not correct to state that dependent phenomena exist since they have never arisen, just as illusory elephants and so on have never arisen and yet appear. It is also not correct to state they do not exist since it is improper to say of something which has never arisen that it does not exist. 

So we craft this term, "clearly apparent nonexistent." It is a standard term in Sakya and Nyingma Madhyamaka. You may not like it but we don't care.

We prefer to say that what appears and functions are "clearly apparent nonexistents" since they cannot be found on analysis.
