Yes, because the conceptual view one learns is provisional unless or until one realizes suchness for oneself. Of course, for most people, their success in realization is indicated by the amount of hearing, reflection, and cultivation they do. Thus, people with little hearing have a much longer time on the path.

It is an issue of transformation, in this case, their position has an inner contradiction. They are trying to account about mind can produce both samsara and nirvana. So the idea is that when the traces of affliction are emptied out of the ālaya, this causes the ālaya to effectively cease to exist, and the remaining mental skandhas transform into the four wisdoms which are now unconditioned. This is explained pretty well in teh Mahāyāna Samgraha.

No, this is not correct. The absence of the imputed nature in the dependent nature is the perfected nature. 

The two truths are reconciled in Yogacara through the dependent nature. 

In other words, the dependent nature is the hinge for the relative and the ultimate, samsara and nirvana, etc.

The main difference between standard Madhyamaka, where one perceives that a given entity has two natures, and the Yogācāra three natures, is that first, all given entities are reduced to mind-only, that recognition of mind-only is the transition point to recognizing that they exist only as seeds in the ālayavijñāna (the dependent nature); through recognizing that they do not existas  anything other seeds, one is no longer confused about the imagined nature (relative truth), recognizing that the dependent is empty of the imagined itself is ultimate truth. The main  problem with Yogācāra is that they are unable to account for how a conditioned consciousness transforms into unconditioned jñāna, hence Yogācāra is held by Madhyamaka to be a realist school.

The point of the analysis is not to find nothing, the point is to find something. When one's analysis fails to find something, one discovers the absence of inherent (a.k.a ultimate) existence, otherwise known as the absence of existence with respect to any of the four extremes. This analysis is not endless, since one only needs to discover the emptiness of one thing to realize the emptiness of all things. To echo Āryadeva, those who propose any sort of existence must prove the existence of each and everything they propose as existent, whereas those who make arguments via emptiness need only to prove the emptiness of one thing in order to prove the emptiness of all things.

It came from a dream of a ganapuja he had when he was around 10 years old. Since his uncle was in the dream, he asked his uncle if he knew this melody, but Heka Lingpa said he did not know that melody, and told ChNN to go to his other uncle, since SOV was part of Adzom Drukpa's practice; however, there, his other uncle taught him a melody that was used in Adzom Gar, but it was nothing like what ChNN heard in his dream at that Ganapuja. Later, when he started having dreams of the dance, the melody was slowed down considerably. I have heard recordings from the '70s where SOV was accompanied by harmonium and it was sung very rapidly compared even with the quick form of singing today.

Buddhanature is not some unity that all beings share. That would be a self-view. Buddhanature is the individual potential of each sentient being to awaken. 

Tārā is a being separate from Śākyamuni, Avalokiteśvara and so on, who all make their own aspirations, have their own namthars, etc. 

Each deity manifests from separate aspirations to provide methods for different sentient beings. Tārā the bodhisattva and Tārā, the deity in the sadhana that one manifests are not the same, but by doing the latter one invokes the aspirations of the former. However, if one realizes Tārā, there is basically no difference at that point between oneself and Tārā because the pristine consciousness of all the buddhas is identical in terms of object of realization and so on.

If you think a lobster has been killed because you order lobster, then it applies. If you are eating a steak however, there is no way that animal could be reasonably inferred to have been killed on your specific behalf.

When a beef cow is slaughtered in Denver, it is impossible for that butcher to know who will consume it unless you ordered it from the butcher himself. Likewise, if an ancient villager bought some meat that had been slaughtered the day before, when offered to a monk or nun, they can accept it. 

This is a completely different issue from whether or not there should be abattoirs at all. 

However, as long as we live in societies dominated by non-buddhists there will always be meat readily available. Thus, eating meat or not is a personal choice entirely unrelated to karma as long as one does not order, see, or know that animal was killed specifically for oneself, as in ordering a lobster and unlike ordering a streak.

The difference is that what pervades phenomena is not buddhas. Emptiness is that which pervades phenomena, in other words, all phenomena are empty. 

When we say pervades, we mean that all phenomena are similarly empty, just as all fires are similarly hot. It is not that there is one emptiness without a second that pervades all phenomena. And even emptiness is just a convention.

A Buddha is not omnipresent, they are unobstructed. There is a difference, subtle, but a difference that is important.

If you make this argument, let's say you buy a tomato from a grocer.  And that grocer also sells meat, milk, cheese, etc., all products that require killing (cows have to be impregnated and with calves to make milk). If you take seriously this reasoning you have presented, you have to accept that spending any money at a grocers is "support."

I suggest that there are two issues, which are unrelated to one another. One concerns the ethics of animal husbandry over humanitarian and environmental issues. This is a valid discussion on its own merits. It is demonstrable that industrial agriculture is toxic and bad for the environment in general. It is demonstrable that the conditions of the animals in Concentrated Animal Feed Operations (CAFO) are dreadful. 

The second, and the one that concerns us here, is to what extent we bear a karmic burden if we eat meat or participate in an economy in which this practice of eating meat is present. And what, if any impact meat eating has on our path. The latter issue is resolved via an examination of three vows. Analyzed this way, meat is permissible for śrāvakas, forbidden for Mahāyanīs, and permissible for those who practice Niruttarayogatantra (but not practitioner of the three lower tantras).

In the 12th century, Nyangral Nyima Ozer states that after Chegom (early 12th century) the teaching of the 17 tantras were very wide spread in Tibet. There is simply no evidence that Dzogchen ever waned in popularity or was actually kept in the strictest of secrecy. 

Finally, because Dzogchen was seen as controversial in the dominant monastic colleges of the day, it mainly spread outside monasteries among the laity, and the vast majority of Dzogchen literature, then as now, was committed to writing by lay tertons.

You mean is there one book that demonstrates this? No, but it is obvious when one reads through Tibetan history that Dzogchen was a very poorly kept secret for something so reserved, esoteric, and only for the elect. Dzogchen masters like Rigzin Godem had thousands of students, same with many popular tertons like Jatson Nying, Dudul Dorje, Jigme Lingpa, etc. For something so secret, it is amazing there is more literature on Dzogchen in Tibetan literature than any other tantric genre. I mean, if Dzogchen is so secret, how is it possible that 100,000 monks at Kathog attained rainbow body, as the story goes? Kathog was the earliest Nyimgma monastery, founded in the 12th century by Deshek Dampa, Phamgo Drukpa's younger brother.  

That equals 100 monks a year for the past thousand years attaining rainbow body, 8.3 per month—&nbsp;one rainbow body every 3.6 days for the past thousand years!

Not &lt;E or N&gt; is also rejected as it is the fourth extreme. 

You are confusing the Madhyamaka analysis of causal series, neither the same nor different, with the four extreme. This is the basis of most of your errors. 

The reasoning why "not existent and not nonexistent" is rejected is because there are some who proposed that existents, while arising, have a phase where they are not existent and not nonexistent.

Madhyamaka arguments are not formal proofs in logic. They are rebuttals of other's positions. 

Take the opening statement of MMK:

At no time, no where,
does any thing arise from (1) itself,
(2) from other than itself,
(3) from both, or (4) without a cause.

The first extreme is existence, arising from self; the second extreme is nonexistence, arising from other; the third extreme is both, arising from self and other; the final extreme is without cause, neither existence nor nonexistence. 

All four extremes must be refuted. There is no short cut around this.

Content:
The initial draft of the Rangdrol took about three months, finished in Dec 2011, and subsequently, five drafts. 

The initial draft of the Rangshar took about 6-7 months, that was completed in October 2012. It subsequently went through six drafts.

Then, after a hiatus where we worked on Buddhahood (originally translated over three months in the fall of 2012) to tighten up our lexicon, we returned to editing the Rangshar and Rangdrol which we envisioned publishing together.   

After Wisdom agreed to publish this work, frankly due to the success of Buddhahood, I spent six months researching and writing essays to support the text, only 25 percent of which actually made it into these two volumes. In addition, the work altogether went through five rounds of editing with one of Wisdom's senior editors, Laura Cunningham. Wisdom had an expert in Sanskrit, Rory Lindsey, review all of the Sanskrit terms in the text for proper diacritics and accuracy, and it was proofread by Emily Bower, who used to be an editor at Shambhala but now works freelance. Right now it is being indexed, and all final changes will be implemented in April. So, from start to finish, this project will have taken eight years. Amazing. When I began to translate these two texts, I had no idea it would wind up this way. 

We commissioned Tashi Mannox to do calligraphy for the two volumes. We also commissioned an original line image for Bhagavan Pawo Zhonnu Tobden, the teacher of both tantras, drawn according to how he is depicted in the Vima Nyinthig's Great Chronicle by a thangka painter, Urgyen Gyalpo, who lives and works in Toronto.  The cover design was done by Gopa Campbell. The interior book design also is based on Gopa Campbell's original interior design for Buddhahood, but was executed by Wisdom's inhouse designer, Lyndsay D'Andrea. 

Tulku Dakpa RInpoche and Jean Luc Achard (a leading western authority on Dzogchen) kindly wrote forwards for the book. In addition, Sangye Khandro has expressed amazing kindness in giving her support to our efforts, and there are a couple of other translators who have kindly agreed to lend their support, but until they actually send us their blurbs, they should remain anonymous for now. Credit is also due to the original sponsors of the Rangdrol. 

It is really amazing how many hands touched this book to bring it to completion. It has my name on it, but in reality it was a huge team effort. We owe a great debt to Daniel Aitken for his vision in seeing the possibility of bringing our work to the reading public. 

At present Team Zangthal is working on volumes three, four, and five of the series. Volume three has been submitted, the Without Syllables and its commentary. We are editing drafts of volume four, the Blazing Lamp and its commentary, and I have begun work on volume five, the Six Dimensions and its commentary. (And all of this does not count all the other translation work I have been involved with over the past 7 years.)  

Arnoud, your offer is very generous, thank you.

The exceptional features of each of the seventeen tantras of Ati Yoga’s quintessential secret cycle of the upadeśa class are described with metaphors. The Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra is described with the metaphor of the ocean. The eighty-six chapters of this oceanic treatise detail the pinnacle view, meditation, conduct, and result of all paths of Buddhadharma presented in this world. As the destined Dharma of this time, this translation is extremely timely. I wish to express deep gratitude to Malcolm and the wonderful Zangthal team for their noble aspiration and qualified capacity to finally bring these most precious teachings that exist in our world into the English language."

I answered this in many ways, but the most expressive is that there simply is no reality beneath things. There is nothing to find. Not even something free from two extremes. Therefore, ultimate truth, emptiness, is a conventional truth, because it is effective at bringing about liberation. 

Your attempt to reduce it to a formal proposition via western logic is a fools errand. Richardson already attempted this, and when he reduced Madhyamaka to statements in formal logic, he found they were incoherent. But he also missed the point of Madhyamaka, and the two truths.

I understand what you wrote, as above, I think you are suffering from lack of understanding the what the two truths actually are, which causes you to adopt a transcendentalist/realist position with respect to the two truths. For you, the ultimate is something free from the two extremes. For me, ultimate truth is merely the perception of the absence of inherent existence/four extremes in entities which arise from conditions. Among the emptinesses Candra lists, for example, is the emptiness of the ultimate:

Because it is the supreme necessity, 
the ultimate is nirvana, 
Whatever is the emptiness of that
is the emptiness of the ultimate.

The knower of the ultimate
taught the emptiness of the ultimate 
in order to avert the grasping 
of the thought that nirvana is real.

And:

Whatever is not an extreme
is described as transcending extremes;
since that is empty of itself, 
it is conventionally the emptiness of the transcended extremes. 


Now, the question for you is, is ultimate empty? Of what is it empty? If the ultimate is also empty, how can be it any thing other than a conventional truth? 

And since you are fond of citing the two extremes, if freedom from extremes is empty, how can it be anything other than a conventional truth?

Since everything from matter to omniscience is empty, how can they be anything other than conventional truths? A true ultimate truth would not be empty, now would it? 

Nāgārjuna said:

If there is something subtle tha is not empty, there is something subtle to be empty;
but as there is nothing that is not empty, where is there something to be empty?

When one does not understand the basic definitions of the system one is examining, it is difficult, as your arguments show, to build a logically coherent structure. This is why I have tried to remedy your lack of understanding of the basics of the two truths. 

You think the ultimate is something independent which can be uncovered. It isn't. The only thing that is an ultimate truth in Buddhadharma is emptiness, and that ultimate truth is also merely a conventional truth.

"Chariot" is a conventional truth, meaning when we hitch it up to horses, etc., we can go places. We know what a chariot is. No one has doubts about what a chariot is. 

But where the chariot is, this another issue altogether. Things are designated on a collection of parts. But a given thing cannot be found in any of the parts, all the parts together, or separate from the parts. So where is that given thing? The thing is found in our imputation and no where else. This is why the question of identity is what is this given thing, but where is this given thing. The purpose of this analysis, naturally, is to show that the self is merely an imputation on a collection of aggregates and that is all. 

Sherab's analysis merely indicates that ultimate truth is cognition, not that it is an independent reality. In Abhidharma, Vasubandhu says the perception of water is relative truth, the perception of its wetness, coolness, and limpidity is ultimate truth. 

Finally, if the ultimate truth of emptiness is not a conventional truth, it will not be effective in bringing about elimination of clinging, etc. Therefore, we say that ultimate truth is part of conventional truth.

The sense consciousnesses and the mental consciousness are the one and same, that is, the "eye-consciousness" is merely consciousness operating though the eye organ, taking form as an object; likewise, the mental consciousness operates through the mental organ, taking the dharma-āyatana/dhatu as its object. All consciousness are included in the vijn̄āna-skandha. There is therefore no distinction between a "fundamental consciousness" on the one hand, and secondary sensory consciousnesses on the other hand. We don't in fact have six consciousnesses, we have only one, given different names when it performs different operations. Likewise, all the vāyus in our body are actually the prāṇa vāyu, but it is given different names depending on whether is assists speech, movement, digestion, circulation, or sense perception.

Thus, when you see trekchö described as śamatha plus the view, you really need to understand here that view does not refer to the mundane discerning wisdom born of analysis. 

Thus, there is a very great difference between trekchö and sūtrayāna. However, the reason it is said that all Mahāyāna schools practice something similar to trekchö is that in the Prajñapāramita, it is said, "There is no mind in the mind, but the mind's original nature (prakrti) is luminous." The Gelugpas term this unfabricated mind "the mind of clear light" in English translation.

There are two Buddhist models of perception: Model A is externally triadic, that is, a percept arises based on the contact of a sense organ with an external sense object. Model B is internally triadic, holds that percepts are the actually the activation of traces that provide the content of the world that we perceive as external. 

Madhyamaka is happy with either model. Both are relative, not ultimate.

In (ultimate) reality there is no meditator nor a dharmadhātu. All such distinctions are conventional. I don't negate these things conventionally speaking, but ultimately they cannot be established at all. 

With respect to this issue, I follow the position of the Jetsun Sakya Gongma who declare, "there is no reality (gnas lugs med pa)" and always have. In other words, since the four extremes cannot be established for relative phenomena, there is no way the four extremes can exist in the ultimate either. This being so, there is no reality as there isn't anything established which can be free from the four extremes. The ultimate is considered inexpressible not because it is something free from the four extremes, it is inexpressible because nothing can established by way of the four extremes either relatively or ultimately. 

As the Samputa Tantra puts it:

Nothing empty, nothing not empty, and nothing to perceive in the middle.

Another citation (and this is as far away from Hua Yen as one can get), because it is useful— Mipham, commenting on Mañjuśrīmitra's Meditation of Bodhicitta states:


Since neither the state of affliction nor of purification [10/a] is established, because awakening (buddhahood) and non-awakening (sentient beinghood) are the same in terms of being equally without characteristics, there is no buddhahood to accept or sentient beinghood to reject.

Also, if the ultimate is not established, where will one see words that state “It is like this?” If there is an analysis in accordance with the meaning of how it is explained, all of those explanations for the so called “nominal ultimate”, “absence of arising and ceasing”, “sameness”, “nonduality”, “beyond thought”, “emptiness”, “the dharmadhātu”, and so on are didactic conventions. In the true definitive meaning, they are neither ultimate nor are they relative. If there is the perception, “The path is like this in accordance with the ultimate (which  is not a convention),” then that is relative, but not ultimate. In reality, where is there a “relative and ultimate” that are inseparable as the two truths? 

Mañjuśrīmitra's very next passage states:


Do not abandon or dwell in any Dharma at all, with or without doubt. 
Since the meditator and the dharmadhātu do not exist, there is nothing to doubt and there is nothing to perceive as ultimate. 

MIpham expands on this:

Since the Dharma of those with doubt who have not seen the true meaning and those without doubt who have seen it in realty is neither true nor false at all, do not abandon the false nor dwell in the true. If it is asked why, in reality, because the meditator and the dharmadhātu do not exist, who has doubts about something? [10/b] Therefore, there is also nothing to perceive as ultimate in the Dharma that is without doubt because in scripture it is said that it is necessary for one to abandon craving to conducive Dharma and aversion to unconducive Dharma.

The question is framed incorrectly. Treckhöd is best described in general terms as a practice in which insight into emptiness and śamatha are combined. But below the path of seeing, this insight is conceptual, based on the example wisdom of the direct introduction. However, the emptiness meditated upon in trekchöd is also inferential until one mounts the path of seeing. There really is no difference between perfection of wisdom, mahāmudra, Chan/Zen, etc., and tregchöd. I have heard it said that Tulku Orgyen asserted that trekchöd exists in all yānas, perhaps EPK would be kind enough to confirm this. What separates from trekchöd from these other systems of the method of introduction. Trekchöd, like any secret mantra practice, is based on empowerment/introduction.

Correct, we are conveying meaning with words. This is why Bhavaviveka distinguishes two kinds of ultimate, enumerated or nominal, which is conventional, and an unenumerated ultimate which is not within the range of convention since it cannot be experienced by worldlings, but only by āryas. 

A true relative truth is the apprehension of a functional object that is mistaken about the object's nature (self of phenomena). Such a relative truth is called conventional to indicate its functionality. Thus, when we describe emptiness, ultimate truth, this description, while ultimately true, is nevertheless part of conventional truth. When we cognize emptiness as an object below the path of seeing, it is only nominally an ultimate, thus, it is still conventional because it is not a direct perception of emptiness, but only an approximation.

I don't think I agree. For example, when one, a beginner, dissolves appearances into emptiness, is that emptiness conceptual or nonconceptual? When at the end of a sadhana one dissolves the deity into emptiness, is that emptiness conceptual or nonconceptual? If one is below the path of seeing, it is conceptual by necessity. The difference is that emptiness is based on the example wisdom of the empowerment rather than analysis.

According the Gelug school, Buddhas can think thoughts, recognize objects, and so on. It is the position of the Sakya school that Buddhas are utterly free from thought at all times. 

What the Sakyapas object to most about Gelug view is the statement that clinging to an intellectual representation of emptiness is acceptable and even necessary.

All Tibetan schools holds that a correct, inferential understanding of emptiness is necessary. Where they disagree is mostly on pedagogy. For example, the Gelugpas claim that even if one is practicing Vajrayāna, one must nevertheless still engage in analytical meditation based on identifying the proper object of negation according to Madhyamaka reasons. 

Sakya, on the other hand, maintains that the example wisdom demonstrated during empowerment corresponds with a proper inferential understanding of emptiness, and it is on the basis of this one practices.

Anytime you see the ultimate truth expressed in words, it needs to be understood as an example ultimate. 

The term "ultimate truth" simply represents a limit of analysis, btw. This is why the ultimate truths of śrāvakas are overthrown by Madhyamaka. Madhyamaka is the only school also which uses no affirming negations but only non-affirming negations. 

The main thrust of my point however is that without intellectual comprehension of the example ultimate, the actual ultimate truth cannot be realized. Thus, we have to accept the conventional ultimate as necessary since it is functional in the production of the result, nirvana.

The term itself is mainly confined to the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, but you can see many sūtras where the term dharmatā is systematically related to dharmadhātu. For example, the Bodhisattvapitika sutra among others makes the following statement:

That dharmatā should be understood to be a place, therefore, the dharmadhātu is called "a place."

Or, The Sarvabuddha-viṣayāvatāra-jñānālokālaṃkāra-sūtra states:

Whether the tathāgatas arise or not, dharmatā, dharmasthitikatā, and this dharmadhātu are only places.

The equivalence of this trio is repeated over and over again in the order, dharmatā, dharmadhātu and dharmasthitikatā. 

There are further uses in Tantric literature but I generally exclude those here.

I think you not really understand well the content of the authorities in our discussions, preferring instead to rely on your own musings— this is why with you, I insist on bringing up the texts, because you never reason based on citations. As Āryadeva notes in the 400, since we share the same school, citations are appropriate. If we did not, I would not use citations at all. 

Now, from what I can see, you seem to think that an ultimate truth is something other than a cognition of an object. Thus we have a basic disagreement over terminology. 

1) An enumerated ultimate truth can only be a conventional truth, and this is something that all Madhyamaka masters accept. The so-called non-enumerated ultimate truth cannot be explained in words at all since it is the ārya's direct perception of emptiness.

2) When an ordinary, worldly person engages in analysis to ascertain emptiness, that enumerated ultimate truth, their perception of an inferential emptiness, is simply a convention which means, "I have reached the limit of my ability to analyze this object, and all I can come up with is that it is empty of inherent existence." That perception of emptiness, while designated an ultimate truth, is confined to conventional truth because it is the inferential perception of a mundane person. Thus, even this ultimate truth is non-veridical since it is an inference and not a direct perception. How are inferences non-veridical? for example, it is like mistaking mist for smoke and inferring there is a fire, or perceiving a mirage and inferring there is water. Even the common direct perceptions (mist, mirage) of the worldly are no insurance that their cognitions are veridical. 

3) When an ārya explains their yogic direct perception of emptiness to worldlings, this ultimate truth is still a conventional truth i) because it is expressed in words and ii) because the perception of worldlings is by definition non-veridical. Why do we call this ultimate truth a conventional truth? Because it is functional in assisting the direct perception of emptiness. Āryas use either consequences or syllogisms to induce conceptual understanding of emptiness —&nbsp;but that is still an enumerated ultimate truth and thus, by definition, is a part of conventional truth. But as already stated, it is not part of false relative truth because conventional truths are functional. When we see a car, we can drive it. When we study the path, we can traverse it  

If the enumerated ultimate truth is not a conventional truth, there is no way ordinary people can realize the non-enumerated ultimate truth, in other words, there is no way they can move from an inferential perception of emptiness on the path of application to the direct perception of emptiness on the path of seeing because ordinary people's cognitions are always deluded with respect to the true existence of things— even after they have analyzed phenomena and found them to be conventionally empty. That conventional emptiness is an ultimate truth, but as it does not have the power to still proliferation on its own, hence, it is also part of conventional truth.

You should consult the Dharmadharmatāvibhanga by Maitreyanātha for a Yogacāra take on this, based on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, which itself has a whole section on the distinction between dharmas and their dharmatā, and how they can neither be the same nor different.

Well, I think this difference is that a person never arose; there is no such thing as an atman, which is why Jñānaśribhadra compared an atman with something permanent that does not arise, hence it does not exist at all, like the son of a barren women, etc. The selflessness of phenomena on the other hand is the recognition of that karma and affliction arise from proliferation due to clinging to conventional truth, i.e. clinging to functional phenomena. The first, the absence of self in persons is coarse; realizing it eliminates the afflictive obscuration; the second, the absence of self in phenomena is more subtle, and when realized, eliminates the knowledge obscuration.

Another way of understanding it is that proliferation occurs because of not seeing the selflessness of phenomena. Bhavaviveka writes in his MMK commentary:

Whatever concepts cause karma and afflictions, since those arise from proliferation, those are called "from proliferation," that is, they arises from the proliferation of the characteristic of strong attachment to conventional truth.

If it is what can stop that proliferation, proliferation, as it is said,  "is stopped by emptiness."... it is stopped by realizing the characteristic of the selflessness of phenomena."

The five dharmas are name, sign, concept, correct knowledge, and suchness. Those are divided into the three natures: name is the imputed nature; sign and concept are the dependent nature; correct knowledge and suchness are the perfected nature.

The nature is the dharmadhātu. 

The eight consciousnesses are the six sense consciousnesses, the afflicted consciousness, and the all-basis consciousness. 

The two selflessnesses are the selflessness of persons and the selflessness of phenomena.

Title: Re: Response to Bernie
Content:
Nāgārjuna states:

Without depending on convention, the ultimate cannot be explained;
without realizing the ultimate, nirvana will not be obtained.

Candrakīriti states in the Madhyamakāvatāra:

"Because all entities can be seen correctly and falsely,
entities possess a dual nature;
the correct perception of any object is true;
the false perception is called "realtive."
Also false perception is asserted to be of two kinds,
clear sense organs and faulty sense organs."

The point here is that one must have an entity in question in order to have a correct or incorrect perception. And those entities are themselves established on the basis of worldly convention which we are not supposed to contravene. The two truths are also conventions, as Candrakīrti states in his commentary on the 70: 

Relative truth and ultimate truth are conventions used by the noble ones.


And:

Here, these are true through the power of a worldly, undistorted consciousness, and are defined as ultimate truth through the power of this absence of distortion.

And:

"Uimate truth" is expressed on the basis of worldly convention."

The reason we can say that ultimate truth is conventional is that is it is functional. If ultimate truth was not functional, its perception could not lead to liberation. 

I suspect that you are conflating "truths," which are subjective perceptions, with emptiness. All objects have an ultimate nature, emptiness, which is a truth for those who can see it and is conventionally expressed as such. Also emptiness can be an object of distorted consciousness, which is why there are warnings about not apprehending it incorrectly. 

Moreover, Candra says:

Any fabricated entity which appears as true
is that which the Muni called relative truth."

In other words, the perception that entities that arise from cause and conditions are true is what we call relative truth. The perception that they are not true because they are empty is what we call ultimate truth. 

Below the path of seeing that ultimate truth can only be a conventional truth because that perception is merely an approximation of the actual lack of inherent existence or absence of the four extremes for a given thing. Such a mundane perception of the ultimate truth of emptiness may be tinged with delusion because it is relative, but since it is functional in bringing about realization, it is conventional.

Finally, the two truths are in union because they exist as aspects of any given entity. There is no ultimate truth beyond entities that are known to the world.

Well, it is Asanga who does that, in the closing words of the Mahāyānasamgraha, where niṣyanda is used as an adjective to describe the sambhogakāya where the issue of the impermanence of the sambhogakāya and nirmanakāya are raised. So I am still not convinced it is the intent of the Lanka that one can claim that niṣyandabuddha = sambhogakāya since the person who wrote down the Lanka seems to ignore the term entirely, where as nirmāṇa used in association with the rūpakāya of the Buddha has an old history. 

Niṣyanda means "corresponding cause," rgyu mthun pa, though in the Lanka there is still come influence from an earlier Chinese translation where the term is translated as rnam smin, ripened, which is normally reserved for vipaka.  Interestingly, this term is completely absent from any of the five treatises, nor can it be found in any of the works on Abhisamayālaṃkāra. 

Thus, I think it is still fair to say that the Yogacāra school really was responsible for the elaboration of the three kāyas over the older two kāya model, and it was elaborated to explain issues the two kāya model was not equipped to deal with. Most interestingly, Maitreyanatha imposes the three kāya model on the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras, in which the terms sambhogakāya, niṣyandabuddha, etc., are completely absent. There is something there to consider.

You don't recall the context. So let me recall it for you. In a diverse forum with many different traditions, people were becoming quite confused as to what constituted a "monk." Many people were showing up on the forum claiming ordination and teacher appointments in this and that school and we felt an obligation to force them to verify their ordinations/lama/teacher status to prevent misrepresentation and fraud. 

There was a great deal of public discussion of whether wine-drinking, non-celibate westerners who had received shukke tokudo were equivalent to bhikṣus or not. This naturally caused some wine-drinking, non-celibate Zen priests frequenting the forum to become upset. But these are the kind of issues that must be addressed. However, there was no "censure" of Zen monks, merely a very heated discussion of what "monk" ought to mean. Ultimately, of course, one disgruntled member threatened to sue us and put up a ridiculous anti-Esanga Website. 

I still maintain that if one is a wine-drinking non-celibate, one ought not refer to oneself as a monk. 

In other words, we had Huifeng, Khedrup, and Dhammanando on the one hand, all ordained as either śrāmaneras or bhikṣus/bhikkus who did not like the work monk being used for Soto priests, etc., and the other, we had Jundo, Nonin, and so on, noncelibates with day jobs who still wanted to be called "monks," as absurd as that sounds to me even now. 

Someone at the SZBA must have been listening, since in this document they studiously avoid referring to people with shukke tokudo or shiho as monks, referring to them solely as priests. 

You have no idea how difficult it is when you have a forum of 50k+ registered users. DW does not compare in either volume or complexity.

Bodhisattvabhumi is basically a commentary on the Sūtra-alaṃkāra, but those paths and stages are also laid in in sūtra prior to Maitreyanath, but what isn't laid out and what appears to be a novelty introduced by Maitreyanatha is the doctrine of three kāyas.

Title: Re: "One Mind" in Hua Yen thought
Content:
As long as we understand examples such as sky flowers, etc., to mean that all phenomena from matter to omniscience do not ultimately exist, then there is no problem, because they have no essence. But if we use such examples to negate phenomena which arise from cause and conditions, we run into the problem that conventional phenomena arise from causes and conditions; sky flowers and so on do not arise because they have no causes. 

The only place where use of such metaphors is acceptable is when we are making a case about the ultimate truth of a given thing. Ultimately, inherent existence and self are like sky flowers and so on because they have no cause, therefore, they do not arise, therefore they are utterly unreal, not even conventionally real. But there is a right way to realize this in accordance with suchness and ultimate truth, and a wrong way to realize this, which causes one to negate cause and condition in the relative. Thus, when we correctly observe phenomena, we see that in them there is no inherent existence and no self. The appearance of inherent existence and self is like the appearance of sky flowers, and so on, a complete delusion. 

Illusions, mirages, and so on illustrate arising from causes and conditions. Thus, this class of metaphors needs to be distinguished from the class of metaphors involving sky flowers, hair on tortoises, horns on rabbits, and so on, which illustrate phenomena which do not arise from causes and conditions, and which are thus conventionally impossible. 

The former set of metaphors indicates how conventional appearances arise in relative through cause and condition. 
The latter set of metaphors describes how the imputation of self and natures (which never have any cause or condition) onto any phenomena which arise through cause and condition is utterly mistaken, even conventionally.

To put it most simple: when we see the example of illusion, we are seeing an example of arising from cause and conditions. When we see the example of a sky flower, we are seeing an example of the negation of self and nature.

Samsara is the experience of suffering caused by karma that is motivated by affliction, that's all. When all those afflictions cease entirely due to insight, one becomes one of three kinds of buddhas: arhat, pratyekabuddhas, or samyaksambuddha, At that point, one is completely freed of birth, and that is the sole point of awakening. The innate grasping at a truly-existing self is the root of the three poisons. That innate grasping at a truly-existing self is a very subtle delusion. But it is the basic delusion that informs all of our cognitive choices and discriminations. The only thing that has meaning is the correct recognition of this deluded, innate grasping at a truly-existing self so that this delusion can be extirpated from one's continuum. We are not even projecting something on to another thing, such as imputing a self upon the aggregates. The innate grasping at a truly-existing self needs no object of imputation to be imputed. It is naturally imputed as the mere thought, 'me' or 'I.'

The difference between conventional truth and false or deceptive relative truth is that the former is strictly common perception, whereas the latter also includes hallucinations, and other deluded states which are nonfunctional.

The point of this is that without resorting to conventional truth, one cannot understand and then realize ultimate truth, and therefore, nirvana is impossible. 

The point of the illusion example is that an illusion, a deceptive relative truth, is understood to arises from causes and conditions, a veridical relative truth. And further, since this illusion arises from causes and conditions, it is natureless and lacks true existence, but its appearance is not a negandum. 

The mind that apprehends the arising of phenomena from causes and conditions cannot be a deluded mind in anyway, since this perception corresponds with suchness. Whereas, the mind that apprehends an illusion can be deluded if it misapprehends the source of the illusion as something other than causes and conditions, i.e. permanent or annihilated. 

Thus, illusion cannot be used to remove illusion since illusions are part of relative deceptive truth, rather than conventional truth.

No, the reason for this is that such appearances are a result of traces, i.e., all appearances may be mind, but that does mean that a mind is present in every instantiated appearance. Hence, even though out of ignorance the five lights are reified into the five elements, rocks nevertheless do not possess minds or rigpa. As florin points out, the five lights are just symbols for the qualities of the five pristine consciousness, but even here it is important to remember that the five pristine consciousnesses are 'relative,' as opposed to the three pristine consciousnesses of the basis (essence, nature, and compassion) which are 'ultimate.'

There is a controversy here. Tsongkhapa maintains that it is very important to identify what he terms the subtle object of negation, inherent existence, because the coarse object of negation, existence, is an over-negation. 


In other words, the cup is designated dependent on its parts. If you negate the existence of the cup, you are contradicting your own perception of the cup. If you negate only the cup's inherent existence however, you can maintain the conventional value of the cup that you perceive, but by understanding its lack of inherent existence, you can also acknowledge the cup is something which arises from conditions, since nothing that arises from conditions can be held to inherently exist—arising from conditions is simply a convention.

the immature dualistically perceive

Not knowing the mind and perceptual objects,
dualistic concepts arise. 
When the mind and objects are thoroughly known,
concepts cannot arise.

The mind becomes a diversity,
but when characteristics and the basis of characteristics are abandoned,
also the appearance of activity does not appear,
and are likewise just designations of the immature.

Since the three realms are mere concepts,
outer objects do not exist,
but are the appearance of diverse concepts:
this is not understood by the immature.  

As such, the term "One mind" does not appear in the passage at all. The commentarial literature on states that citta here refers to the eighth consciousness, the ālyavijñāna. The ālyavijñāna however is personal, rather than transpersonal.

Title: Re: The Mahayana Is Not Diluted Theravada.
Content:
The Tien Tai school's use of the term ekayāna has come to dominate discourse around it, since ekayāna is such a central term in their system. The unfortunate consequence of this is that the way the term is used by Buddhist scholars in Buddhism's native home, India, has been somewhat eclipsed. No one in India seems ever to have thought to make the term a centerpiece of their hermeneutics based on a historiographical idea of the three turnings (or five periods), just as the three turnings themselves are virtually ignored by Indian scholars, but are important to Tibetan scholars.

From the point of view of text critical methodology, there are a couple of points to bear in mind. Taking Chinese translations of Mahāyāna Sūtras as an approximate gauge of the date of their initial composition, there are no sūtras that use the terminology of the three kāyas that can be dated prior to Maitreyanatha ((ca. 270-350 CE). Thus, trying to use the term sambhogakāya with respect to sūtras earlier than Maitreyanath is anachronistic. These sūtras describe the kāyas of the buddha solely as rūpakāya and dharmakāya. The earliest depictions of the sambhogakāya are in Maitreyanatha's texts, where "sambhogakāya" principally refers to the 32 signs and 80 marks. Moreover, there are no sūtras that I can find where the two terms, rūpakāya and sambhogakāya, can be found together. 

It seems the earliest sūtra to fully embrace the terminology of three kāyas is the proto-tantric Suvarnaprabhasa Sūtra, first translated into Chinese by Dharmakṣema between 1414-421. (The question of why Maitryeanātha found it useful or necessary to elaborate the concept of the sambhogakāya, and possible influences is an interesting question, but there is no room for it here.)

Given this, we come across an important distinction: any sūtras which use the terminology of three kāyas were composed after Maitreyanātha's dates, that is, they must have been composed after 275-350 CE.

There is no discussion of ekayāna in Indian treatises that can be found in the Tibetan canon which can be dated earlier than Maitreyanatha as well (I have no idea about what can be gleaned from the Chinese canon). Given the fact that there is no distance between what Vasubandhu reports about ekayāna and Candrakīrti, it is clear that for Indian paṇḍitas, Maitreyanatha, Asanga, and Vasubandhu pretty much set the tone for how ekayāna, as well as the rest of Indian Buddhology, was to be discussed from then on. Given that this is the case, and given that the ekayāna is pretty much described as being the identical liberation of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas in both Yogacāra and post 6th century Madhyamaka sources, it is not surprising then that Tibetan scholars themselves devoted virtually no attention to the concept.

Short answer, since I lost a detailed post of sūtra citations. 

1) Buddhayāna, Ekayāna, Mahayāna and Bodhisattvayāna are absolute synonyms. 

2) The teaching of three vehicles is a skillful means. The trio Śrāvakayāna, Prayetyekabuddhayāna and Mahāyāna are more more common in sutras than the trio Śrāvakayāna, Prayetyekabuddhayāna and Buddhayāna, however, the last is always equated with Mahāyāna. 

3) The teaching of Ekayāna is in no way unique to the Saddharmakpuṇḍarīka Sūtra. In the Tibetan Canon it is mentioned 145 times, only 19 of those times is in the aforementioned sūtra.

I don't think that Nichiren was telling people to ignore Sukhavati. His axe to grind was against Honen, the founder of the Jodo-shu sect (Honen acknowledges he founded a new school of Buddhism in his seminal Senchakushū), who he believed was leading people away from the Dharma with an undue emphasis on Nembutsu, reciting the name of Amitabha Buddha, Namo Amida Butsu. 

A significant factor in his conviction about this was his belief that people in Japan had forgotten about Śākyamuni Buddha (of course they hadn't, but that is a different story), and thus he advocated for the elimination of Pure Land Buddism, which he considered a "one-sided teaching" as it was being practiced by Honen and his disciples. 

NIchiren tied some of his polemics to his belief that the practice of Pure Land Buddhism has earlier caused the suppression of Buddhism by the Taoist Emperor Wuzong (814-846) during the Tang Dynasty in China, and later on, the death in 1221 of the cloistered Japanese emperor Go-toba after he led an unsuccessful rebellion against the Kamakura Shogunate and was exiled. 

The interesting thing about this is that Go-toba actually banned Honen's Pure Land school, ordering the execution of some its adherents and the banishment of Honen. There was eventually a rapprochement, where Honen signed a pledge to reign in some of his more radical students. Despite all of this, clearly Nichiren held Honen's teaching and people response to it as being responsible for the death of Go-toba.

Since the past is not established, since it has perished, and the future is not established, since it has yet to come to be, the present cannot be established either. Therefore, dependent origination is not an eternal process because no processes can be established, other than as conventions.

Further, dependent origination is about the afflicted processes that drive samsara, affliction, action, and suffering. When affliction is removed, action has no cause; and when action has no cause, the result, suffering cannot be produced. From this perspective too, dependent origination cannot be seen as eternal, since when one attains realization, one becomes free from that process entirely.

If it is asked how a bodhisattva mahāsattva abiding on the tenth stage is called a "tathāgata," because such a bodhisattva mahāsattva has throughly completed the ten perfections, thoroughly completed the eighteen unshared buddhadharmas up to the omniscient knowledge of aspects, has totally relinquished traces, connections, and afflictions, and totally completed all buddhadharmas, Subhuti, a bodhisattva mahāsattva abiding on the tenth stage is called "tathāgata."

On the other hand, Asvabhāva writes in his Extensive Commentary on the Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras:

Since it is culmination of all vehicles, it is called Mahāyāna; since there is no other special vehicle beyond that, it is called Ekayāna. 

So from this point of view, Ekayāna is the bodhisattva path of perfections, and nothing else. 

On the Madhyamaka team, the only thing Vimuktisena writes in his massive commentary on the Abhisamayālaṃkāra:

As Haribhadra pointed out, the path, from beginning to end, is an illusion, like anything else produced from conditions, such as mirages, optical illusions, and so on. The appearances that we see have no essence when they appear, and if they are sought out, they are only found with respect to how solid our own clinging to our own sense of self is. In other words, the more real we imagine our personal self to be, the more real we imagine phenomena to be. And when we have understood that our personal self really is just a designation upon shifting conditions, which are composed of still more shifting conditions, we simultaneously can understand that about all other appearances, and sever our clinging. In the meantime, we observe conventions and do not assume these illusory conditions don't have rules and apparent consequences. But it isn't fixed or real in any meaningful, ontological, way.

Content:
Tibetan Buddhism has an extremely strong pure land component-- but it is not obvious because it is just part of the architecture of all Tibetan schools; especially Nyingma. In the Nyingma school, Amitabha is regarded as being the dharmakāya; Avalokiteśvara is the sambhogakāya; and Guru Padmasambhava is the nirmanakāya. They all have their own buddhafields; but Amitabha's is indivisible from Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyuha. Avalokiteśvara's is Mt. Potala in S. India. Guru Padmasambhava's buddhafield is on the continent of cannibals, the southwest continent of Camara (likely Madagascar).

By invoking any one of these aspects of the three kāyas, one invokes all.

Maitreya, like Śākyamuni, is presently a nirmankāya, who will succeed Śākyamuni as the fifth in line of the 1002 buddhas of this fortunate eon. It is impossible for Maitreya to possess the ignorance you attribute to him. If Maitreya, a nirmankāya, possesses such ignorance, so does Śakyamuni, a nirmankāya. So that part of your narrative, friend is inconsistent.  And save me the sermon about "The Buddha for this time and place." A nirmanak̄ya is a nirmanakāya is a nirmanakāya —&nbsp;they are either omniscient about the three times and everything in it, or they are not. Also, one can easily discover that Mañjuśrī attained full buddhahood countless eons ago, so claiming that he or any other bodhisattva belonging to the eight close sons, or even of the tenth bhumi were under the impression than Śākyamuni Buddha first attained buddhahood at Bodhgaya is totally ridiculous. It just means you ignore everything every other Mahāyāna sūtra has to say.

The problem is that conditioned entities are in spacetime. If spacetime were unconditioned, it could not contain conditioned entities because any relationship between a conditioned entity and an unconditioned entity is impossible.

With respect to Buddhist values -- they are based on "natural" law, i.e. that the ten nonvirtues contribute in general to overall misery and the ten virtues contribute to overall happiness. All Buddhist discipline takes these ten natural principles based on our body, voice, and mind as the foundation for all vows, and so on. When we add bodhicitta on top of this, we arrive at the Mahāyāna path. This is why all Mahāyāna practice, including Dzogchen, takes the motivation to attain buddhahood for all sentient beings as the basis for the path. 

Nonharming -- bodhicitta -- insight. These three are the essence of Mahāyāna ethics.

No, I would never describe mantrayāna in those terms. Mantrayāna is not sudden, it simply collapses the path of a buddha from three incalculable eons into one, seven, or 16 lifetimes depending on diligence, based on its special methods, creation and completion stage. Hence, Mantrayāna, aka uncommon Mahāyāna, is distinguished from common Mahāyāna solely by its method, but not by its view.

If this were the case it would mean the dharmadhātu had levels and grades. But as above, we can see this is false, which is why according to Candrakīrti, the liberation of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas are the same in terms of liberation.

There is no "fourth" cart. There is only one cart, Mahāyāna, the practice of the six perfections which takes three incalculable eons. The jeweled cart drawn by the white elephant (not ox) is the result of Mahāyāna practice, buddhahood. 

For example, the Lanka states:

"There are no other vehicles,
I teach only one vehicle;
but in order to guide the immature,
I explain different vehicles.

Candrakīrti observes:

"It is said ''There are persons for one vehicle and three,' but ultimately, there is only one vehicle. The teaching of Śrāvakayāna, Pratyekabuddhayāna and Mahāyāna is for the purpose of introducing sentient beings."

He then clarifies what this means for him: 

Because there are no divisions in the dharmadhātu, those [three] were explained for introducing [sentient beings]. Ārya Nāgārjuna states:

Because there are no divisions in the dharmadhātu, 
there are no divisions in vehicles;
the teaching of three vehicles
is for introducing sentient beings.

In that case, since the dharmadhātu is uniform, and because śrāvakas and so on do not differentiate the dharmadhātu, the vehicle is only one. Since there is traversing, there is a so-called vehicle, and because the absence of an entity of self of śrāvakas and so one are the same, there is one vehicle. Since this is traversed, it is a vehicle. Since they are equivalent in liberation, there is one vehicle."

Candra then goes on to point out that Yogacārins like Maitreyanatha regard the one vehicle teaching as interpretable and not definitive. He summarizes his statement however by stating, "As such, the character of the Mahāyāna is established as the Ekayāna." In other words, Candra defines the one vehicle from the standpoint of reality, the dharmadhātu, and since reality is one, the means of realizing it must all be the same. 

In other words, for Madhyamaka, Mahāyāna is the Ekayāna, there is no Ekayāna apart from Mahāyāna. This is basically how the Ekayāna is understood in Tibet as well, since we are all Madhyamaka here, of the Prasaṅga variety, apart from some people that follow gzhan stong.

We don't even need to discuss Yoga, Samkhya, etc., since these darshanas have been well refuted. I've studied these things with Hindu masters of them, they have no problem with the incompatibility of Buddhadharma with Samkhya and Advaita, or the incompatibility of Advaita witn Samkhya and Buddhadharma and so on.

Dependent origination is rejected by all Advaitans because the logic of dependent origination does not permit one to advance an ontologically meaningful nondualism. 

"Nondual" in Mahāyāna means either the absence of outer objects or it means the absence of the basic pair of existence and nonexistence.

That means the rhetoric is in the way. It is one of the problems Gelugpas have with Pabhongakha, actually. Non-Gelugpas just can't forget that Pabhongkha stated in his letters, that all other Buddhists apart from his school were all going to hell, and so on. Then Gelugpas get mad and claim we are getting hung up on rhetoric. Moreover, there are more than just a few Gelugpas who double down on the rhetoric, and I see the same thing happening among Nichirenistas. This is complicated by the fact that Nichiren Buddhism itself has a complicated history, with factions and differing ideologies, from peaceful drum bangers who build Nirvana Stupas around to the world, to aggressive street preachers (at least there were in the '80's).

This is absolutely correct, but there is a right way to arrive at this view of no view, and a wrong way. 

The right way is to analyze phenomena and find that there are no phenomena which stand up to analysis. The wrong way is to take this "no view" as a statement of dogma and start barking it at everything you see. 

Now, in the West we have many people training in Zen who do not even know the rudiments of Buddhadharma. This was not the case in China and Japan, where Zen/Chan training was engaged in by people who were well trained in Sūtra, Abhidharma, and so on. 

So, it is not surprising in the least that in Zen circles there are people who are unable to distinguish at all what is Buddhadharma and why it is truly unique in the world. The same thing is true of Vipassana.

With respect to the nature of reality, all other religious understanding of it is wrong. If you believe otherwise, this means that you also believe that awakening has nothing to do with view. That is knowledge obscuration I hope you someday overcome. There is no common basis between Buddhadharma and tirthīka religions. HH Dalai Lama happily admits this, and with a grin, for example, is happy to state "When my Christian brothers want to talk to me about emptiness, I tell them emptiness is not their business."

This does not mean that all world religions are not based in some sense of moral responsibility and compassion for others, but compassion cannot eradicate afflictions which cause rebirth.

Because matter…is a phenomena that is impermanent, unstable, transient and changing, this Mahāyāna Dharma is able to overwhelm the world with its devas, humans, asuras and gandharvas.

Why? It is because of the innate grasping at a nonexistent self which has not been eradicated by the realization of the emptiness of persons and phenomena that liberation cannot arise spontaneously. Since every other religion posits some kind of self as an ultimate reality, liberation is not possible for them.

Of course, many sentient beings have different karma, and thus follow many paths, but without right view, liberation just is not possible. That right view exists only in Buddhadharma. 

If liberation does not come from right view, than liberation has no cause and can arise at any time in anyone, whether they realized emptiness or not.

My attitude is that Buddhadharma is very precise. It is easy to measure what is in accordance with Buddhadharma and what is not. This is a forum for discussing that. Therefore, if someone offers a view that absolutely contradicts Buddhadharma, it is quite permissible, and even desirable, for that contradiction to be pointed out. I generally find that in the end people appreciate being corrected, even if in the beginning they are a little offended.

No Mind explained his perspective right at the outset. It is mistaken. If no one sets him straight, he will continue in that misconception. 

It is no more kind to allow someone to continue in a misconception than it is to allow a lost traveller to continue on their way without pointing out the correct path to their destination.

The aim of precision about this point is to eliminate the concepts that lead to grasping and clinging. 

One does not eliminate views by proffering more views. 

Dependent origination itself is the elimination of views. No Mind should understand this point a little better than he does at present.

And just to be clear, Nāgārjuna states:

Whatever is the nature of the Tathāgata, that is the nature of the world. 
Since the Tathāgata has no nature, the world too has no nature.

The Blessed One said, "What is the All? Simply the eye &amp; forms, ear &amp; sounds, nose &amp; aromas, tongue &amp; flavors, body &amp; tactile sensations, intellect &amp; ideas. This, monks, is called the All. [1] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because it lies beyond range."

Āryadeva states quite clear that realization is based on view. It is not diminishing other paths to point out that the Buddadharma is unique with respect to this view of empty dependent origination, and that from this perspective, it is not possible to be free from the afflictions that drive rebirth without realizing the meaning of empty dependent origination. We also do not need to apologize for asserting that without the eightfold path, liberation is not possible. We can also acknowledge that other paths have different baseline assumptions that are at odds with ours, have visions of liberation which are not consistent with ours, and therefore, propose results which are not commensurate with ours.

There are remnants of this in Tibetan culture in the form of rgyal po spirits -- almost every Tibetan family has something like this. But it is not part of Buddhadharma, it is a hangover from pre-buddhist Tibetan folk religion, and I suspect that it is the same in China, and Japan. In Shinto, there is definitely an idea of ancestor veneration in the form of the Kami.

This is too narrow a definition. If you are practicing practices characteristic of Dzogchen, etc., then you are a Dzogchen practitioner. 

For example, if you are solely a practitioner of Lamdre, you are not a Dzogchen practitioner. On the other hand, there is no difference in meaning between Dzogchen trekcho, Kagyu Mahamudra, the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, etc.

I happen to agree with you, which is why the Trump Presidency is such a shame. He has disowned the economic and political stability the US afforded the world (despite a sometimes checkered foreign policy) and has actively aided and abetted the forces of illiberalism to rise to the forefront. But part of that stability was assured because the Soviets and the Chinese had closed economies, and the US dominated the world in trade. With opening of China and the downfall of the Soviet Union, globalization has had the predictable effect of transitioning manufacturing jobs to cheaper labor markets without providing many Americans with jobs in their place. But the ridiculous rhetoric of the Trump administration has been neatly refuted by Dave Chapelle, who pointed out we don't want jobs "to come back" from China because we don't want $9,000 Iphones and $1000 NIkes. 

Global trade liberalization is a fact, and we can do it well or poorly, but we cannot sit out the game.

Means you need to make a serkyem for the offerings also. Sang and serkhyem are commonly done in the morning, after which one has a tea break with tea prepared for the rite. 

When doing serkhyem in the evening, one also needs to have cups set out for the participants so they all have a little wine at the end. If doing intense Ngaggong or something, you need to take breaks, and during breaks, one has a drink -- this is the mthong brgyud, the seeing lineage.

Sorry, but if you are referring to the United States, our country was built on slavery and ethnic cleansing by a European minority whose only virtue was creating civil institutions that were able to evolve (albeit imperfectly) beyond the narrow limits imagined by the founders. So lets not get carried away with all the freedom fighting rhetoric. I personally think that democracy based on liberal economics is the way to go, but lets not kid ourselves into thinking that the US is some paragon of virtue. It really isn't. 

Yes, we need police and an army, or course, and yes, like any country, the US has a right to defend itself. The Buddha said:

 This, dear son, that you, leaning on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting and revering it, doing homage to it, hallowing it, being yourself a Dhamma-banner, a Dhamma-signal, having the Dhamma as your master, should provide the right watch, ward and protection for your own folk, for the army, for the nobles, for vassals and brahmans and householders, for town and country dwellers, for the religious world and for beasts and birds.

The Buddha observed that if a country is in the side of virtue, any attack against it will be unsuccessful:

5. And the Blessed One addressed the brahman Vassakara in these words: "Once, brahman, I dwelt at Vesali, at the Sarandada shrine, and there it was that I taught the Vajjis these seven conditions leading to (a nation's) welfare. [5] So long, brahman, as these endure among the Vajjis, and the Vajjis are known for it, their growth is to be expected, not their decline."

Thereupon the brahman Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed One: "If the Vajjis, Venerable Gotama, were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare, their growth would have to be expected, not their decline. What then of all the seven? No harm, indeed, can be done to the Vajjis in battle by Magadha's king, Ajatasattu, except through treachery or discord. Well, then, Venerable Gotama, we will take our leave, for we have much to perform, much work to do."

"Do as now seems fit to you, brahman." And the brahman Vassakara, the chief minister of Magadha, approving of the Blessed One's words and delighted by them, rose from his seat and departed.



Victory is suffering:

Victory breeds hatred,
The defeated live in pain.
Happily the peaceful live,
Giving up victory and defeat.

Dhp. v. 201


The Buddha in fact recommends social welfare, unlike the present policies of this adminstration:


But perchance his majesty might think: "I'll soon put a stop to these scoundrels' game by degradation and banishment and fines and bonds and death." But their license cannot be satisfactorily put a stop to so. The remnant left unpunished would still go on harassing the realm. Now there is one method to adopt to put a thorough end to this disorder. Whosoever there be in the king's realm who devote themselves to keeping cattle and the farm, to them let his majesty give food and seed corn. Whosoever there be in the king's realm who devote themselves to trade, to them let his majesty give capital. Whosoever there be in the king's realm who devote themselves to government service, to them let his majesty give wages and food. Then those men, following each his own business, will no longer harass the realm; the king's revenue will go up; the country will be quiet and at peace; and the populace pleased with one another and happy, dancing their children in their arms, will dwell with open doors.


In other words, Roosevelt's New Deal, Johnson's Great Society, Obama's Quantitative Easing policies and Obamacare are precisely the kind of policies the Buddha recommends for a peaceful society. 

It is the neglect of the poor that Buddha describes as the downfall of society:

Thus from goods not being bestowed on the destitute, poverty... stealing... violence... murder... lying... evil-speaking... immorality grew rife.
Theft and killing lead to false speech, jealousy, adultery, incest and perverted lust...

Everything above comes from https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/aut ... tml#fnt-45. 

The Buddha said nothing in Mahāyāna sūtras that adds anything to this at all.

Yes, I am quite sure. Hand bells, thighbone trumpets, and damarus, yes, these come from India. 

 The rest, the massive horns (dung chen), the large drums (rnga chen), the misnamed rgya ling (Indian horn) is actually a sorna, of Persian origin. The cymbal is definitely of Persian/Central Asian origin, called sil snyan in Tibetan. Then the is the Bonpo bell called a Shang (Zang in Persian) and so on. 

The reason for this is simple. Tibetan adopted Nestorian monastic customs and hierarchies in Tibetan monasteries. Persia was the major cultural influence on Western Tibet, aka Zhang Zhung empire, where power in the Himalayas was concentrated until the 7th century with the rise of the Yarlung Dynasty.

There is no teaching of dependent origination outside Buddhadharma. It is the Buddha's unique teaching, and does not exist in other traditons, and is in fact explicitly rejected in the source texts of Advaita and so on, fiercely rejected by Shankaracarya, etc.

I really cannot know what this person you refer to taught. But if they taught there was some truly existent ultimate reality then they were not teaching from the view point of dependent origination. No one who accepts and teaches dependent origination accepts there is such a reality. 

The Samkhya teachings, which are the underlying structure for Hindu teachings in general, have something which might seem to be dependent origination, but it isn't.
