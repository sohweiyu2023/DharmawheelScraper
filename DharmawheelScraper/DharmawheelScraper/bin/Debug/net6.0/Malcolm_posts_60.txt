Moxa will reduce the swelling immediately -- provided it is not an inflamation/infection. Otherwise try cold compresses. Way to find out is apply hot, see it is more comfortable. If not, then apply cold. Or reverse. whichever your instinct sends you. Then, apply corresponding diet and behavior.

if it is red an angry looking, it is probably hot. If not, cold.

Oh, it is simple. Norbu RInpoche wrote a long commentary when he was younger. Later on, when he had a chance to obtain all of Adzom Drugpa's collected works, he chanced to find a text in Adzom's collected works that was for over a hundred pages identical in topic, outline and structure. Apart from minor differences in in grammar, the words are the same. 

Based on that, Norbu Rinpoche himself decided that it must be true that he is the reincarnation of Adzom Drugpa. 

Adzom Drugpa was the most important Dzogchen Guru of the early twentieth century for many reasons, not least of which he was the main Dzogchen disciple of Khyentse Wangpo. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is the most important Dzogchen master alive today. Of course, there are many Dzogchen masters, and to their own students, they are the most important. But in terms of service in spreading Unsurpassed Secret Treasury of Mahasaṃdhi teachings, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is in truth the Second Vajrasattva.

Dzogchen is a personal experience of one's actual state. For that you simply need someone who has that knowledge to show you the same. It is not something you will ever figure out on your own. That is your limitation, not the limitation of the teachings. 

It is for example like a begger who uses a rock for a pillow, never dreaming that inside the rock is a precious diamond.

Buddhism is a vast tree planted in the soil of India, which shot out runners in many different directions. All of our Buddhist teachings are shoots from that tree, at least in this era. There were other Buddhas, other eras. But root, trunk, branch, leaf, and flower all lead to but one result. Awakening. And that is the most important thing to recall when conversing and discussing with our fellow Buddhists.

Content:
Troy existed  900 years before the Illiad and for 2600 hundred years all we knew of it was a story -- then someone tracked the story down and found a city buried where the story said it would be three thousand years later. 

There certainly was a religion in Tibet we can call "Bon" prior to Buddhism. The first Tibetan king live circa 120 BCE. Prior to that there were many generations of Zhang Zhung kings. Zhang Zhung fell not because of Tibetan aggression -- the kingdom of Zhang Zhung failed because of overgrazing and climate change (for which there is both archaeological evidence and climate evidence). 

Bon claims to had a transmission of Dzogchen, etc.,, independent of Shakyamuni Buddha and Garab Dorje's lineage according to their tradition coming from a teacher Shenrab Miwoche. They place the origin of Tonpa Shenrab in Western Central Asia. 
This is reasonable since it is a certainty that the Zhang Zhung people migrated to the high plateau of western Tibet from somewhere else, most likely the west and they were not Tibetan, so did not come into Tibet through the low country in Kongpo like the early Tibetan tribes. 

After the fall of Zhang Zhung, some Zhang Zhung people continued to migrate east into eastern Tibet and western China, settling in the border lands there. The Naxi people are among the remnants of this migration. 

Some Zhang Zhung people stayed behind and moved south into the lower more fertile valleys around Kinnaur. There exists is a small population that continues to speak a descendent of Zhang Zhung language. In my opinion, because Tibetan became the dominant tongue in Western Tibet, the Zhang Zhung people lost their original grammar and thus the small Kinnauri population that speak "Zhang Zhung dialect" of Tibetan now speak a kind of colonial patois of Tibetan with many Zhang Zhung words. 

The real facts are lost to history. But we can respect Yungdrung Bon as a fellow tradition that shares the ideals, goals, and essential doctrines of Buddhism. We also should respect Bon because it is important to Tibetan culture. 

Did Bon borrow extensively from Buddhism? well, in my opinion, it is very likely. Does this matter? No. Does it matter if it can all be pinned down definitively? No. Do Bonpos attain liberation through Dzogchen teachings? Yes. That, in the end, is all that matters (if you are a Dzogchen practitioner). 

Do people sometimes get confused about all this? Often. Is Buddhist behavior towards Bon often despicable? Yes.

Yes -- here is a general guideline for men. Though this has changed a bit with modern diet and availability of foods around the seasons from all over the world, there are still some trends we can observe -- when it is hot, we tend to eat much lighter and lighter, less nutritious food, and when it is cold, we eat heavier, oilier, more nutritious food. When people ate according to the cycle of the year, this was much more pronounced. Therefore, in the winter months, when it is cold and one is eating a lot of heavy food, one can ejaculate as much as five times a day with no health problem. As one moves through spring, this reduces to every two days, and finally in summer only every two weeks. When one starts to increase one's intake of nutritious foods in the fall through harvest and slaughter season (which happens in late fall in Tibet), then one can increase to every other day. 

Now, if someone is depleted, they should not have sex because in this case, as in summer, one loses a little ojas with ejaculation. If one is healthy, winter time, eating well, etc., there is no danger of losing ojas because one has excess. 

While women do not have the same issue -- menstruation can be a cause of depleting ojas if they are not careful with their diet. 

Ojas is mainly depleted by stress. A lot of autoimmune disorders come from depleted ojas because of modern lifestyle.

The basic difference is as follows. With Dzogchen, right in the very beginning your primordial state is pointed out to you with words, symbols and personal experience. You then work with this, integrating into this knowledge. 

In Zen, you practice for many years, discover your real nature, awaken, and then your awakening is signed off on by an awakened master, someone who is capable of recognizing the experience you have had and verifying it for you. 

So, completely different.

I should clarify that there are lots of different traditions of "pointing out". And the way "pointing out" is done in Dzogchen is very different than the way it is done in Mahāmudrā -- the latter is far more gradual, in general.

It is a little hard to as Tibetans to come up with a different translation for theg dman or theg che chung. 

It is equally naive to pretend that Tibetans did not understand that these terms included Theravadins. You might want to argue Tibetans had very little experience with Theravadins. And this is so to an extent -- but Tibetans were not completely unaware of their neighbors, were aware of Burma (part of the region Tibetans call Mon yul which extends from Bhutan to roughly the Irrawady), etc. and were certainly aware of Nikāya/Agamic monks in India and their tenets. 

But the thing is, the term nyan thos (śravaka) suffers not so well either in hands of Tibetan commentators being another catch phrase for "those who just don't get it". 

I don't think you will ever get any Tibetan master to agree that the realization of an arhat is functionally equivalent to that of a Buddha. Just as you will not find any Sakya or Nyingmapa agreeing that common Mahāyān is capable of producing complete buddhahood either. 

Theravadins are considered to be substantialist by Tibetan Buddhists. 

In the end, the best we can do is agree on the basic principles of Buddha's teachings and leave it at that and try to collaborate despite our differences, since there are not many Buddhists in the world, and many in other religious and secular ideologies who would happily see Buddhism as a whole destroyed.

There are two ways to explain this -- one discusses three ignorance:  innate, resembling the cause, and imputing ignorances respectively alternately, one discusses two ignorances, innate and imputing. I will stick with the latter explanation for ease. 



When the basis arises out of the basis, i.e. when the five lights of wisdom are stirred by vāyu after the shell of the youthful vase body is rent there is a neutral awareness [shes pa lung ma bstan] that does not recognize itself. That simple non-recognition is the innate ignorance. That neutral awareness has two options either it recognizes itself [vidyā], becoming Samantabhadra, or it does not, and through imputing self and other onto the appearance of the basis, creating samsara. That imputation of self and other is the imputing ignorance. 

Most people do not realize that Samantabhadra initially possessed the first ignorance. He never possessed the second. 

Important point: the nature of the two or three ignorances are the same.

I would suggest that the usage of "hīna" hīnayāna, while derogatory, is derogatory primarily  in one of its specific senses you can easily find in the Pali Dictionary -- i.e. hīnāya āvattati, to turn to the lower, to give up orders, return to secular life. 

From a Mahāyāna point of view, rejecting Mahāyāna is exactly "turning to the lower" in exactly the same sense that it was used in Pali canon. 

There is no question that in Tibetan Buddhism, all Nikāya tenet systems are regarded as inferior and flawed by substantialism of one kind or another, and the Nikayas/Agamas, incomplete and provisional. 

In other words, Mahayanists had very specific ideas about Buddhahood and found those that did not agree with them wanting in their understanding.

Sean, my point is that it is quite possible that meaning of the teachings adinatha is talking about are just different terms for essentially the same principle. 

Anyway, what I mentioned above is the statement of KDL. KDL was a Buddha, someone who finished all four visions and realized rainbow body. 

This is a Buddha that we both knew personally.

He can disagree if he wants -- if he wants to call samadhi "chulen" it is fine by me. What is more likely the case is that there is just a different emphasis, different terminology. I don't think that Jigten Sumgon was a recipient of many Dzogchen teachings. But I am not completely sure. 

Things like qualities of food are explained very well in Ayurveda and so on. He was unlikely to have had much exposure to the Four Tantras tradition of Tibetan Medicine, because at that point is was still a family lineage in the Yuthok clan. He was a little younger than Yuthok. Tibetan Medicine originally was very secret, and is connected with Dzogchen as well. But like any educated Lama of his day, he certainly had access to various medical traditions and chulen traditions coming from India like the Amrita siddhi tradition.

Longchenpa terms it chulen of cittavāyu (rlung sems). This is taught in the sgra thal gyur.

No, living off the essence of vāyu is dharmakāya chulen. I.e. you are taking the pure five elements directly from breath. 

Chulen of space is what we are taking about since space is the basis of the other four elements. It means the same thing. But in order to so this in a pure way one must build up through nirmanakāya and sambhogakāya chulen, respectively eating a sattvic diet combined with pills, in the second eating only pills, and perhaps flowers -- there are variations. 

This chulen of space is the an important supporting condition of body of light realization.

it is important because in order to achieve rainbow body one must purify the body through rasāyana. For example, prior to attaining rainbow body, Ngala Pema Dudul was living merely off of essence of vāyu in addition to drinking a little water for the last three or four years of his life.

The practice of chulen is most important in Dzogchen.

Yes, that is correct. Actually, there is more to it than that. Ojas is the final product of digesting food. So, for this reason one needs to periodically do cleanses, and engage in the practice of rasāyana. This is more effective than mere celibacy because you are cleansing the digestive channels and tract, increasing your ability to absorb rasa, the broken down food, and then having a fairly pure diet where one is mainly relying on essence foods such as ghee and honey, with a sattvic diet. 

The whole point of Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine is to refine and purify ojas in the body for longevity etc. In Tibetan the term ojas is translated as "mdangs".

Well, it is because our visualization of our bodies as deities also does not correspond to our bodies in a real sense either. For example, when we visualize ourselves as Vajrasattva, in Vajrasattvas body there is no heart, no lungs, no liver, spleen/pancreas or kidney, no stomach, intestines, gall bladder, urinary bladder, ovaries or seminal vesicle, etc. 

We primarily use the three channels as a visualization guide for the prāṇa vāyu in our bodies that we breath in. For example, we use the visualization of the lower ends of the three channels to focus our attention below the belly, for example -- through muscular contraction of the mulabandha and the uddiyāna bandhas we collect and force vāyu into arterial system and cause it to supersaturate our cells, capillaries, etc. with vāyu and ojas (the real bodhicitta element within our body) that it pumps. Simultaneously, our heart rate slows, and this means for a time not only is our consciousness "slowing down" i.e. because the karma vāyus are now suspended, but the venous blood is returning less impurities into the blood stream temporarily while the ojas is flushing and restoring the cells. This is why Khumbaka, for example, is the hidden secret to longevity in both Hatha Yoga of the Nathas, and in Vajrayāna. Through the two lower locks, we slow blood flow into the vena cava, saturate blood with prāṇa vāyu and send it into the arteries, etc. Ojas itself has two stores within the body -- the heart and also the brain. This is why we do the visualization of blazing and dripping, etc.

This is just a rough approximation.

In Sakya, for example, they place great emphasis on visualizing the channels very precisely. In Dzogchen, according to the Khandro Nyinthig, it is enough to have an idea of the channels. The same is true for deity yoga and the same difference applies. 

However, you must apply the method of the system you are practicing. So for example, of you are practicing Naro Khachö it is considered very important to have a very precise visualization, very clear, very vivid. You apply the method of the school which you are following at any given time for any given practice.

Longchepa also writes in the Ocean of Liberation from the Lama Yangthig:

"Now then, although there is nothing to damage or transgress, the natural great perfection being beyond a boundary to protect, since it is necessary for yogins on the path of practice to abide in commitments, in order to purify one’s continuum there are the three root commitments.There are twenty five branch commitments as well i.e. what to understand, what not to avoid,what to adopt, how to act, what to accomplish which are taught in the great tantras. The branch comittments are taught as mere assistants for protecting the root commitments since they possess accepting and rejecting, effort and practice."

This itself is a commentary on the more elaborate commentary concerning Dzogchen samaya in the Vima sNying thig, the Analysis of Samaya. It says:

"If one dwells in the samayas of the body, it will not be difficult to obtain the unchanging body vajra of all the buddas. If one dwells in the samayas of the voice, it will not be difficult to obtain the unchanging speech vajra of all the buddas. If one dwells in the samayas of the mind, it will not be difficult to obtain the unchanging mind vajra of all the buddas."

As for Greg's point, Longchenpa here states that among the 27 root commitments (9*3):

"The outer of the inner [is not to ridicule] speaking the words of the teachings..."

This certainly means that while one may not find a given passage relevant to one's own condition, one should not hubristically dismiss the teachings of the Buddha as if they are as you put it "...from a deluded perspective." All Buddhist teachings are for deluded people, yes, even all Dzogchen texts. From that perspective, even Dzogchen tantras are from a deluded perspective. This is not to say of course there are not teachings for people of greater and lesser delusion. This is not to say that we need to follow Nikaya teachings as if they are of the same value as Dzogchen teachings, etc. But that depends on the practitioner. If someone does not have transmission, than all Dzogchen texts are meaningless aside from being used as bhakti objects. 

Undeluded people do not need teachings of any kind. They also are in great or total samaya, always. total samaya is just another word for "dzogchen", mahāsaṃdhi or santimāha in the lanuage of Oḍḍiyāna.

A channel is a channel: veins, arteries and nerves. You can add to this the lymphatic system, though they are considered to act as a support for bring moisture to the nervous system among their other functions. 

A cakra in this view is any place in the body where there are clusters of arteries, veins and nerves. You can readily see five such clusters in the body. There are many more. 

The channels we visualize are just a method -- why? because when we are visualizing ourselves as a deity, we visualize our bodies as completely hollow, made of light, with no internal organs. 

The explicitly stated point of view of Tibetan Medicine is that the avadhūtī is all channels of air i.e. arteries; the rasanā is all channels of fire i.e. the blood vessels, and the lalanā all channels of water i.e. the nerves in the body. This is detailed at length by Zurkhar Lodo Gyalpo, is based primarily on the understanding of the anatomy of the body indicated by the Third Karmapa in his Zabmo Nangdon and reinforced by Desrid Sangye Gyatso. The latter two were both great Dzogchen masters as well though, Zurkharwa was not. 

For example, the Kagyu Historian, Thubten Phunstog, has written an interesting commentaries on Tibetan Medicine, Six Yogas of Naropa, and well as Zabmo Nangdon. He makes the case that if channels are not physical structures in the body, then practices like gtum mo would have no effect. Then there is the very interesting doctor in Golok, Menpa Tenzin, who wrote a book based on doing many years of dissection of cadavers which contain very detailed drawings of his research. One may think this unnecessary given Netter's Anatomy and so on, but it is interesting -- and his dissections were guided from a Tibetan Medical perspective. He really explained this principle to us very well when we are interning in Xining. He is a disciple of Khenpo Munsel and In Tibet, he is a well respected Dzogchen master. 

In reality, the three channels meet in each of these five (or six) locations in the body, according to the presentation I gave above from Kalackara. This simply means you will find clusters of arteries, veins and nerves at these locations in the body. Again, to restate, when we are doing deity yoga, our bodies are conceived to be hollow -- thus we visualize the channels in various ways depending on what system we are practicing. Hence, according Menpa Tenzin, et al, our visualization does not correspond with the manner in which the three channels actually exist in the body, and more importantly, it does not need to. 

The reasons behind this again become very clear when one studies embryology according to Tibetan Medicine, Kalacakra, or Dzogchen Nyinthig. A very good book on this subject has been published by Francis Garret. 

However, again, in the West, our idea of ṇāḍis has been very influenced by the acupuncture idea of "meridians" as well as Hindu ideas of cakras and ṇāḍis. The Upanishadic idea of cakras and ṇāḍis is related to the concept of pañcakośa originating in the Taittiriya Upanisha  (which makes this idea a bit older than the Buddha's teaching), where they are explicitly connected with the prāṇamayakośa. On the other hand, the Upanishads are very important to understand, because they contain many ideas and concepts which reappear in altered form (i.e. revised in accordance with Buddha ideas) in Vajrayāna, Ayurveda/Tibetan Medicine, and even in Dzogchen.

Tsang Nyong Heruka's bio of Mila is an inspired piece of historical fiction based on the many oral traditions he collected travelling all over the Himalayan regions where Milarepa wandered. While I have no doubt that Mila adopted the Tsheringma sisters as guardians since the presence of the five Tseringma sisters as guardians in the Kagyu school is well attested, I don't see any reason to accept Tsang Nyon's narratives at face value. 

Further, the permission ritual of Tseringma in the Kagyu sNgags mDzod clearly explains how Padmasambhava bound Tseringma under the secret name "Vajrasamantabhadri", and later how in particular Tseringma was made a specific guardian of Kagyu school by Milarepa. 

As I read the account given in this permission ritual, Tseringma was testing Milarepa's yogic ability. 

Finally, there is no contradiction between stating, for example, "...among non-human disciples, Tseringma was Milarepa's chief student" and understanding that the twelve tenma were Dzogchen guardians from the beginning. 

Generally, however, for Dzogchen, among the twelve Tenma, Dorje Yudronma is regarded as more important. For the Kagyus, Tseringma is more important.

You cannot separate the pure sadhadhatu (wisdom and five lights) from the impure sadadhātu (consciousness and five elements). The difference is only vidyā or avidyā.

The sadadhātu are a model that is capable of encompassing any state of matter or mind, no matter how subtle or gross, macro, micro, nano, subatomic, etc. 

It is inconsistent to say that the five elements function at the macro level of matter and are irrelevant at the subatomic level. The five elements are properties of all matter, period. The medicine tantra states:

"No formation without earth, no cohesion without water, no maturation without fire, no development without air, and no room for development without space."

If you want to go further, we could discuss how these gross expressions of the sadadhātu have their corollaries in terms of wisdom and the five lights.

My claim is that the winds in the body are based on the process of respiration. I never asserted that they do not undergo change and refinement in the body, of course they do. The function of the lungs is to bring air into body and pass it into the channels, refining it along the way. This vāyu, like any other of the four elements that are taken up by the body, undergoes a process of digestion. Breath is a kind of food. This is why we have rasāyanas of air, which involve prāṇayāma practices to extract the rasa of the vāyu directly and so on. 

Anyway, this understanding comes from Tibetan Medicine. For example, one of my teachers, Tamdrin Gyal from Amdo, when explaining topics from Rangjung Dorje's famed Zabmo Nangdon to us asserted that while the vāyu/vatta of the body comes from external element of air conducted into the body through breathing, the air element outside the of body does not possess all seven characteristics of vāyu present in the body i.e, rough, light, cold, motile, subtle and hard. 

When we talk about the five elements in the body, we always refer to them as the five refined elements. But, for example, Padmsambhava is very clear that the five refined elements in the body come from the five gross elements upon which we depend for life.

Do you have a citation for this? 

The meaning of prāṇa is "life". If there life in the sun? 

The Vajramālā states very plainly:

The characteristic of the the element of air (vāyu)
is the vāyu (air) pervading the six cakras,
always present in the dharmacakra,
called prāṇa since it pervades migrating beings"

And:

The wheel of vāyu is explained to be prāṇa.

And apropos of the Kalacakra citation in the last post it states:

Depending on upper or lower,
the major vāyus, prāṇa and apana are located.

Prāṇa vāyu is furthere defined in this text:

From the traces of the all-basis consciousness
arises the stream of consciousness;
the affliction [consciousness] is the prāṇa vāyu.

So at least in Buddhist texts these things are very precisely defined.

We are not communicating well. 

That flatus is the downward voiding wind is a fact. The apana-vāyu is also responsible for moving liquids out of the body such as sperm, urine and so forth, as well as solids such as feces. It's location in the body is the pelvic region. 

There is a passage in the Kalacakra that describes the anus as being the lower end of the central channel. The famous Doctor Zurkar Lodo Gyalpo explains the following in his "Oral Advice of the Grandfathers",  his commentary on the formation of the body chapter in the Explanatory Medicine Tantra

This verse (from the Explanatory Tantra) "The channels of formation divide into three from the navel" demonstrates the lalanā, rasanā and the lower end of the avadhūtī. The channel that creates kapha, etc., is the lalanā through which the element of water moves. The channel that creates blood and so on is the rasanā through which the element of fire moves. The channel that creates vāyu and so on is the lower part of the avadhūti. The lower ends of the rasanā and lalanā are demonstrated through implication. These three tips both below and above the navel are applied according to the intention of the Shri Kalacakra i.e. the Adibuddha states:

Those have three tips below,
likewise, three tips above. 
The tip of Rahu is present in the center,
the tip of Surya is on the right,
the tip of Candra is on the left. 
The vāyus of water, fire and space
move feces, urine, and sukra
through the bottom of the right, left, and central [channels].
The channels interlaced like a chain
are the three pathways of the prāṇa and the apaṇa.

The great commentary states "In terms of the the so called 'channel interlaced into a chain which runs to the location of amrita', the amritaṇāḍī is in forehead. "Moving there" is moving into the location of amrita i.e. the lalanā, the rasanā, and the avadhūtī. Since those are interlaced like a chain, having made three pathways between the navel and the heart, once again they intersect in the center of the heart in the center of the avadhūtī. The lalanā and the rasanā move to the right and left sides. After that, between the heart and the throat, they make three paths. In the same way they are three paths between the throat and the forehead, and likewise between the forehead and crown. Having made three paths four times, the lalanā ends in twelve different locations other from the left nostril. The rasanā from the right (nostril). The avadhūtī leaves simultaneously from both nostrils. Likewise, having made three paths below the navel and again below the secret cakra, between feces and urine moving from the right and the left, and in the center of the secret lotus there is the conch nāḍī. Below the conch nāḍī, the mahāmalā (great waste i.e. rectum) channel moves from the center. From penis or the vagina, the urine channel moves from the left, and the seminal channelfrom right."


Incidentally, in the Blue Beryl, Desri Sangye Gyatso reproduces the above passage more or less in its entirety without comment. 

I should think the meaning of all of this is rather clear. 

There are three vāyus that are subsets of the apana vāyu. The apāna vāyu in general governs the lower ends of the three channels. The three lower channels are the rectum i.e. the lower end of the central channel; the urinary tract i.e. the lower end of the lalanā, and the channel which emits semen or ovum i..e the lower end of the rasanā channel.

When someone has an excess of apana vāyu, they fart, or have diarrhea, etc. There are many disorders they have have connected with the three lower passages. We take wind in, some of it is expelled from the lower end of the body as flatus. 

However, I will allow that my understanding of many tantric topics has been altered considerably through my studies of Tibetan medicine.

There are five elements: earth, water, fire, air and space -- they are material, whether coarse or subtle. 

When transmigration happens at the time of death, the mind/wind leaves specific orifices of the body, or channel openings. This would bot be necessary if the wind upon which the mind is mounted was not itself physical and material. 

For example, when you have flatulence, this comes from the apana vāyu, the downward-voiding wind. That flatus is apana-vāyu. 

Vāyu in the body is coarse or subtle depending upon how much it is moving. But it is still something physical, part of the rūpa skandha. 

If you cannot accept this explanation, then you have to invent terms that do not exist in the original Tibetan and Sanskrit texts, such as the Vajramālā tantra that explain things like vāyus and so on. 

I prefer to not to interpolate new age ideas onto Vajrayāna. So, I accept that vāyu in the body comes from the breath. If you think about it long enough, you will understand that I am correct. You need to study tantric embryology. When you do, this will make more sense to you.

You have a lot of karmic connection with Dzogchen. But you can screw it up in three ways: not protecting your samaya, not practicing in a careful and precise way, and giving too much weight to conceptual experiences.

Well, we don't breath anything else, do we? 

What flows through the channels in our body is vāyu (air) that has been refined in our lungs. 

Otherwise, practices like caṇdali yoga would make no sense, would they? 

prāṇa is a vāyu i.e. prāṇa vāyu (srog dzin rlung) aka "the life sustaining wind". This comes from our breath and no where else.

Vāyu is part of the rūpa skandha. It is one of the four mahābhutani, great elements. When we breath in, the air we breath is vāyu. In the body, that vāyu that we breath in becomes the ten vāyus depending on how vāyu is functioning in a given part of the body. 

This is nothing mysterious. Unfortunately, Buddhists have been unwittingly influenced by new age concepts about channels, cakras and so on.

KDL was a terton, so of course it is not unusual for tertons to have many experiences of visions of Guru Rinpoche even at quite a young age. 

Nevertheless, it was not until he met his own root Guru, Dudjom Rinpoche, that his capacity to reveal termas was opened in this lifetime. Had he met the right consort, he would have had many earth termas, but there was an obstacle and so it did not happen. Nevertheless, he had many dgongs gter.  

Having visions of Guru Rinpoche, as KDL did throughout his life, does not necessarily mean one is receiving teachings. However, KDL told me that he could communicate directly with Guru R. Of course, KDL was someone who had reached the complete end of the Dzogchen path. So this should not come as a surprise.

Because the song of the vajra has another name "The primordial state of Samantabhadra". 

When relying on a non-conceptual continuum,
at this time one should sing...
If concentration is not occurring for someone,
with this it occurs naturally...
When a yogin has lethargy,
when revived with this, samadhi is excellent...
Therefore, sing the song of the vajra.
-- Tantra of the Union of the Sun and Moon. 

Song of the Vajra is ChNN's main practice.

That is correct, there are many different versions of the Song of the Vajra, in many different termas. They all share basic characteristics, however. 

The one ChNN uses is more or less identical to the version Longchenpa presents in the Theg mchog mdzod apart from one or two syllables, differences that can be accounted for through scribal transcription errors from umed to uchen when the original blocs were prepared.

I guess I am not explaining this clearly: dzogchen view is the ultimate freedom from grasping, quite beyond sūtra.

The only difference between wind in your body and wind outside your body is that it is in your body. There is no "energy" apart from vāyu. There are ten vāyus. The less those vāyus move in the body, the more subtle the mind becomes. 

I don't think adding the term "energvy" makes the concept about what is happening in the human body any clearer, and rather more muddled.

From the point of view of someone who understands the real meaning of Dzogchen, everything looks like Dzogchen, even nursery rhymes. 

But this does not mean that the Bible contains some profound insight in Dzogchen. 

In this case it is a question of what kind of glasses you have on. If you are wearing Dzogchen glasses everything can seem like Dzogchen. 

But it is funny, ChNN occasionally says things like this, and IMO, immediately people completely misunderstand the meaning he is trying to convey. 

He certainly does not mean that there are secret Dzogchen practitioners in the Catholic or Lutheran Church from time immemorial.

No need to add "energy" to winds. The composition of vāyus is vāyu, the element of air. We term them "winds" in English because they move through the channels of body. Wind is moving air -- no movement, no wind.

Not only this but the Bodhicittavivarana mention the ālayavijñana and the three natures. AFAIK, it is unlikely that Sandhinirmocana was fully composed until the 3rd Century CE, the Lanka is definitely post-Nāgārjuna, and the Maitreya Chapter in the PP sutras was a later Yogacara interpolation. 

The author of the Bodhicitta Vivarana was the disciple of Saraha. In the Sakya version of sahaja-mahāmudra, this text and one of the dohas of Saraha (which one I forget) are critical commentaries. So from a Sakya POV, the Sahaja-Mahāmudra lineage of Saraha and NāgaArjuna is very connected with Guhyasamaja.

In Dzogchen, mind and matter exist because of avidya. When there is no more avidyā,for you there is niether mind nor matter. 

But to get back to the main point -- for example we talk about "subtle minds". What are subtle minds, what makes them subtle? The reduced frequency of spanda, pulsation, movement of the vāyu in the body. When the vāyu moves, concepts arise -- no movement, no concepts. No concepts, nothing really we can all mind at all. When the vāyu moves very little, then we call that "a subtle mind". Sutra for example, has no methods to reduce the movement of vāyu to such an extent that such "subtle minds" are accessed. In sutra methods, the movements of mind are always coarse -- apart from that fact that as a bodhisattva moves through the paths and stages the physical body they appropriate becomes ever more refined and thus the movement of vāyu becomes ever more subtle and unobstructed, especially after the eighth bhumi. But this is a very external approach, taking a long time.

One, this Nāgārjuna is not the Nāgārjuna that wrote the collection of reasonings. According to tradition, the Bodhicittavivarana is a commentary on the Guhyasamaja. This text is quite late. Likely by the same Nāgārjuna that wrote the Pañcakrama. 

The view here is Yogachara Madhyamaka, similar to Shantarakshita. 

"Pure consciousness" is not a good rendering for sems tsam po (cittamatra) -- i.e. mere mind. 

The normative Madhyamaka view re: consciousness would be that a consciousness arises conventionally only if there is an object and an organ meeting. Hence, conventionally speaking, normative Madhyamaka allows for the existence of external phenomena. 

So does Dzogchen. 

Citta-matra is a method, not a view, in this respect. The view is still madhyamaka.

Maybe your yogis don't. 

Anyway, your argument is a little mismatched to what I am talking about. I am not talking about ultimate truth.I am talking about the mechanisms described in Vajrayāna in general for how rebirth actually takes place. That requires, on a conventional level, that mind and matter must be inseparable. Cartesian dualism will not work in this instance. 

You are reducing all of this to a sūtrayāna tenet system e.g. yogachara. 

I don't happen to think Yogachara is very useful for understanding Dzogchen. That is my opinion.

The Madhyamaka approach is the accept whatever people accept as conventionally real without analysis, and to disabuse them of notions that contradict either dependent origination or emptiness (i.e. first causes and natures).

Of course, once the conventional is analyzed it is a different story.

You have not been looking for it, this is why. 

For example, the Samdhinirmocana sutra discusses conventions (vyavahāraḥ) extensively. Consult the Powers translation, Wisdom of the Buddha, and look up "conventions"in the index and you will find several discussions about what a convention is and how it is related to the three natures of yogacara, etc. This is apropo:

"Gunākara, if it is asked what the imputed characteristic of phenomena might be, [it is that] which is defined as a name or a symbol for the nature or feature of phenomena in order subsequently bestow a convention."

(see pg. 81 for Powers' rendering)

It completely resolves the problem. Matter is intelligent. If it was not, then we would be inert corpses. Assuming that mind and matter are somehow uniquely different in an absolute substantial sense is Cartesian Dualism. In fact, you can either say matter is the gross manifestation of consciousness or that consciousness is the most subtle manifestation of matter, it does not really matter. The sadadhātu has one cause — avidyā. When that cause, avidyā is removed, all six sadadhātus vanish. In the meantime, consciousness is not separable from the pañcamahābhutani. This nature of consciousness argument engaged in by Chalmers, and the physicalists is pretty boring. There is no split between mind and matter -- thinking there is one is a double delusion.

Bon is very similar to Tibetan Buddhism, in many respects, identical i.e. they have equivalents to Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna, Vinaya. They have bodhicitta, creation stage, completion stage, three kāyas, etc. 

They assert however the origin of their teachings are 18,000 years old, with the personage of one Tonpa Shenrab, as he is known in Tibetan. They look for their cultural origin not to ancient Tibetan culture -- which originated more or less in Kongpo and moved west into the Yarlung valley, but rather than ancient culture around Kailash known as Zhang Zhung Kingdom which dominated central Tibet, Western Tibet and surrounding regions for many centuries until 7th century C.E.

You can read a book called "Nine Ways of Bon" for an account of Bon teachings by Snellgrove. You can also check several of Samten Karmey's articles and so on. 

You also might check out Drung, De'u and Bon by Professor Namkhai Norbu which presents an alternate view of Bon history and its relationship to Tibetan culture.

Consciousness and matter are inseparable. 

You are merely restating the lower Buddhist position regarding substance dualism ala Descarte.

From a tantric perspective, for example, thoughts (citta) are movements of vāyu in the channels of the body.

Vāyu is the material element of air (part of the rūpaskandha). Specifically, the mind and the prana vāyu are merged and inseparable. 

The Mind/body problem is one that plagues rebirth explanations because Sutrayāna Buddhists are unable to give an account of the medium through which a mind passes from one body to the next. Vajrayāna in general solves that problem through vāyu. Such an account simply does not exist in sutra. 

In sutrayāna mind and matter are different substances.

It is indeed Nāgārajuna's position, the name of the dharma in question is avipraṇāśa. MMK 17:13-20 explicates this doctrine. Candrakriti clarifies. This is not an invention of Tsongkhapa's. Nāgārjuna affirms in verse 17:20 "The avipraṇāśa of karma is the teaching of the Buddha."

This is the sole place in the MMK where Nāgārjuna actually advances a shravaka position he likes. See Mabja, ppg. 353-359. 

As I said, this is originally a Sammitya doctrine. See also Karmasiddhiprakarana, ppg, 87-91 for a translation of Candrakirti's take. 

Nevertheless, even though among various shravaka theories that Nagarjuna examines, this is one he apparently likes, still, from a Madhyamaka perspective he finds the idea of this avipraṇāśa unnecessary even though it is a teaching of the Buddha.

Samkhya predates Buddhism. 
Vedanta predates Buddhism since the Brihadaryanaka and the Candoga predate the Buddha by three hundred years. 
Nyaya predates Buddhism. 
Vedic ritualism (Mimamsa) predates Buddhism
Yoga predates Buddhism. 

Only Vaisheshika can be plausibly dated after Buddhism. 

Now, Puranic religion obviously comes after Buddhism i.e. NIkāya Buddhism, but the elements that informed Puranic religion were already in play. Puranic Hinduism is just a little older than Mahāyāna. 

Advaita is a later development. 

The formal arrangement of the six darshanas, granted is quite late. It arose at the same time as the four tenet system in Mahāyāna Buddhism.

Most of the hierarchy in Buddhism comes from Asian cultural forms. It can be dispensed with in the modern world. 

Of course, we need to respect people and their choices -- so if someone is keen on a super-hierarchical school like Shambhala International, we should respect their choice. Of course if I am going to see some traditional Asian teacher, I will do prostrations out of respect. When you have respect, you can't have pride. Respect is the real prostration. When ever you respect someone, then you are prostrating to them.

Depends on what sang. The real purpose of sang is to purify. That is what the word "bsangs" actually means -- to cleanse. In this case we are cleansing with smoke. 

Many sangs are quite specific, restricted to one location, one local guardian and so on. General sangs offerings, like Riwo Sangcho, are purification rites focused on the four guests. 

The original sang offering left by Padmsambhava in Tibet i.e. Kama tradition, is the famous Nol sangs i.e. "purifying pollution". Lamas frequently combine this with Riwo Sangcho for a more full effect.

Of course it does. But I am not going to discuss that here more than to say this kind of anatomy is wrapped in metaphor. When one has studied Tibetan medicine, many things become obvious that seem mysterious and mystical in Dzogchen. 

Here is a hint "white silk thread" is common Tibetan medical term for nerve fibers in the body, for example, that run from the brain to all the internal organs, etc. 

But in reality, it is all about physical structures in the body and how to manipulate them.

Indeed, this is in fact what Neo-liberalism is. 

Franklin D. Roosevelt in an April 29, 1938 message to Congress warned that the growth of private power could lead to fascism:
"The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism—ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power"

And whose experience? An ordinary deluded persons experience? Is the direct perception of ordinary persons to be trusted? Knowing that you possess the three afflictions, how certain are you that your direct perceptions are to be trusted, since you never experience them directly. All direct perceptions are non-conceptual, uninterpreted; all so called "experience" is conceptual, interpreted. In order for a direct perception to be experienced there must be a reflexive awareness capable of recognizing that direct perception and framing it as an experience, for example, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral and so on. Why? Because direct perceptions are not self-reflexive. They are not aware that they are cognitions. We can know this because we have direct perceptions of many things in our visual field, for example, which we do not notice. We either process them out or cannot recognize them. Thus they are not part of our "experience". Experience is conceptual. And for ordinary persons, afflicted. So I would hesitate before declaring that the Buddha claims experience is decisive. Decisive for whom is the question. Experience is certainly not decisive for ordinary persons. If it were, than there would be no need for a path.

This sutta is shared by all canons of early buddhists.

You misunderstood -- all Buddhist schools accept three pramanas. They may disagree about what texts can be considered Buddhavacana, but they all accept sutras as authorities.

There are certain Buddhists, who recognizing that non-Buddhists will not accept vacana as authorities try to the prove the buddha is authority through direct perception and inference so that they will accept vacana as an authority. These scholars themselves accept vacana as an authority. 

The third category are the non-Buddhist lokayatis, materialists. Materialist views have begun to make inroads into Buddhism; for example insisting that direct perception along is valid. You seem to follow the latter line of thinking.

Gentle persons:

Diagnosis and treatment of spirit possession or attacks are actually an integral part of Tibetan Medicine. According to both Tibetan Medicine there are four main causes of disease: diet, behavior, season and spirits. 

While I understand your wish to help and mantra healing is an important part of treating such diseases -- such diseases need to be diagnosed properly. Not just any mantra will necessarily work. 

I can understand that some people wish to take psychological perspective about spirits, but this is not the view of Tibetan Medicine or Tibetan Buddhism in general. Giving people advice from Chö teachings is not really suitable and possibly dangerous since it can cause people to ignore dangerous symptoms.

At this point, even so, you still have to follow the laws of the nation you live in. You may disagree with a given policy of one's nation, for example, but the only time it would be permissible to completely break with one's civil government is if they were so tyrannical they were not even providing any services to the people at large. 

Now, for example, take the US Government, since that is who you are really talking about: tax revenues for 2010 were 2.16 trillion dollars. the federal deficit was 1.3 trillion dollars. Military spending is roughly eight hundred billion dollars a year. 

This means basically that US government is not spending tax dollars to prosecute its wars around the world, it is borrowing money to prosecute its wars around the world.

This means that still people should pay their taxes and at the same time work to have a functional government that refuses to engage in the type of military adventurism we have seen since the Bush Administration. 

It is simple numbers. Since the US Goverment still provides essential services, is not a complete tyranny (yet, though it seems with each year we keep sliding ever closer to fascism, no matter who is power, Repulican or Democrat, but this is largely because of the corporatocracy), US Citizens still need to pay their taxes as mandated in federal law from a Buddhist point of view. I am sure that Buddha would not have recommended that the subjects of Ajatasatru refuse to pay their taxes, for example.

You can try applying ghee or sesame oil inside of your nostrils before you go outside, create a barrier in this way. 

Avoid dairy, and get an oil called "anutailam" from Trihealth or otherwise, nasya oil from Banyan Botanicals. Use a neti pot, then nourish the membranes with the oil. It is important to use the oil after cleansing with neti, because otherwise, you will inflame and dry out the membranes. 

A lot of allergies are actually a side effect of weak metabolic heat. So, check with an local experienced Ayurvedic practitioner -- they generally have more experience with allergies than Tibetan doctors at present.

It is because buddhahood of lower yānas is incomplete and does not reach the stage of ka dag chen po, great original purity. The simplest way to explain it is that after the this universe dissolves and the next one arises, those beings who have not achieved the stage of ka dag chen po start all over.

You gave to understand that there is a passage in the rigpa rangshar which delineates these paths and stages, but they are not the real paths and stages according to the vehicles of cause and result. They are just names for progress in the four visions. So for example, when has knowledge of rigpa initially, this is called "Pramudita". But this does not mean that person has realized emptiness (that does not occur until the third vision). So these paths and stages named in Dzogchen just serve as metaphors. Thus Zhabkar states:

"Though these stages are individually divided  out of the apparent aspect
of the single stage (upon which there is no progress or training)
of the luminosity of the fundamental vidyā;
in reality, the stage of vidyā is single
but there is no need for specific training on causal stages
for obtaining the stage of Buddha Mahāvajradhara.
The manner of obtaining each stage through the stages
of the cause and result of the common vehicles,
likewise the stage obtained through the effort and practice
of creation and completion according to outer and inner secret mantra,
here do not exist as [stages] upon which to train or make progress.

In reality, all vehicles are included, and the paths and stages are complete
within the single stage of one’s pure vidyā."

So you can disagree with Zhabkar, etc. if you like.

There are two ways these things are explained, the common way, which accords with lower vehicles, in which the basis and the result are more or less the same. 

Then there is the uncommon way Dzogchen explains these things, in which the basis and the result are different from that of the lower vehicles. 

For example, in general, the nine yānas approach is to assert that all-basis is dharmakāya. In the special Dzogchen view, asserting that dharmakāya is the ālaya is a "Buddhist deviation". In Dzogchen, the ālaya is, as stated in the Mind Tantra of Vajrasattva:

The all-basis is the bardo of everything,
unconsciousness, unclear, and inexpressible.

The example for the ālaya is space. The example for the dharmakāya is celestial bodies. 

So you see, it is really not so simple as proclaiming that the basis and the result are the same for all schools, only the result differs. 

For example, the Samputa maintains there is a distinct different in omniscience between an eleventh and twelfth stage buddha, and a thirteenth stage Buddha. Related to this, Dzogchen refers to the 13-16 bhumis as those that "dwell in wisdom". Why? Because only 13th stage Vajradhara's on up understand that all appearances are the display of their own wisdom. 

Most people think that Buddhahood is irrersible; Dzogchen on the other hand asserts that the buddhahood of the lower yanas is reverts into the basis, and only Dzogchen results in complete and irreversible buddhahood. 

These are the kinds of things you discover when you read Vima Nyingthig, Khandro Nyingthig, Gongpa Zangthal, the Seventeen tantras and so on. 

The later in Tibetan history you go, the more homogenized the presentation of the four schools becomes. When you exam the texts of the Pre-Sarma period, then you find Dzogchen is really very different from what was introduced from India during the time of Rinchen Zangpo onwards. 

Dzogchen did not spread widely in India, neither did anuyoga. The main tantric teaching of India was Yoga Tantra/Mahayoga. 

Many masters to not present whole picture of Dzogchen. HHDL's agenda, which I respect, is to bring harmony to all schools. 

My interest is a little different -- I am interested in what makes Dzogchen so unique and so powerful. I know the difference between what is commonly stated as a nice political thing so Sakyas, Gelugpas and Sarma-oriented Kagyus  don't feel bad, and what the real teachings of Dzogchen say, but are not so publicized. I don't owe allegiance to any school. My interest these days in particular is solely anuyoga and Dzogchen teachings. 

That being said, don't think that I consider Lamdre, etc., as lacking depth, efficacy, or profundity -- they are profound, interesting, and wonderful teachings. I just think Dzogchen is more profound, more efficacious, and deeper. This is just my opinion.

well, for example, the "The Essence of the Critical Point of Memory" in the Vima Nyinthig, has a footnote on this passage "Though one seeks vidyā with words, the meaning is not touched..." that says "Through the assertions of the nine yānas". 

For example, in a teaching of Shri Singha to Vairocana found in the dgongs pa zang thal, the three inner tantras are listed as follows: mahāyoga, anuyoga and the view of the mahāmudra of non-dual appearance and emptiness. Following this, Dzogchen is listed separately from the nine yanas. 

Or there is a tantra called The Self-Arisen Great Perfection from the Kadag Rangjung Rangshar which states:

I demonstrated the definitive meaning, the self-originated primordial wisdom
for those of the best fortune. 
I demonstrated the Dharmas of the nine vehicles
for those of medium fortune.
I demonstrated the outer Dharma of the provisional meaning
for those with average fortune. 

And there is an interesting text in the Gongpa Zangthal called The Mind Tantra of Vajrasattva which extensively differentiates the great perfection from the nine yanas. It begins:

In the demonstration of the eight intimate instructions that are superior to the nine yānas, the intention of all teachings of the great perfection...

Because the view of nyingma mahayoga is dzogchen. In other words, HYT is more or less dependent on Madhyamaka for its view. Mahayoga takes its view from Dzogchen, specifically the Dzogchen as presented in the Guhyagarbha tantra, exemplified in the rosary of views intimate instruction. The main difference between mahayoga in this respect, however, and Anuyoga, is that Mahayoga takes the Dzogchen to be the result (more like mahamudra as conceived in Sakya) as presented in the sems sde system. Anuyoga takes Dzogchen as the basis. 

Still we have to distinguish that while ground mahāmudra of the Kagyu school and sems sde bear some similarities, they also end in Sems sde. It is the opinion of ChNN that the four yogas of mahāmudra were borrowed from sems sde by Gampopa, and certainly he was a Nyingma practitioner before he met Milarepa.

Hi Magnus:

The point is that inner tantras, nyingma mahayoga and anuyoga, have Dzogchen as their aim. But this does not mean that Dzogchen itself does not find these inner tantra approaches wanting in all respects. For example, there is the famous citation from Kunbyed Gyalpo. 

Of course a practitioner of Dzogchen can practice whatever he or she likes or needs. But at base, Dzogchen practice is not involved with the two stages. The other day ChNN stated that even Anuyoga is not really predicated on the two stages.

The basis for one system is not always the the basis for another system. For example, the basis in Dzogchen teachings is not the mind. 

Dzogchen distinguishes various kinds of basis depending on whether we are talking about sems sde, klong sde or man ngag sde. 

So in Dzogchen man ngag sde the basis is vidyā (rig pa), and not mind. Mind is an adventitious obscuration to be given up. As Longchenpa states in the Lama Yangthig:

"The essence of mind is the all-basis and the group of eight. The essence of vidyā is beyond the all-basis and the group of eight."

So you cannot be hasty and just lump everything together in a sort of a putanesca sauce of teachings. 

Dzogchen is not easy. It is very subtle, and so hard to understand.

The Gelugpas don't. The Sakyas explicitly do. In fact, they do so to the point that you might consider a little extreme. Gorampa's perspective is that the pointing out in the third and fourth empowerments makes one's post-meditation view irrelevant, whether Cittamatra or Madhyamaka, since the experience of pointing out and the sadhana method ensure correct view while practicing. 

What the Sakyas do not accept that is the idea that someone who has not received the four empowerments is a suitable candidate for pointing out.

Title: Re: Yidam and Dzogchen
Content:
I am searching for citation. The citation I have in mind is one where he refers to Hevajra as an outer tantra. 

 I agree that in shing rta chen po, grub mtha' mdzod, he gives the division set forth by Rangjung Dorje of:

maha = father
anu = mother
non-dual = ati.

But it does not really follow if you analyze well even Nyingma mahayoga. 

And yes, he also covers sarma and snying ma seperately -- however he does not present father, mother and non-dual tantra as equivalents with maha, anu and ati in the sarma section. He only presents this scheme in the rnyingma section of grub mtha' mdzod. You can check, sarma inner tantra section starts on 1095; nyingma inner tantra starts on 1110. He gives a citation from the seng ge rtsal rdzogs:

"Creation mahāyoga is like the basis of dharmas,
Agama anu yoga is like the path of dharmas, 
perfected atiyoga is like the result of dharmas."

But moreover, most of the tantras we normally consider mahayoga tantras, such as the eight pronouncements, Yamantaka, Hayagriva, Yangdag, etc. are listed by Longchenpa as anuyoga tantras -- normally people are accustomed to thinking of these deities as Mahāyoga cycles. 

Another feature that Longchenpa mentions is that creation is present in Anuyoga, but deemphasized. This is not the case with mother tantra in HYT. He mentions none of the root tantras one might expect for Mahāyoga, namely Guhyagarbha, etc. 

And of course he states that in Dzogchen, there is no creation stage whatsoever, pg. 1121:

"The essence of the dhātu of luminous natural great perfection is self-originated wisdom. Here, since there no cause and result of an object to create or an agent creating along with conditions, it has always existed [ye nas yod pa] as nature like space."

Moreover, we cannot consider this similar in anyway to the non-dual tantras of Hevajra because on page 1122 Longchenpa explicitly rejects that in Dzogchen there is any cause and result or that the basis can made into a path:

"Since there is no cause and result in the essence [ngo bo, svarūpa), it cannot be determined to be samsara or nirvana at all. Since whatever arises is made into a basis, that which is the wide open space of the dhātu and wisdom, or the source or foundation of all phenomena, is the basis. The lower vehicles that engage in effort, practice, accepting, rejecting deviate through dualities and are obscured. Further, if is claimed that "...since the basis is made into a path, it is a path"; since the basis is uncontrived and unaltered, it cannot be made into a mere thing, the basis cannot be made into a path, thus a basis and a path are in contradiction..."

In Vajrayana in general, the basis, which consists of the five aggregates, five sense objects, and so on are made into the path. In Dzogchen, the basis i.e.the uncontrived nature of the mind that is like space, to paraphrase Longchenpa, does not need fabrication or alteration -- creation and completion conceived in the HYT system are precisely alterations. So one can never say that non-dual tantra in sarma schools are equivalent with Dzogchen. 

In general, such formulas lead to more confusion than clarity since they are badly misunderstood, in my opinion.

It's the sort of statment that does not stand up to analysis very well. The reason it is repeated so often is that it is a sort of political statement made first by the third Karmapa. 

one: mahayoga has two stages
two: anuyoga is does not really have two stages
three: there is no explanation of the basis that corresponds with Dzogchen teachings in Anuttarayoga tantra. But this explanation does exist in Anuyoga. 

For example, I practiced Hevajra for many years. This is considered one of the two "non-dual tantra", the other is Kalacakra. 

I can assure you, there is no atiyoga in the Hevajra systems extant in the world today (who knows what is in the Hevajra in 500,000 lines). Hevajra is based completely on the two stages. Of course there are some statements in the Hevajra which resemble statements in Sem sde. Certainly Hevajra is the basis of the idea of sahaja, certainly the final goal of Hevajra is mahāmudra, and there is no doubt that Hevajra is profound. But, I have some expertise in this tantra, I also know Dzogchen pretty well. Saying that the non-dual tantras equal atiyoga is really a stretch; there is no anuyoga in it, let along atiyoga. But it is a nice politic thing to say which makes people in the new translation schools feel better. 

Mipham seemed to feel that the wisdom chapter of the Kalacakra was equivalent to thogal. But Dudjom Rinpoche rejects this idea.

Hi Magnus:

I think you are referring the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma rgyud. This tantras has a fully articulated preliminaries etc., up to thogal, and is mentions  Hayagriva/Vajrayogini for the deity. It is the root tantra for which the Khandro Nyinthig is the main commentary. 

I have seen mention of Vajravarahi pratice in the commentary of sgra thal gyur attributed to Vimalamitra, but there is no deity yoga practice per se, as far as I am aware, in any of the standard seventeen tantras. 

As for the Vima Nyinthig, again there is no explicitly mentioned deity practice that I have noticed, but I have not read all of it. Of course, one might consider the three roots in Lama Yangthig as connected. 

Generally however, the deity retreats in these systems never amount to more than 7 days to 21 days.

Right, and you understand that a lot of what Longchenpa wrote was defensive, meant to prevent criticisms of Dzogchen from those who adhered to the gradual path? 

I would be quite hesitant to make proclamations about what the Dzogchen tantras say and do not say if you have not read them in a comprehensive way. I don't mean this is a mean way, or to suggest you are stupid -- I am not mean, and you are not stupid. But the real teaching of Garab Dorje is surprising in many ways. Not least of which is pretty constant refrain that the real meaning of Dzogchen cannot be approached through the nine yanas. 

I don't want to get into providing voluminous citations -- because I think this is abusing the teaching, turning it into a book dance.

Actually, you have to understand one thing about Togden Rinpoche, when he was young, he suffered from mental illness. As I understand it, a lot of his practice was oriented towards removing the causes of his underlying health problems, chö, yantra, prostrations, etc. This is the reason, for example, that his main Yidam practice was Takhyung Barwa. We practiced this in the community for many years until Norbu Rinpoche switched to Guru Dragphur.

Once you have knowledge of your state (rigpa), and it is concrete, you have no more doubt, then you proceed in the confidence of liberation. That does not mean you are liberated, just you are certain that for you it will happen, based on your knowledge, your rigpa. 

So, I guess I agree more with Sonam. 

However, until you have firm knowledge (rigpa) of your state free from doubts, then you need to use various methods to reinforce that knowledge (rigpa).

No such thing as a failed introduction. The introduction is based on your experience. You will always have an experience in introduction even if it passes you by so quickly you cannot recognize it. This is why you work with this first. 

Maybe you need some secondary practice, like two stages, tsalung, etc., or you have a problem an obstacle you need to remove.

However, you will not understand this very well talking to me or anyone else on the internet. This is not something that can be understood intellectual sans experience. It is like trying to explain to someone who has never encountered a lemon what a lemon tastes like. Even if you tell them it is sour, their "sour lemon" is just an intellectual concept. 

What you need to do is go to a dzogchen master and do what they ask you to do. There are many styles of dzogchen masters out there. Some are not as "Dzogchen" as others even though they use the name "Dzogchen" to sell teachings.

What it means is that the methods of Dzogchen are completely different than the methods of the two stages. 

The two stages are always involved with trying to discover something with the mind, peeling away the layers of one's body, speech and mind trying to reveal its most subtle nature. 

With Dzogchen practice, you are working with that knowledge, the goal of the two stages, right from the beginning. This is why Dzogchen is referred to as the vehicle beyond cause and result. 

Likewise, in sutra, you are always practicing and trying to discover emptiness. But in Vajrayāna, you work with that knowledge of emptiness right from the very beginning. Emptiness is the result, from the sutra point of view, so in Vajrayana one works with the principle of the result of sutra right from the beginning.

Usually, people who do three years retreat will start with Vajrapani or Vajrakilaya; Hevajra creation and completion in the middle; some end with Mahakala, others with Yogini. It depends. Three retreat is a new addition to Sakya, actually. 

There is not that much difference between the two systems, in reality. The basic difference is that the Tsogshad is more scholastic. The Lobshad is based on some manuals written by Tsarchen's disciple, and is a bit more experiential.

Lam 'bras, the path together with the result is the main teaching of the Sakya school. 

The core of it is a concise set of instructions termed "vajra verses" written by the Mahasiddha Virupa for his disciple Krishnapa and brought to Tibet by Gayadhara, bestowed upon Drogmi Lotsawa. 

The main practices of Lamdre center on the creation and completion stages of the Yidam Hevajra. Nevertheless, it is a gradual instruction, containing the entire Mahāyāna path of sutra and tantra. 

One of the best features of lamdre is that is has a very detailed description of the precise experiences of traversing the paths and stages through the yogas of the completion stage.

Yes, that is exactly how it can happen. Recently, in Australia, CHNN explicitly stated this to be the case. 

This is why in Dzogchen there are many methods to work with -- different than sadhanas and deity yoga to be sure, but the principle is the same. 

The terms of the two stages, you receive an empowerment: but if you do not attain awakening during the empowerment, then you have methods to reach that state. 

Likewise, in Dzogchen, you have three transmissions: oral, symbolic and direct aka realization. If you do not experience realization on the basis of the oral and symbolic transmission right away, then there are many methods one can use to discover this state of realization.

This is the great controversy about Yogacara. Asanga maintains that in order for there to be an appearance of deluded perception, even though the appearances do not exist, there must be an existent basis for those false appearances -- for example, even though there is no real existent image on the screen, there is nevertheless a projector through which a film is running. When the film is done, so are the images. Likewise, when the traces are finished, so is the false projections. 

The real controversy is how far to extend that "existence" i.e. is the projector more real or less real than the projected images. 

According to the way Yogacara is presented in orthodox tenet systems (Which all are based on Bhavaviveka II's Tarkajvala), this basis is the ālayavijñāna. When the seeds are removed, the ālaya is held to transform into wisdom. I.e. this existent wisdom which is ultimate, has to be predicated on an existing consciousness in order to account for the transformation of consciousness to wisdom. 

In other words, conventional truth, in this way of presenting Yogacara, is the imputed projections. They all function, work quite well, until the basis of their reality is questioned. The ālaya projecting this is also understood to be relative. But when the traces are removed, the ālaya transforms into wisdom, and thus becomes ultimate. 

Then there is the gzhan stong way of understanding this. According to the their presentation, both alāya and the projected images are conventional. Wisdom is ultimate and merely covered over by the conventional. 

Then again, among gzhan stong pas, there are different ways of understanding the ultimate -- some seem to hold that it really exists. Others seem to hold it too is merely a yogic convention which when in equipoise is not needed and so on.

Title: Re: What is a tantric teaching in Buddhism?
Content:
The Vinaya Vastu is a complicated text. We cannot assume that its entire contents date from the time of the Buddha. 

I prefer to interpret these instances differently. I think that there is an underlyingPan- Indian culture, based on vedic ritualism, cosmology and medical ideas, that people mistakenly term "tantrism". Buddhists were first and foremost Indian, and they utilized their culture in their practice of Buddhism. Proof of this for example may be found in the Mahaparinibbana sutta where Buddha informs Ananda that "the faithful brahmins" will take care of his cremation and so on, because they know the proper rituals for interring a Cakravartin. Or, in the beginning of the same sutta, he informs a minister of Ajasatru that it will be hard to invade the Koasalians, because among other things, they have maintained their traditional shrines and modes of worship. 

All of this is not what we in Vajrayāna understand "tantra" to be. Of course we recognize that there are great similarities between non-Buddhist practice such as Shaivaite use of ganacakras, certain types of yoga, channels and cakras; secular practices such as royal coronation and so on. But just as the elements of Caitya or Stupa are all named after the ritual precinct of the Agnihotra, fire oblations, likewise, when these elements are taken up in the tantras they are repurposed if you will. 

You can see seeds of this or that development in later Vajrayana in early Buddhism -- for example, the cult of Dharmapalas is present from the very beginning in the Dighanikāya, but the way these things exist in a piecemeal fashion in early Buddhism means that they are not a path. 

Vajrayāna is a fully mature path, as opposed to the various miscellany found in various places. Also, even if Mahāmayuri is a deity in lower tantra, the practice of Mahāmayuri is also not a path. This deity is for temporary benefits, not for liberation. In lower tantra deities like Mañjuśri, Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapani are for complete realization. Lower tantra has hundreds of minor practices and mantras for various boons. Not many practices for complete realization. 

So we either have to redefine what "tantric" means, specify what we mean when we are using the term "tantric" in terms of Buddhism, or restrict the definition to Vajrayāna Buddhism from the 7th century to the present in its various manifestations in Esoteric Buddhism of China and Japan and Vajrayāna in Tibet.

So you have never experienced an empty bank account? An empty larder? Because certainly in this instant there is a correlate  with direct experience. The old "village is empty of a city, city is empty of a village" trope from the suttas i.e. the Cullasunnata sutta, major and minor. 

Phenomena are by necessary of free of duality, since they originate in dependence. That absence of duality also has a correlate in direct experience -- see Kaccaayanagotto Sutta i.e. "Everything exists,' this is one extreme [view]; 'nothing exists,' this is the other extreme. Avoiding both extremes the Tathaagata teaches a doctrine of the middle". 

The middle way view is by necessity a non-dual view, avoiding these extremes of dualism. That is also emptiness; emptiness cures the views of existence and non-existence -- that can be correlated in one's personal experience. 

Apatheia, on the other hand, vairāga, non-attachment, is not a particularly unique Buddhist principle.

There is one important point in this you are missing. The earliest known text in India we know of that is referred to as a "tantra" is the Agniveśa tantra -- which is the core of the important ayurvedic treatise, the Caraka Samhita. The composition of the CS is hard to date, but likely was compiled between roughly 200 BCE -- 200 CE. Before there were distinct Buddhist texts called tantras, was another ayurvedic treatise called the Aṣtaṅgahridayasamhita penned by a Buddhist physician named Vagbhata in roughly the fifth century CE -- this text refers to itself as a tantra in the colophon. 

Pathak's thesis is not that tantra existed in Buddhism from the beginning. His thesis is that elements existed in Buddhism from the beginning which are consistent with later developments called Vajrayāna. I don't disagree with this thesis. I think it is correct. 

However, Vajrayāna is a mature path. Reciting a mantra to remove snake venom is not a path.

The nice thing about śūnyatā is that you can stated that it is ultimate reality without committing oneself to an ontological position. Hence the tā suffix. 

Three gates of liberation are a little different: śūnya, alakṣana, apranidhana, empty, without characteristics, without aspiration. 

They are not states, they are entries. Emptiness is the bhutatā, the actual nature of the things. Also emptiness has no nature, since it is free from extremes. 

This is the beauty of Madhyamaka. You can assert emptiness as a nature, and no one can fault you. If you assert non-duality as a nature you have already committed an epistemological blunder.

If I had a position, I would be at fault.

Emptiness is one of three doors of liberation; non-duality is not. The other two being lack of aspiration and the signless. 

There is no philosophy of non-dualism in Buddhism. This is wholly the invention of western scholars. For example, Madhyamaka rarely uses the term "non-dual". 

When it is used in Yogacara, it is meant to describe lack of a real subject and object in perception (vijñaptimatra), and hence the absence of existence and non-existence in those imagined phenomena as well. 

It does not get used at all in the Nikaya schools. 

I think westerners are over-invested in this word.

But a word that is frequently brought up, over and over again, is anutpāda, non-origination, non-arising. This word is much more important for we Buddhists.

That emptiness is non-dual (i.e. free from extremes) is a fact. But it is not, for me, at any rate, a very important fact since it is just a bunch of words. Yes, of course as  Tibetan doctor, our view is Madhyamaka. My view is Madhyamaka. Not because I am attached to the middle way as a religion, but because this is just how things are. 

Therefore, I think "emptiness as non-duality" is pretty trivial. Like a rock, a stone. It is just there -- nothing worth getting excited about. Well, you could get excited about a rock or a stone, but not because it is empty. You get excited about it because it is useful for something. could help some sick person, could be tied to the end of rope and used as a anchor, etc. But its emptiness is not that exciting or that interesting. Neither is the emptiness of all phenomena in general. Now, the wisdom that intuits the emptiness of persons and phenomena and burns away afflictions, that is a little more exciting. But on its own, non-dual emptiness is trivial and totally uninteresting.

Yes, emptiness, the absence of the four extremes, is non-dual. But only trivially so.

You can try to receive the transmission for the short Shitro of Norbu Rinpoche. Then you can get the text. Learn the melodies, etc. It is very easy to do.

I am pointing out that there exists a little known criticism of non-dual equipoise i.e. one in which there is no perception of subject and object, in Dzogchen teachings, which, it is asserted can cause one to slip into nirodha-sampatti, and thence, into a annihilationist view.

Right, that is exactly what happened at e-sangha -- problems arose, we tried to deal with it with a policy. Eventually, it collapsed.

The initial problem came in this way -- people claiming to be monks (Zen priests) who were married, had kids, drank and held jobs, as well as some people posing as Lama "so and so" with no credentials. 

The majority of people at the E-sangha team, including but not limited too, the several bhikshus from three distinct monastic lineages (Theravada, Chinese and Tibetan) we had on staff at the time, thought that this idea of a monk or lama was not correct. 

We observed many beginners being very confused. So we tried to help by creating a protocol for properly identifying monastics as opposed to "alternate" ordinationsand lay teachers. but it didn't work in the end.

Right, there is a certain trend in Dzogchen tantras which regard these definitions as incomplete, and which warn that without supplementary understandings, a practitioners can err into cessation since the extreme of clarity is cessation.

It is based on personal experience. If you have it, then you have it. And if you don't, you don't. There is no point in arguing about it or speculating. 

There is a Dzogchen path that is not gradual, and is outside of the nine yānas, as hard as it may seem to be able to understand this.

According to the dzogchen tantras, a non-dual equipoise can easily lead to a deviation into a non-buddhist nihilistic view since there is a possibility of slipping into a meditative absorption of cessation.

Dependent origination is exactly the meaning of non-arising -- Manjushri states in PP sutras "Whatever arises dependently, just that does not arise in truth."


"Whoever sees the Dharma, sees dependent origination; whoever sees dependent origination, see the Dharma". etc. 

It is only through dependent origination that we can come to an unerring understanding of emptiness, etc.

From the point of the view of the spirit of the thing, perhaps -- but standards must be maintained. There are many people who are capable of upholding their vows -- so it is not impossible. Since there are such people, I think it is important their discipline be recognized and honored -- and it is not honored by allowing just anyone to call themselves or demand they themselves be treated as a fully ordained person just because they wish to have that status. People you are talking about won't care one way or another what they are called. But Bhikshus are the ambassadors of Shakyamuni Buddha. When his monastic sangha disappears, his dharma will be on the verge of collapsing.
