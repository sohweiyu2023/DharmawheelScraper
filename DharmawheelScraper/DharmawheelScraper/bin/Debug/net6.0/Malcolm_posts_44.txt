gZhan stong became popular in Karma Kagyu in the 18th century in eastern Tibet because Situ Panchen was  disciple of the abbot of Kathog, RIgzin Tsewang Norbu, who advised the former to adopt gzhan stong because it was more positive and therefore it would extend Situ Panchens' life. Because it was adopted by this powerful Karma Kagyu lama, gzhan tong was revived at Palpung near Dege, where Kongtrul studied. But of course this was not the gzhan stong of the Jonangpas, but was a rather modified version largely influenced by the Sakya master Serdog Panchen. 

gzhan stong is not a heresy per se. It is regarded by many people as a mistaken way of presenting the two truths of Madhyamaka via the three natures of Yogacara. 

Personally, I don't care what sutrayāna view people hold (Yogacara or Madhyamaka), because that is not the view with which Vajrayāna practitioners attain realization. The view Vajrayāna practitioners attain realization with is the experiential view inculcated during empowerment. It really does not matter much what one's intellectual predilections are (unless you are a Gelug, then it matters very much, as far as they are concerned) when it comes to Mahāyāna tenets (Yogacara or Madhyamaka) since they are somewhat irrelevant to the actual practice of Vajrayāna. 

The real point in all of this is that there are some people who follow gzhan stong views who reify jñāna as something which truly exists, and this deeply contradicts Dzogchen view, as indicated by the opening passages of the Unwritten Tantra states:

Hey, hey, apparent yet non existent retinue: listen well! There is no object to distinguish in me, the view of self-originated  pure consciousness; it did not exist before, it will not arise later, and also does not appear in anyway in the present. The path does not exist, action does not exist, traces do not exist, ignorance does not exist, thoughts do not exist, mind does not exist, wisdom does not exist, samsara does not exist, nirvana does not exist, vidyā itself does not even exist, totally not appearing in anyway.

But you really cannot understand this without studying and practicing under a real master.

1) It is not so simple to say that Dharmadhātustava is a 'gzhan stong' book, just like one cannot declare the Uttaratantra a "gzhan stong" book. For example:

Having abandoned concepts and investigation, 
the absence of the inherent existence of phenomena itself
is meditated as the dharmadhātu.

2) It is also not erroneous to state that the reality the Buddha describes in the sutra is the same reality presented in Dzogchen. 

3) Therefore, your attempt to prove that Dudjom R's presentation subsumes his understanding of Dzogchen under gzhan stong is not proven, far from it. 

What is at stake here is how that "natural reality" is to be experienced and realized. All approaches to the middle way in sutra, no matter whether you take Nāgārjuna or Maitryanatha's approach are analytical and intellectual, that is the problem with spros bral, gzhan stong, dge lug madhyamaka and so on —&nbsp;they are all analytical, philosophical approaches to reality. This is ultimately the difference between sutra and tantra, as the great translator Drogmi pointed, the view of sutra is intellectual, the view of mantra is experiential. Even if gzhan stong were the most refined, most detailed, highest, most sublime approach to sūtra, it would be still be intellectual and analytical and therefore quite coarse and inferior compared to the experiential view of mantra.

What you are conflating however is Dudjom R.'s sutrayāna views with his Vajrayāna views. As I pointed out to you, when it comes to the nine yānas, each yāna has it's own view. In the Bodhisattvayāna Madhyamaka is considered the highest view. Then of course we can disagree about what Madhyamaka means, but it is very plainly stated in all Dzogchen texts that the view of Dzogchen surpasses the views of the eight lower yanas. 

So while Dzogchen masters can argue about the various merits of this or that interpretation of Madhyamaka, in the end their view will be Dzogchen and not Madhyamaka, no matter whether they prefer gzhan stong Madhyamaka (Dudjom R, Kongtrul), Gelug Prasanga (Jigme Lingpa) or Pre-Gelug Prasanga (Longchenpa, etc.)  Gorampa (Khenpo Shenga, etc.) and the views of the eight lower yanas will always be subordinate to the view of Dzogchen in their eyes.

That is not what this passage means. It is not a reference to so called rang stong and gzhan stong. 

It is a reference to the fact that tathagātagarbha teachings (a vital part of Dzogchen), according to Longchenpa, are part of the so called third turning of the wheel (a turning so important that it garners virtually no comments at all from the Indian authors preserved in the bstan 'gyur). 

However, as I have pointed out, when the sole source (Samdhinirmocana sutra) for the notion of three turnings is actually examined, it is merely a restatement of the doctrine of the second turning in unequivocal terms. 

However, Longchenpa never explains the tathagatagarbha according to the gzhan stong system, and he clearly explains the three own natures as belong to cittamatra which he considers inferior to Madhyamaka. 

When he treats the issues of Madhyamaka and the tathāgatagarbha, he clearly states in the sgrub mtha' mdzod that Prasanga Madhyamaka is the definitive view of Mahāyāna and that the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras are the definitive sutras. 

Of course, Dudjom Rinpoche followed his own teachers in this respect, and he embraced the Karma Kagyu presentation of gzhan stong when it comes to the view of Madhyamaka.

What I am saying is that there are different interpretations of sutra level Madhyamaka. His preference is gzhan stong, just as Jigme Lingpa's was Tsongkhapa's view. However, in terms of their ultimate view, both Dudjom Rinpoche and Jigme Lingpa were Dzogchenpas. 

You are suffering from an idea promulgated amongst many non-Nyingmapas that there is no difference in view between sutra and tantra, and that the view of sutra that you have is the same view that you apply in tantra. But this is not true in the Nyingma school, where each of the nine yanas has its own view.

Substantial in this case means self held by non-Buddhists immediately preceding the passage you cite:


"...The self maintained by vulgar children is held to be the size of a thumb, the size a white mustard seed or the size of an atom. Since such a self was not mentioned by the Tathāgata, even though he explains that there is no self in phenomena, it is not that there is truly no self. The "self" is any dharma that is true, pure, permanently existing, independent, unchanging and undying, that is what is called "self", just as that great physician is skilled in using milk as medicine."

So, here the Buddha is not teaching a substantial self like the some other nonbuddhists do, as I said before. 

The other important point is that Buddha taught selflessness in order to tame nonbuddhists. If you run around saying that Buddha taught a self, then how will nonbuddhists be able to distinguish the self they taught from the suchness as the real nature of phenomena? This is why even still, despite what provisional texts like the Nirvana sutra say, the central teaching of the Buddha is selfless of persons and phenomena. 

People who run around saying that Buddha taught "enlightenment" as the "true self" really do a disservice to sentient beings who have not been cured of wrong views of the self. In fact the Buddha did not teach self or selflessness as a definitive teaching. 

The Nirvana sutra's use of the term "self" is a play on words, where the meaning of atman as a transmigrating self (rejected by the Buddha) is contra posed with the meaning of atman as "nature" (emptiness, suchness, etc.). If however, one suggests that the meaning of this is all the qualities of Buddhahood fully exist from the beginning with the continuums of sentient beings, rather than as an inherent potential, then your position is no different than non-buddhists who assert a substantial self. 

And anyway, we have already seen that the the Buddha defined self as jñāna, meaning the nature of consciousness itself.

There is a reason why sems sde is considered inferior to man ngag sde. 

Some Dzogchen tantras assert that the youthful vase body exist in the human body with tiny little eyes and so on. As I said, it is not easy to understand Dzogchen (not least of all because there are three main traditions, and each tradition has its own tantras and lineage, etc.)  and differentiate veiled rhetorical statements like the one cited here from the actual core of the teachings. Then of course, you have to ferret out why Longchenpa cites this text in his ngal gso skor gsum and so on.

Not %100, mainly because it is a somewhat incomplete explanation and lacks important nuances, such as the fact that all the appearances of Mt. Meru, houses, trees, etc., arise from ignorance, from NOT recognizing one's basis.

I did no such thing. Dudjom Rinpoche, like Jigme Lingpa (an adherent of Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Madhyamaka) before him, did not conflate his preferred interpretation of Madhyamaka with Dzogchen and there are very important reasons for this. 

Dudjom Rinpoche, like Jigme Lingpa, Longchenpa and so on before him, states very clearly that tenets like Madhyamaka and so on obscure the meaning of Atiyoga when he introduces the superiority of Atiyoga in the big red book.

As to the first point, there is a lung for the whole of the bka' 'gyur and the bstan 'gyur, even so, sūtras do not require a lung to be read. Tantras, on the other hand, generally do, or at least one has to have had a major empowerment otherwise you are not supposed to even look at them, much less things like vajras and bells. 

As to the second point, one cannot receive a lung from a recording. Why? Because mantras and so on cannot be transmitted this way. Believing that you can receive a lung from a recording is similar with believing that you can get light from a lamp without plugging it into a wall. There is no direct living connection with the source. This is why lungs and empowerments from recorded media are not valid means of transmission.

The key difference, of course, is that a recording is an inert pattern stored on a hard disk somewhere, and Chanchub Dorje was a fully realized person. The Buddhas see sentient beings as Buddhas, but we still need to do our own work and wake up to our own nature. The Buddhas cannot "give" us empowerments that we are not aware of. Empowerments are not given, they are received. That means active participation by two people at the same time. And as you know, ChNN himself has stated numerous that empowerments and introductions and even lungs cannot be received from recordings.

States the following:

Child of a good family, "buddhanature" is ultimate emptiness. Ultimate emptiness is "wisdom." In that respect, "empty" is not perceived to be either empty or not empty.  Through discerning wisdom [prajñā] all that is empty, not empty, permanent, impermanent, suffering, bliss, self and non-self is seen. "Empty" is  all samsara. "Not-empty" is parinirvana. Samsara is in the range of the selfless, "self" is parinirvana. To see everything as empty; but not see what is not empty is  not "the middle path." To not see everything as in the range of the selfless, but not see the self is not "the middle path". "The middle path" is buddhanature.

Of course, now we meed to understand what wisdom, jñāna, is according to this text. After giving a description of various samadhis, the Buddha then earlier in the text:

"Wisdom" is to be understood as the buddhanature that exists in all sentient beings". 

Further, when we consider the four categories of permanence, bliss, self and purity, the Buddha states:

For the worldly there is permanence, bliss, self and purity. Also for the transcendent there is permanence, bliss, self and purity. Worldly Dharmas are expressible, but meaningless. Transcendent Dharmas are expressible and also meaningful. 

If it is asked why that is so, since Worldly Dharmas possessing four distortions, the meaning cannot be realized. If it is asked how so? Their perception is distorted, their mind is distorted and their view is distorted, and because of these three distortions, the worldly see bliss as suffering, see the permanent as impermanent, see the self as not a self, and see the pure and impure, thus these are distortions. Because of distortions the worldly speak the words [permanence, bliss, self and purity] but do not understand the meaning. 

In that respect, if it is asked what the meaning is, the selfless is "samsara"; self is the "Tathāgata"; impermanent is the śravakas and pratyekabuddhas; permanent is the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata. Suffering is all tīrthikas; bliss is parinirvana; impurity is conditioned phenomena; purity is the pure dharmas of the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Therefore, this is undistorted. 

As we can see, we do not need to take the Buddha literally on the point of the self, because if we did, we would be left with the negative consequence that we should all have all the perfect qualities of buddhas and bodhisattvas present fully formed in our mind streams. Anyone can see this is not so. 

So Trungpa is perfectly in accord with the Buddha because the way some people these days present the teachings of the Buddha in the Nirvana sutra is quite distorted, presenting the teaching of the Nirvana Sutra in the manner of the worldly interpretation of permanence, bliss, self and purity and leading others astray.

Similar causes and conditions result in similar effects. If you see your real nature, the six realms are the six dhatus of Samantabhadra, if you don't, the six dhātus of Samantabhadra are the six realms. As Nāgārjuna states in the MMK:

Samsara is not a little bit different than nirvana, 
nirvana is not at little bit different than samsara;
whatever is the limit of nirvana, 
that is the limit of samsara.
A little difference between those two
does not even have the slightest existence.

The basis [primordial state] is a way of describing how we become buddhas by recognizing our real state or sentient beings by not recognizing that state, as well as describing how our real nature is whether we recognize it or not.

As described above, the term "ground of being" was coined by Tillich as a term for God. Hence it is not a proper term to be used in Buddhadharma at all.

Put another way, all fires are  similarly hot, but there is no "ground of fire" from which all fires arise.

It means that the emptiness of the mind is not fixed in the clarity of the mind. 

The whole passage concerns a definition the original basis, thog ma gzhi. 

If there is an mind for every sentient being, there is a basis for every sentient being.This is why they basis is defined as being beyond one or many. It is beyond being one, since there is a diversity of sentient beings; it is beyond being many, since the basis is generic, and exists the same way in each sentient being.

"Dharmin" means the subject of a reasoned discussion. A "defined instant" means an instant predicated on having arising, ceasing and abiding (and such instants are rejected even in Yogacara).

So it means here that the basis, ones own unfabricated mind, has no fixed form or nature and is essentially timeless since time is also not established.

This is a perfect definition. 

The problem with most of these conversations about the Dharma on the internet, is that we are looking at these teachings, especially a teaching like Dzogchen, through an incredibly narrow aperture, assuming that the one glint we see of the teachings represents the whole. 

We are also in a time where foreign teachers try to communicate with students using terms in English without an educated background in Western Philosophy, and Theology and so imply things they have no intention of implying.

As for the second point, no, the Gelugp's didn't change that. One still should never display the form of Caturmukha Mahākala. 

Samayas don't change just because the teachings are brought from one culture to another — for example, the samayas did not change their character because Tibetans imported Vajrayāna from India. Therefore, we should not expect them to be mutable just because we live in the West. 

Samayas are something taught in the tantras. Regardless of what others may do, I encourage people to follow them according to how they have been understood.

The transcendent sublime nature is the attainment of the transformation into the very wisdom that encompasses all of existence and peace, the nature of all phenomena. This transcends the extreme of provisional insubstantiality-differentiated from the substantial existence of self in terms of the mere non-existence of self-and in so doing, utterly quells all such conceptual complexities.

This great nature is the wisdom body of space-like equality, which exercises mastery over all phenomena. It is the transformed locus of the entire unfathomable and matchless ocean of undefiled qualities such as the ten powers and the ten masteries. It is the sublime basis for spontaneously accomplishing the two benefits.[/quote]

Samsara does not equal conditioned phenomena. Why? Because if it did, there could be no pure conditioned phenomena such as path dharmas. People frequently confuse these two things much to their detriment. In other words, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, but not all conditioned phenomena are impure.

Furthermore, indeed all conditioned phenomena are intrinsically pure, and it is just this intrinsic purity of the mind that sutras refer to as tathagātatagarbha. It is this purity which is the basis for all buddhaqualities. Translating "atma" as "self" in this context is a misfortunate error when in fact the term simply means "nature" in this context as numerous usages prove. Tagathāgarbha is indeed pure, permanent, blissful, and a nature, but it is not a thing per se., it it also not a "self" and using that term and applying too tathāgatagarbha is just confusing. Further, claiming it is source of impure conditioned phenomena is also a category error. On the other hand, rhetorically samsara can be "based" on tathāgatagarbha since the non-recognition of one's real state does result on wandering in samsara.

The "ground" of samsara is ignorance, not enlightenment. It may be the case that there is no suchness to discover outside of samsara, but in that case, this does not make suchness a "ground" per se out of which phenomena arise. The root and basis of samsara is just the non-recognition of how things are. But this does not mean that there is some unconditioned enlightened pleroma out of which the phenomena of samsara and nirvana are produced.

There is no difference between this view and the view of Advaita, which holds that Brahman, not ever non existent, uncreated, unconditioned, permanent, bliss, eternal, pure, True Self, etc. is the ground for phenomena. 

In reality created, conditioned, impermanent, non-eternal and so on phenomena cannot have an uncreated, unconditioned, permanent ground (because a series is impossible, etc., all the faults which belong to positing a permanent creator, etc.) Those Buddhists who hold such a view have erred into eternalism.

Buddhaqualities may be inherent in the dharmakāya, but only buddhas can see the dharmakāya, just as only buddhas can see tathagātagarbha. Thus one cannot evade the two accumulations, whether it takes three incalculable eons as in common Mahayāna, or on one lifetime, as in Secret Mantra.

By 1660 (the date of the above cited letter), the Fifth was firmly in control of Tibet. 

Sperling conflates two distinct epochs in the Fifth's life, disturbances in Tsang that also tally with disturbances caused by Dogyal, and the events of Tsang war in 1640. 

Moreover, Sperling does not state to whom he sent these instructions, but it is clear when the letter is read in full it was sent to Tsi'u dmar. Now of course it is too late, because this misinformation now shows up on many web sites.

In 1640, he was only 23 and fully controlled by the regent, Sonam Chophel, who waged war against the King of Tsang in the Fifth's name.

It is not such a letter. It is a letter of petition to Tsi'u dmar po to quell disturbances in Tsang.

It ends with:

"Please pacify all the negativities of this time such as the illness, wars and famines 
of Pur rgyal and Tibet, and increase happiness, 
fully increase the doctrine of scripture and realization, 
effortlessly accomplish the wishes of me, the Vidyādhara..."

He says:

Because of causes and conditions, an acacia thorn pierced the Tathāgata's foot. That too is the Tathāgata's skillful means, but is not the ripening of karma.

But it is not accurate and the term never once occurs in any tantras considered Yoga tantra on down; whereas the term guhyamantra occurs in all kinds of tantras down to the Susiddhikara, generally considered to be the root tantra of the kriya tantras. It even occurs in Vinaya texts, PP in 8000 lines, Avatamska, Ratnakuta collection, and so on.

You mean amongst all followers of the niruttaratantras? 

Yes, I think so. For example, commentary tantra of the Guhyasamaja, the Sandhivyākaraṇa states:

Bodhicitta becomes vāyu, 
its form exists in space, 
it is the life of all sentient beings,
it is the nature of the five with ten names,
renowned as the twelve links, 
its nature becomes three, 
the bodhicitta called “vāyu”
this is the chief of consciousness. 

Further, another commentary tantra, the Vajramālā, makes it very clear that even between the births, the all-basis consciousness is also inseparable with the mahāprāṇavāyu. 

In other words, Vajrayāna texts treat our consciousness in terms of its embodiment in a manner very distinct from lower tantra and sutra.

It means that in Vajrayāna, the key to awakening lies in human anatomy, not in philosophical speculation. It means that all the qualities of the basis, path and result are complete in the human body, and do not need to be gathered elsewhere. It means that, according to Vajrayāna, that the mind is a function of the body and its anatomy. It means that the classic dualism of namarūpa does not mean that nama and rūpa are inherently different, as philosopher's like Dharmakirti would have it, but rather than there is no state in mind is dissociated from matter. In this respect, Vajrayāna is monistic, though of course in practical discussion, the substance dualism of sūtra dominates even Vajrayāna discussion, obscuring this point for the most part. But when you read texts like the Khandro Nyinthig, or the rdo rje lus sbas bshad by Yanggongpa, it becomes clear that the dualistic approach to mind/body in sūtra and abhidharma is abandoned by Vajrayāna in so far as it explains all of samsara and nirvana are present in the body.

It is stating that arhats and so on mistake their realization for a final realization, but that nevertheless, their path is included in the "ekayāna". It is basically the same sentiment as in my signature. All Dharmas are included in the Dzogchen Teachings, but Dzogchen is the supreme teaching which surpasses them all.

You have to understand, the dharmakāya is the mind of the Buddha, that is nondual by definition. As it says in the Avatamska:

In this respect "spontaneous" means free from objects. We are not capable of that, not even a bodhisattva on the stages is capable of that, since they have a very subtle obscuration that causes them to have dualistic perception, albeit on a very subtle level.

Shitro is not necessarily a body mandala, for example, the Shitro practice connected with the Gongpa Zangthal cycle of teachings. Two mandalas are taught in Guhyagarbha, the peaceful mandala, which is very similar to Guhyasamaja, and a wrathful mandala. They can be practiced together or separately. In the Guhyagarbha major empowerment, they are granted on two separate days and are separate empowerments. In terma systems, they are generally granted on the same day.

I explained this to you —&nbsp;I know many, many of his direct students. He would often times use sexual situations as a teaching method, as well as alcohol. He even used LSD etc. 

Trungpa used any method he could to reach people who were hard to reach. He also used these to create situations so that people could go beyond their limitations, which after all is the job of a real teacher of Dzogchen and Mahamudra.

For example, sometimes he would randomly have his driver pull into a stranger's driveway, and have the student get out and knock on the door, he did many things like this all the time. He would burst into people's rooms in the middle of the night at his seminaries, and if you were sleeping alone, without a partner, he would demand to know why and then fix you up with someone. 

In any case, it hardly matters now what he did. He has passed on, and a teacher like him will not be seen again for a long while.

Content:
It's "eye of yoga" as the Tibetan bears out, and it is not the common title of the text, rgyud sde spyi rnam is the common title. The full title of course is rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa bzhugs so . 

The line in question says "rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa rnal 'byor mig", i.e. "The General Presentation of the Divisions of Tantra is the eye of yoga...", etc. 

So I have to disagree with your contention that "Eye of Yoga" is the title in that line, rather, it is a descriptive of what the text is supposed to do, i.e. provide an eye on yoga. 

Further, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen refers to this text simply by the name rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa in the the rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa dang rgyud kyi mngon par rtogs pa'i stong thun sa bcad. 

The Hevajra Tantra is not merely an Yogini Tantra, it is also a yogatantra, for this reason Loppon Rinpoche explains that Hevajra is non-dual tantra based on this passage from Vajrapañjara:

The Hevajra yogatantra
was explained by the Victor first.
Later the yoginītantra
similarly is for the conversion of women. 

Loppon Rinpoche adds:

True, it may be called “ḍākinītantra”. That does not contradict a nondual method and discriminating wisdom tantra because discriminating wisdom tantra is necessary in nondual tantra.

When Lowo Khenchen [rgyud sde spyi rnam gsal byed sogs, pg. 18], defines the reason for the name rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa, he states, "Loppon Sonam Tsemo's composition has four synonyms: 1) The tantra division 2) the general presentation 3) an introduction to all tantras 4) the eye of yoga."

However, that does not justify "the yogini's eye" as a title. In fact, the formal title given in the colophon is actually, The General Presentation of the Tantra Divisions, an Introduction to all
Tantras.

If you were to retitle the book, The Eye of Yoga would be a better choice, in my opinion.

It is complete nonsense. It cannot be defended in any way. The way most Tibetans etymologize "sangs rgyas" is that "sangs" means to cleanse or purify, additionally "sangs" also means to wake up; and rgyas means "to expand" or "fully". So it means to remove or cleanse afflictions and to expand wisdom, or more simply, "fully awaken".

Budh simply means to awaken; dha means that possessor of that, hence Buddha simply means "the one who has awakened".

Amazing, wielder of the vajra,

Likewise, son of a good family, because you have avoided entering a false path, I have summarized the views of a self and demonstrated them.

While the actual content of different non-buddhist vehicles is mistaken, one can understand that impulse to follow them is an impulse towards liberation from the same tantra:

[S]ince a person living in a nirmanakāya buddhafield of a buddha has set lamps he sees a Buddha from the five lights of wisdom through a slight clairvoyance and experiences five fires.

I never held that Buddha did not teach emptiness. He clearly did teach emptiness even if you only accept Hinayāna sutras as being valid.

Allow me to illustrate a point. For example, I studied Yoga and Samkhya with Ramaswami. If someone should ask me to teach a course on the Yoga Sutras, then I would. I would present its point of view to those students who were interested in it. 

When pressed, would I claim that I followed the version of liberation presented in that text? No, of course not, no more than Ramaswami, when pressed, admitted that he was an Advaitan, even though his guru, Krishnamācarya was a Vaiśnava in the Ramanuja tradition (Viśtādvaita). 

If I am teachings Ayurveda, I teach Samkhya; when teaching Tibetan Medicine, I teach Buddhadharma. I think that the latter us more profound than the former. But Samkhya has its uses, even if its ultimate view is a problem.

There were some things which I hold as deep convictions: dependent origination, emptiness, rebirth and karma. I also deeply hold the conviction that apart form the Buddha and his followers, liberation as understood and taught by the Buddha is not achievable outside of his path. You can examine my posts for the past 20 years, and you will see that I never vary from these points. People like to make a big deal out of some superficial "volte faces" I have shared with you all, but in reality the core of what I understand to be unique about Buddhadharma has not changed in 20 years and will not change since it arises out of my experience of the teachings, as an examination of my posts will show. 

The reason why I do not express doubt about whether there can be realization of the same ultimate truths by those who do not follow Buddhadharma is that if such people did have the same realization as the Buddha and his followers, they would teach exactly what Buddha and his followers taught, i.e. dependent origination, emptiness and so on. Since they don't teach Buddhadharma, I question the claim that they have realized what the Buddha realized. I don't think there has ever been anyone on this globe who has ever had realization superior to the Buddha's total perfect awakening, not in any Hindu sects, not in any Jain sects, much less traditional Chinese religion, Islam, Christianity, or Judaism.I do not think they even have partial realization.

Of course there is mundane wisdom in all of these non-Buddhist traditions, no one denies that. But when it comes right down to realizing the nature of reality, as the Rig pa rang shar points out:

As such, also the three hundred and sixty views
can be gathered into four categories. 
Further those can be included
in eternalism and annihilationism. 
Those also can be included in meaningless nihilism.
This is the extent of the worldly views. 

and:

Likewise, the countless views of a self are included in two. Those are included in both the eternalist view and annihilationist view. Countless views of self come from those two.

There is no awakening outside of Buddhadharma. The best we can hope for those following the yānas of devas and humans is a higher rebirth and eventual contact with the Buddhadharma. 

Does this mean we should stop teaching Yoga Sutras, etc.? No, of course not. But after a certain point it has to become clear to any practitioner where they have confidence and faith. If someone is really a Shaivaite, Vaishnava or even a follower of Franklin Jones, what need would they have to follow Buddhadharma? They've chosen their refuge. It is not our job to change that. But we should not, in a rush to ecumenicism, erase the distinction between Buddhadharma and Sanatanadharma. They do not point to the same reality, they do not have the same assumptions about karma, rebirth and liberation, and so on.

Well, provide your account of what liberation is in Hinduism as you understand it, and how it is attained. Then we will stack it up against what the Buddha taught and see how it measures up. 

One of the difficulties here of course is that even the Buddhist idea of what constitutes rebirth is complete different than the Hindu idea. Ideas about whether karma are also totally different. The notion of a self of course has to be addressed, since this concept is refuted in Buddhadharma (apart from those modern perverts who think that Buddha taught a self and what pertains to a self), and so on.

I am not speculating, I am reporting what it is stated in the authoritative texts of the Buddhist tradition. Now, you may not feel that these texts are authoritative, but for me they are and that is the end of it. 

When we talk about "insight" we are talking very specifically about the Buddha's experience of Vajropama samadhi and what he reports and teaches. This kind of non-conceptual samadhi, the samadhi of cessation merely creates causes for rebirth in this or that loka, like all mundane samadhis and dhyanas unless one has attained the path of seeing. 

Now in turn, unless you can assure us that in fact you are speaking from detailed knowledge of having experienced and realized both paths, how can your perspective be anything other than a speculation based on your own suppositions or someone else's opinion?

It is not the contemplations that are important, it is the view brought to contemplation that makes the difference.

Ajātivāda was borrowed from Mahdyamaka into Advaita by Gaudapada. 

But since it is not grounded in dependent origination, even Gaudapada's presentation misses the point. 

Anyway, as you and I have discussed before, I do not think that the various liberations bandied about by this and that school are even commensurate with one another. That is to say, I don't think non-Buddhists and so on are necessarily in the same mountain range as Buddhadharma, much less climbing the same mountain.

While Muslims are not ipso facto bad people (quite the contrary), it must be recognized that Buddhism and Islam can barely coexist on the same planet —&nbsp;not because of Buddhist intolerance, but because of the systematic Islamic intolerance of other religions, specially the Salafis. The Saudis have been exporting Salafism for years. 

Please keep in mind that Muslims wiped Persia clean of Zoroastrians within the space of 250 years, systematically forcing conversions and so on.

Threatening the Dharma threatens all sentient beings since the Dharma is the only source of refuge in samsara. Sponsoring wrathful pujas to counter the power of demonic human beings bent on destroying the Dharma is nothing but compassionate and benefits all sentient beings, including the demonic humans who are the object of such pujas. 

Ordinary aggressors simply do not warrant such rites since they are no threat to the Dharma.

It is not really possible to explore this in a simple post. However, the long and short of it is that the highest Buddhist tantric systems present the body in a way entirely different than lower Buddhist schools such as Theravada and general Mahāyāna, or even lower tantra. In lower schools, things like the three kāyas and so on are exteriorized, but in the highest tantric systems they are understood to be implicit in the very structure of the body itself. The way the body is understood in Hindu systems is really not the same, so no, I do not think one can say that aspects of yoga as understood by Hindus were adopted by Buddhists.

Dan, what is the topic of the thread? "Mixing Buddhist and non-Buddhist Practices", right? 

So, essentially, we are not talking about whether Jesus is an inspiring character for someone, our warm feelings about St,. Francis of Assisi and so on. 

We are talking about a technical issues, e.g, for example, whether one ought to sincerely attend a Catholic Mass, looking for redemption, as a Buddhist. In other words, we are discussing the appropriateness of someone who claims to follow Buddhadharma who also asserts that Jesus Christ is their lord and savior. 

Someone who has taken refuge in the Three Jewels cannot at the same time take Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. They may imagine that they can, but all they succeed in doing is ignorantly destroying their refuge in the Three Jewels. 

This is also the case with teachings such as emptiness and dependent origination. For example, I heard HH Dalai Lama, that bastion of ecumenicalism, state in 2005 in Tucson, AZ, that emptiness was not the business of Christians and that he generally felt that Christians ought to mind their own business. Emptiness, he said, was the business of followers of Buddhadharma, and that is was inappropriate for Christians to be interested in it. Why? Because Christians believe in ex nihilo creation, souls, and so on. Ex nihilo creation and dependent origination are mutually incompatible. One does not need to be a Buddhist to see this, as Lucretius said, ex nihilo nihil fit, "nothing comes from nothing" (but we leave all similarity with epicurean materialism here). 

It's a little different with Hinduism and Buddhadharma. There are many mundane rites Buddhists can avail themselves of from Hinduism, and have done so for millennia. Even so, it is inappropriate for those who have taken refuge in the Three Jewels to take refuge in Brahma, Shiva or Vishnu and so on because the latter are mundane gods who have not realized the nature of reality and are themselves trapped in samsara, like Jesus, Allah, Jehovah, etc.

We cannot allow our warm and fuzzy feelings obscure the fact that Buddhadharma is something very precise and specific. It is not a method of "becoming a better person", nor is it a method of "resolving our unresolved issues", nor is it a practice of "mindfulness", nor is it a method of "becoming more compassionate", and so on. All of these things reduce Buddhadharma to the level of pop self-help manuals. 

If someone from outside the Dharma wants to enter the Dharma he or she must leave their previous refuge behind. You cannot have two feet in two boats (try it, it is really, really difficult), you cannot serve two masters, etc.

"Are you sorted, free of neuroses, joyful, resourceful, disciplined, reliable, kind and forgiving, humble, hard-working and undemanding."

Yes, for the most part. Though like any ordinary person I have my strongly afflicted moments. 

Those "some people" are not followers of Buddhadharma. They follow other paths. 

I can say that other paths are not conducive to the "liberation" we practitioners of Buddhadharma hold to be liberation since this liberation is very clearly defined by the Buddha. Liberation or freedom means being free from afflictive emotions which cause rebirth in samsara. That freedom cannot arise through other paths which encourage a view of soul or a self, or through philosophies which negate the truth of rebirth and karma. 

It is true that people have their karmic propensities and are more attracted to this or that religion —&nbsp;it is not our job to interfere with their lives; but the sorrow of samsara is that sentient beings are confused about what will bring them ultimate happiness. 

I would suggest strongly that anyone who feels that liberation, as defined in Buddhadharma, can be attained by any other means than realizing the nature of dependent origination and emptiness has not really understood the meaning of the Buddha's teachings on any level. 

In other words Dan, other "wisdom" traditions are mundane paths that are not conducive to liberation. They are paths of samsara.

Some Dharma is the Dharma of gods and humans, it isn't liberating, but it certainly can cause people to take higher rebirth in samsara because in general it encourages people to avoid the ten non-virtues. 

Unfortunately, non-Buddhist Dharmas (and here we really are only talking about religions in which rebirth is accepted) also are contaminated with incorrect views, so whatever wisdom they lead to will only be mundane and contaminated. As the Buddha pointed out, there is no liberation outside of his Dharma and Vinaya. Someone might point out that there so called independent Buddhas (pratyekabuddhas) but it is held that they do not teach, remaining silent about their realization, hence the Buddha's statement, repeated by him in many sūtras through out his life remains true. 

In terms of mixing practices, there is not much point. Someone might respond that Tibetan Buddhism is a mixture of Buddhism and Bon, but this is really a huge overstatement, while it is true that Buddhists adapted some worldly rituals into a Buddhist framwork, such as smoke offerings, and various mundane rites to appease spirits and so on, by no means do they form an essential core of Tibetan Buddhism, since they are palliative rites designed to relieve temporary problems. Buddhism has never had a problem with people continuing to use such practices within the framework of Dharma —&nbsp;we can see this when Buddha instructs Ānanda to rely on brahmins to conduct the Buddha's funerary rites. However, just as you cannot be a citizen of two countries, you cannot have two refuges. One cannot, for example, take refuge in Buddha and Jesus. In other words, there is no reason for a Buddhist who is a former Catholic to take communion since a Buddhist understands that a) there is no such thing as original sin and b) that sins in general cannot be eliminated by washing with water, eating a wafer, etc.

People should remember the vanished Zoroastrian civilization of Persia before claiming that Islam "treated" non-Muslims better than Christians treated pagans. 

In fact, all three Abrahamic religions are fundamentally pernicious which is why the site of their origin is such a total mess and has been for millennia, ever since one band, the Hebrews exterminated another band, the Canaanites.

As far as I am concerned, if Islam and its "contributions" were lost to history like the Zoroastrians, it would be no great loss for humanity.

“Tibetan Buddhism designed by the CCP”
By Woeser
 
Not long ago, several important incidents took place in succession: 1) Because of a minor explosion at the end of October 2011, of the originally over 300 monks only 6 are now left in Karma Monastery in Chamdo County, Kham, TAR. 2) At the end of 2012, Drongna Monastery in Driru County, Nagchu Prefecture, TAR was closed down, all monk residences were sealed and many monks arrested; subsequently, the Tarmoe and Rabten monasteries of Driru County were also closed down. 3) In December 2013, an official government notice was issued to the famous Labrang Monastery in Sangchu County, Gannan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, requesting to expel all non-local monks studying at the monastery within a three months period.

At the end of 2008, I wrote several essays: “‘Patriotic Education’ in Tibet”, “Another Cultural Revolution is Quietly Sweeping across Tibet’s Monasteries”, “Behind the Curtain of ‘Legal Education’”, “The Intentions Behind Transforming Monasteries into Tourist Attractions”, “The ‘Clean Up’ of Lhasa that is Hidden from the Outside World”. It is evident that the encircling and annihilation of Tibet’s monasteries is continuously moving forward, becoming more and more far-reaching. Just as I wrote at the end of 2008, “the local Party authorities are currently launching the cruelest and most bitter clean up of Tibetan monasteries since the Cultural Revolution. In the Chinese media, none of these “black box operations” are ever mentioned. Another Cultural Revolution is currently sweeping across Tibet. In 1966, Buddhist temples and statues were smashed and monks and nuns expelled, leaving behind a forlorn field of ruins. Now this second Cultural Revolution will completely eradicate any genuine monks and nuns, leaving behind nothing but the shell of monasteries and monks and nuns who are bound to lose their courage and conscience.”

If we have not already forgotten, we must remember how on October 4, 2008, the three main monasteries in Lhasa – Drepung monastery, Sera monastery and Ganden monastery – were attacked by military police in the middle of the night, monks – almost entirely students of Buddhism coming from Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, or Yunnan provinces (officially called “the four Tibetan provinces”) – were arrested at their residences. They were sent to Gormo military prison and repatriated to their hometowns after the Beijing Olympics; none of them were allowed to ever return to the monasteries.

It has always been true that more than half of the monks in Lhasa’s three main monasteries were not locals. This is a 500-year-old tradition, existing ever since the establishment of these three main monasteries, and it is the tradition of 2000 years of Buddhism. This, indeed, also includes monasteries of Chinese Buddhism that have always been inhabited by monks from all across the country. Today, Chinese monasteries have remained the same, monks from different counties and provinces reside there to study, but the monks of Lhasa’s three main monasteries have been expelled and imprisoned by military force. This has hardly ever happened in the history of Tibetan Buddhism, it only started occurring frequently in modern times under the rule of the CCP.

If we have not already forgotten, we must remember the official Tibetan document that appeared on the website of the local authorities at the end of 2008; it was a decision issued by the head of the Kardze Autonomous Prefecture targeting all 18 counties of Kardze Prefecture, stating that the local authorities will carry out the following steps against 10-30% of the monasteries whose nuns and monks participated in the protests: any religious events will be forbidden, the movement and actions of nuns and monks will be strictly controlled; all nuns and monks inside monasteries must once again “officially enrol”, all monks and nuns who do not pass the “patriotic education” examination will be expelled, all monks residences will be demolished. As for those who participated in the protests, in minor cases they will be sent back to their hometowns, in severe cases they will be imprisoned.

Starting from 2011, work groups have been stationed inside over 1700 monasteries in the TAR, employing over 7000 members of staff. Altogether, the official number of registered monks and nuns is 46,000; does this mean that each official stationed in a monastery is responsible for 6-7 monks? The problem is that in Karma Monastery, the birthplace of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, for example, officials currently outnumber monks. So does this mean that the goal of this movement, launched by Chen Quanguo and now already experiencing the third change of shifts, is to step-by-step decrease the amount of monks and eventually close down all monasteries?

Meanwhile, the authorities of “the four Tibetan provinces” are equally encircling and attacking the over 150,000 monks and their monasteries. It is impossible that all these local cadres are simply imitating what officials in the TAR do; no, these are clearly the hard-liner policies coming from the highest level. In fact, it is the continuation and implementation of Mao Zedong’s “Tibet Policies”. Mao once said: “We must also reform all monasteries. After successful reform, there will be a time when the number of lamas is greatly reduced… how should we reform monasteries, you should think of a solution.” (May 7, 1959, Guidelines After Putting Down Tibet’s Revolt). This so-called solution seems to be the model that we can observe in today’s Karma and Drongna monasteries and also in Lhasa’s three main monasteries, it is a model of Tibetan Buddhism designed by the CCP.

If you are practicing Avalokiteśvara and Mahāmudra indeed, the sadhana has a kind of guru yoga worked in it. If you are practicing Tsembupa Avaokiteśvara, this is actually an HYT practice and presumes that prior to receiving the instruction you have received both a major empowerment of some kind as well as at least a jenang into Avalokiteśvara. The King's tradition Avalokieśvara major empowerment is often used by HH Sakya Trizen for giving this instruction.

Title: Re: Does Arhat w/o remainder have any existence in Cittamatr

I think it is better to put it in terms of classical Yogacara. For example, Dharmamitra states in his Prasphuṭapadā commentary on the Abhisamayālaṃkara:

This one the Mahāyāna Madhyamikas describes as difficult to have realization, but the Yogacarin assertion that the icchanthika (rigs chad pa) 'burns the seed' slanders tathagātagarbha. 

If you run a search on the term rigs med pa, rather than rigs chad pa, you will find very ample discussion of the concept in the Yogacarin section on the Tengyur. 

For example, Municandra's Sūtrālaṁkāravṛttibhāṣya states:

If one lacking gotra generates [bodhi]citta, the seed will not "take". 

But it is important to keep in mind that the concept of agotra and icchantika comes from the Tathagatagarbha and Yogacarin stream of sutra, specifically the Lanka and the Nirvana. They are a little different from each other. But they are both rejected by Madhyamaka.

There is a limit to how far you can decompose a particle. The point is that Madhyamaka and Yogacara reject the limit proposed by Sautrantika, i.e. partless particles. The point which I mentioned holds true: when the particle one is decomposing ceases to be perceived through analysis, that perceived absence is the emptiness of that particle.

Most so called "Sakya" tulkus are Nyingma reincarnations trained in Sakya through circumstances of region. The Zimog tulkus of Nalendra are a notable exception to this. As I said most of the Sakya tulkus come from East Tibet, which is very removed from Central Tibet. Even here, Sakya in Derge belongs to Ngor, not Tshar, and Sakya monasteries in east Tibet were under the adminstration of Ngor. Of all four schools, Sakya has the least number of tulkus. 

AFA Gelug is concerned —&nbsp;there may be an effort to find Tulkus, but the administration of Gelug is in the hands of educated geshes, not reincarnations, for the most part.

Fundamental to the analysis of the two truths is that when an object is subject to ultimate analysis, it does not remain as an object of cognition.

The Samputa states:

None of the eighty four thousand Dharmaskandhas 
have any result since the true state of the body is not understood.

Since the true state of the body is not taught outside of highest yoga tantra, etc., well then, I leave you to your own conclusions. 

Now then, Ngorchen does clarify in his commentary on kriya tantra that the most a person can aspire to with kriya tantra practice is the tenth bhumi:

"The result accomplished in one life of anuttaratantra is only the perfect Buddhahood of the three inseparable kāyas; here, having relied on the three paths, one can manifest the tenth stage in this [life] and with that support, Buddhahood can be accomplished."

He also explains that even so, the path of kriya tantra is quite slow:

But in kriya tantra, because there is no teaching of taking siddhis apart from (40/a) inviting and creating the deity in front, the speed with which the result is accomplished is slight. The difference with Pāramitāyāna is very important, in that in [Pāramitāyāna] not even taking siddhis from a deity invited in front is ever taught. 


Further, the difficulty with kriya tantra is that it is very precise and requires absolute adherence to ritual purity and so on. This is quite difficult to maintain unless you are in a place like Koyasan, etc. For all of these reasons then it is safe to say that for the most part we can consider kriya tantra ineffective in this day and age (which was my point), which also explains why outside of Shingon and Tendai, no one practices it anymore. There is also the consideration of which yuga a given teaching is most effective or needed, and in this yuga, the kali yuga, annuttarayoga tantra is a desiderata.

Not necessarily. Two major schools of Tibetan Buddhism do not operate this way: the largest, Gelugpa and as well as Sakya. 

The Gelugpas appoint their leaders and teachers through education, not tulku lineages, with the notable exception of the Panchen Lama, who is the head of Tashi Lhunpo monastery. The Dalai Lamas are not monastic heads, but actually part of the Drepung Monastic system. 

The leadership of Sakyapas is held in the Kohn family lineage. The abbocy of Ngor (a subsect of Sakya) is circulated among the scions of four families. It is only in the smallest of the Sakya subsects, Tshar, and Eastern Tibetan Sakya monasteries where tulkus play a significant role in the leadership of monasteries. 

The leadership of Mindroling likewise is held in an old family, and is not tulku based.

Therefore, according to your own reasoning, you yourself must accept that HH Karmapa, Orgyen Thrinly Dorje, is the real Karmapa. And if you don't, you are condemning him. Moreover, you are asserting that the late Shamarpa was wrong in not accepting Tai Situ's candidate. Not only that, but you are equally asserting that Tai Situ is wrong not to accept HH Karmapa, Thrinly Thaye Dorje, as being the real Karmapa. 

The only solution for you then is that you must regard both Karmapas as the same and take teachings from them both. 

Basically what you are saying is that we all must accept all tulku recognitions on faith without question.

It is just a high worldly position. 

Whether the person is a Dharma person or not depends on the qualities of the person in the chair, and not the chair itself. 

There are a lot people with Dharma in their mouths but not in their hearts. "Dharma" words are not necessarily Dharma. 

For example, if we accept that Tibet fell because of the non-virtue of its rulers, for the most part who were they? High tulkus. So you see, these institutional positions are actually quite worldly and there is a huge amount of writing by the people in these position of monastic authority bemoaning the fact that these positions are just worldly fetters that prevent them from practicing.

I did not judge anyone as a false incarnation. In other words, for example, I have no faith in the two Karmapas as incarnations of the 16th Karmapa. But my lack of faith in them as reincarnations has no bearing on whether they are the actual incarnations of the 16th or not. Just to clarify, I have 0 connection with the Karma Kagyu lineage, for whatever reason, just like I have 0 connection with the Gelug lineage. 

As far as pure vision goes, if someone has the idea that even one person is not a fully awakened buddha, their vision is not pure. So, if we are going to take about pure vision, we really need to be clear what we mean. 

I have no obligation to regard teachers other than my own as Buddhas. I am not even obliged to have pure vision of them (other than the same we try to imagine all sentient beings are buddhas in the context of the universe as a buddhamandala). I have no obligation to regard people who are not my teachers as anything more than ordinary worldly people with no special qualities worth mentioning.

The reason why these books are available in Tibetan is because the Tibetan Buddhist Lineage Heads want these books out there so that they won't die. Every book on TBRC has a database entry through which any text can be restricted by tradition of they so choose. There are many books on TBRC that in fact are restricted by tradition. 

When Tibetan lineages send books to TBRC they do so knowing full well that they are openly making these texts available. 

Now, Sherapa has brought up the point of samaya —&nbsp;and this is a valid point. If you are a practitioner, and take lineage seriously, it is better to get permission to read this or that text if you are interested in it. This is the proper approach. On the other hand, a text like Zabmo Nangdon is a general text on tantric anatomy, so in fact anyone who has received HYT empowerment is qualified to read it. 

Even then, the Shambhala "restriction" pages are kind of ludicrous because anyone can just lie if they want to get the book.

The Samye debate was not a debate between Vajrayāna masters and Hashang. Kamalashila was debating a strictly sutrayāna point of view grounded in standard Indian Mahāyāna. Not all Tibetans agree that Kamalashila won the debate either. 

If you want to read a Dzogchen master's treatment of 8th century Northern School Chan, then you need to read Nubchen Sangye Yeshe's "Lamp of the Eye of Dhyāna". One of the interesting things about this text is that it cites scores of Tibetan Chan masters, not just Chinese masters.

Well, not so fast, Kiomosabe, for one thing, the type of Chan Tibetans were exposed to was a Northern School variant. It is very hard to make a case that 10th century Tibetan doxologies apply to the Vajrayāna influenced Zen of the Kamakura period, or even Sung Dynasty Chan. 

Secondly, Nubchen makes it very, very clear that while Chan (as known in Tibet) follows the definitive Mahāyāna sutras, it is not as direct or efficient as Mahāyoga, and addresses the seeming contradiction here inso far as the fact that Chan is supposedly a "sudden" path, where as Mahāyoga is gradual. And of course, he clearly places Atiyoga as the pinnacle of all. 

Third, the idea that one can "realize" Dharmakāya without achieving full buddhahood is somewhat absurd. Sure, we call the emptiness aspect of the mind "the dharmakāya" of the basis, but this does not mean we have realized the result dharmakāya even though there is no substantial difference between the dharmakāya of the basis and the dharmakāya of the result. 

It is very interesting to examine Nubchen's detailed and nuanced arguments.  It is true that Thuken wrote about Chan in 18th century China, but he dismisses it as Yogacara in a short summary fashion. While it is true that Longchenpa and Jigme Lingpa comment briefly on Chan, there is no Tibetan whose treatment of the Chan/Gradualist debate is more authoritative than Nubchen's.

Title: Re: Uninterrupted motivation to practice mindfulness
Content:
Dan, 

One, we have to make a distinction between sṃṛtī and sṃṛtyupasthāna. The former is a mental factor, the latter is "Close placement of mindfulness", familiar to us as the four foundations of mindfulness. 

Secondly, sṃṛtī is always accompanied by saṃprajāna, i.e. attentiveness. These two always work in a pair. 

The point is that we cannot have a mind where kusalacaittas and akusalacaittas are present at the same time -- it's impossible 

This is why even simple exercises of mindfulness, the mundane kind, are useful. For example, mindfulness it is often described by the Buddha means when eating one knows that one is eating, when walking, one knows that one is walking, when wearing pangs, one knows that one is wearing pants. Before you can have "right mindfulness" of the kind that TRC is describing, you have to develop mindfulness. 

But more to the point, when you have the presence of the mental factor of sṃṛtī, the mental factor of vīrya, diligence, is automatically present. Why? Because the kusalacaittas always work in company, where one is found all the other nine are to be found as well. 

Moreover, when the ten kusalacaittas are present, it is impossible for the akusalacaittas to arise in the mind, including the three afflictions referenced above. So therefore, as long as one is mindful and attentive  even in an ordinary way, this eliminates the possibility for the akusalacaittas and the afflictive cittas to arise. 

So the answer to the question is, uy understanding how mind and mental factors function the motivation to practice mindfulness arises merely by understanding how the mind works and taking opportunity of this knowledge. It does not have to be this formal, academic, intellectual trip.

Mindfulness is simply a mental factor. 

Of course there are different objects of mindfulness, but the act of being mindful is the same in so far as it is a mental factor associated with all positive minds. Mindfulness is always beneficial, since it is a kusalacaitta. This does not make mindfulness profound however.

The point here of course is to point out that we are always being mindful of something, unless of course we are distracted by the akusalacaittas,, etc.

A realized guru's job is the teach through body and voice. For example, everything that a teacher like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu (and HH Dalai Lama, HH Sakya Trizin etc.) does is a teaching, the way he walks, dresses, eats, laughs, smiles, frowns, goes to the bathroom, washes, sleeps, wakes up, i.e., the way he lives and the way he dies. 

It is important to make time to spend attending one's guru. But you do not have to spend your life doing so. Even so, serving the guru is an important part of practice, and the fastest, most excellent way to earn merit.

In reality all a guru can do is show one the path. There is nothing a guru can do more than that. There is nothing you can do more than receive their transmission and practice. You practice, and when you have questions, you ask. That's it. His or her job is to give transmission, your job is to apply transmission and realize what they have realized.

Nevertheless, without a realized teacher of Dzogchen, it is difficult to make any progress on the path Of Dzogchen. If one does not have confidence that one's teacher is really a buddha, well, one will not make much progress on the path no matter how much one practices this or that technique.

Content:
There are 21 types of capacties of practitioners. Only the best of the best attain great transference body, i.e., rainbow body in this life. Virtually all others attain it in the bardo, or failing that, in a pure nirmanakāya buddhafield.

In the end, since you will hear many different answers from students, it is always better to ask Rinpoche himself personally. The reason you will hear many different answers is that Rinpoche has given many different answers to different students at various times in different circumstances. 

In general, this ngondro practice can be practiced if you have the lung of the text, and Rinpoche often uses methods of introduction which are from Longsal such as the Yeshe Zangthal. He will give the lung if requested. 

But when you have questions and are really not sure, it is always better to ask him directly.

It is not about superiority -- you might as well chant Namo Mickey Mouse, based on your own stated belief I've read that scientific studies have revealed that chanting (no matter the religion) is good for mental health because the rhythm of chanting corresponds with that of the pulse of brain activity. Such ideas really have nothing to do with Buddhadharma.

Modernity has yet to come to terms with desire, hatred and ignorance. 

There is nothing particularly noble about "modernity" (read, post-Hegelian Western culture) and nothing especially difficult about living in a so called modern culture. Sentient beings are still the same —&nbsp;afflicted by the three poisons —&nbsp;and Buddhadharma is still relevant to that state of affairs and always will be.

There is nothing here to counter, this is just a Buddhist matter of fact. It is not fatalistic at all. All beings make their own karma, both the good and the bad. 

I can no more change your karma than you can change mine. But as human beings, we can act with compassion, and perhaps inspire others. 

However, please do recall the Buddha watched the Vajjians enslave all his relatives...
