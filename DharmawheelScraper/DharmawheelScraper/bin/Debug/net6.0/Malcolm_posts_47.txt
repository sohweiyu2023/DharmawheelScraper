The Mahāyāna Buddhist point is that a given class of beings share a similar experience of a container universe because they have similar karma ripening at the same  time. You can understand this through the classic example of humans, devas, asuras, animals, pretas and hell beings all experiencing liquids differently, as water, nectar, a home, pus and blood or molten iron. Specifically the yogacara school regards the entire container universe to consist only of projections caused by the ripening of traces.

Yes, since the former takes the latter as relative truth. Kalaśīla's Madhyamakālaṃkārapañjikā states:

Since the five characteristics of external cause and condition and and the dominant characteristic are false, existing as mind-only [cittamatra] is only non-arising in the manner of representation-only [vijñapati-matra]. Therefore, whatever the non-arising of the madhyamaka school might be, that demonstrates it.

Mere clarity is an extreme. That is why Dzogchen texts say thing like "Because it is empty, it is free from the extreme of existence; because it is clear, it is free from the extreme of nonexistence" and so on, when describing the mind-essence. 

Lamdre texts say basically the same thing, as do Kagyu texts. 

This is why we have the description of the mind essence as "the inseparability [thugs rje] of clarity [rang bzhin] and emptiness [ngo bo]". In reality, since the two truths are inseparable, so is clarity and emptiness.

Subjectively speaking, all internal appearances are just mental images, whether those appearances are derived from your eyes up to your skin. 

When you "see" a mountain, you are not aware of the direct perception of that mountain, since it is non-conceptual. What you are aware of is a secondary or derived perception which is an image of the mountain that your eye has captured. Gzhan stong has no theory of perception different than this. 

The external mountain is an entity that is capable of appearing because of the force of traces of the minds of all sentient beings. Shabkar uses the example of the woman who meditated upon herself as a tiger for a year, and frightened a village into slaying her because they perceived her as a tiger and not a human woman.

This is not cittamatra view, this is Shantarakṣita's yogacara synthesis, where the view of relative truth is held to be cittamatra, and the view of ultimate truth is madhyamaka. Earlier Madhyamakas generally adopt the Sautrantika view for the most part for relative truth. But even here, no one confuses one's perception of the mountain, the mental image, with the mountain itself.

Of course not. One can experience only one's mind. For this reason Shabkar states in Flight of the Garuda:

Title: Re: The basis is one's unfabricated mind
Content:
Two problems here. While it is clear that Dzogchen definitely posits the basis as a set of generic characteristics that belong to individual minds, it does not posit that appearances are mental factors. Shabkar clarifies that the delusions of sentient beings are sufficiently strong so as to generate what seem to be concrete appearances for one another. This is why, for example, mountains do not disappear when we cease looking or thinking of them. So it is not accurate to parse this discussion in terms of a Cittamatra/gzhan stong split. 

What is however true is that we can only experience the contents of our own minds, whether those minds are liberated or not. The basis mythos runs as follows: when the five lights are perceived, those five lights come from potency [rtsal] of our own minds and no where else. If we reify them as external to our own minds, then we fall into samsara. This is happening all the time. To reverse this, one must practice thogal working with entoptic visions that are understood to be produced internally, not externally. If you do not work with these visions, practicing merely tregchö, one will not be able to purify those traces in our minds that give rise to impure vision, though we may be able to realize the mind-essence and dissolve our bodies at death, we will never be able to realize the body of light.

Dzogchen practitioner are fond of saying that Dzogchen practice works with "wisdom" [ye shes] and not mind [rnam shes, sems], and this is true, but only because of a very specialized vocabulary which sharply defines the originally pure mode of consciousness [ye shes] from its derivative impure mode [rnam shes], for want of better terms in English.

I never claimed reality existed, therefore I am free of the fault of claiming it does not exist. When someone points out your bank account is empty, is it their fault that you have no money? Have they destroyed money you thought you had? Of course not. It is the same when stating "there is no reality". This is merely pointing out the conclusion of freedom from all extremes. 

Āryānantamukhapariśodhananirdeśaparivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
The Sugata said "existence" and "nonexistence" are extremes; whatever does not exist in the extremes, that also does not exist in the middle.

Ārya-varmavyūhanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra
Since this vehicle is without extremes, 
also the extreme of the middle does not exist.

Ārya-kāśyapaparivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Kāśyapa, "permanence" is one extreme; impermanence is the second extreme. Whatever is the middle of those two extremes, that also cannot be examined.

Sampuṭanāma mahātantra:

There is nothing empty, not empty, 
and nothing to perceive in the middle.

The Meditation on Bodhicitta:

The nonexistence dependent on existence does not exist, also that nonexistence does not exist. Because the extremes do not exist, the middle does not exist, also do not rest in the middle. 

The sgra thal gyur:

Because of being free from extremes, do not abide in the middle.

So we can clearly see that sutra and tantra agree on one point, i.e. there is no reality in the extremes, and there is no reality beyond the extremes. Ergo, there is no reality, since reality would have to be either existence or non-existence and so on.

No, it isn't. 

If you maintain that your mind-essence is just emptiness, that would be the downfall indicated. An unfabricated mind means a mind which is free from all proliferation, when the mind's own freedom from proliferation is not recognized, that mind becomes the basis for samsara; when it is recognized, that mind becomes the basis for nirvana. 

However, as Jetsun Rinpoche points out, for beginners it is sufficient to recognize that phenomena are like dreams and illusions despite the fact that in reality they are free from names, etc.

It may not be not what you have understood, it is in fact the intent of Madhyamaka to point out that there is no reality, per se. Saying there is "no reality" [gnas lugs med pa] is quite different than saying reality does not exist. In fact it is basic "Heart Sutra" and is non-controversial.

What I mean by simple is what Sapan wrote:

"The eleventh is conceptualizing those 
phenomena which are free from name and so on."

[This means] conceptualizing phenomena free from name and so on as being phenomena free from name and so on. In brief, if one maintains that all phenomena which lack inherent existence [ngo bo nyid med, svabhāva] and are free from proliferation as being emptiness, it is a fundamental downfall. 

As Berzin points out, this is related to the ninth, expressed by Sapan here:

"The ninth is doubt about
the naturally pure dharmatā"

The primal nature [rang bzhin, prakṛti] of all phenomena is free from proliferation. Since that is not understood, the doubt "Is [the nature of all phenomena] free from proliferation or not?" is a fundamental downfall. 


When we consider the eleventh downfall, this effectively means that labeling phenomena as emptiness, when in fact they are free from proliferation, is a downfall. 

The ninth basically means that a Vajrayāna practitioner should maintain the view at all times. 

The qualm might come, how is a beginner to avoid the 11th downfall? Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen provides an answer: 

"A beginner should think though indeed all phenomena are free from names, relatively, all phenomena appear like dreams and illusions", constantly training their minds in the example of illusion."

Yes, when you have attained the first dhyāna, you have the capacity to remain in that for as long as you want with no discomfort. It doesn't matter if it is 20 minutes or twenty hours. 

The downside of the 1st dhyana is that it is easy to become addicted to it. Then you are just creating traces for rebirth in the form realms. So I think Wallace is being a little bit sutrayāna in his approach here. However, being able to sit comfortable in one posture for a long while is definitely beneficial for longde and thogal practice.

Chetsun has a student called Myang bka' dam pa, thus this places him after 1042, the year Atishas arrives in Purang. So Chetsun's datable era of activity must be between 1042 and around 1064 (the most probably date for the passing of Drogmi according to Davidson). This means that if Zhang ston is correct about when Chegom visited Chetsun's place of attaining rainbow body, this had to have happened roughly in around 1048, though this is maybe a little too soon. 

The whole thing hinges on the identity of "Myang bka' dam pa". Since he knew lDang ma,  this places lDang ma squarely in the eleven century. I really can't believe that that 17 tantras, in general, are earlier than lDang ma. lDang ma's death cannot be earlier than mid 11th century, which places his meeting with Chetsun in the late 1040's. Of course it is possible they were written in the first half of the 11th century, but for various reasons it is my present opinion that it is unlikely that any of them predate 1000. They demonstrate far too much influence from gsar ma tantras to be very early. 

As far as I can tell, Zhang ston's own dates are a little unrealistic, apart from his date for the Buddha's Parinirvana, but he clearly reporting what Chegom told him about Chetsun and lDangma.

It's based on a mystical book called the dge ldan sgyu phrul legs bam, the miraculous book of Ganden. According to legend, it is a book passed down to dben sa pa aka rgyal ba blo bzang don grub. There is but a single copy, and it is claimed that whenever the owner of this book needs to know something related to sutra and tantra, the answer miraculously appears in it. Indeed, Ganden Chod, Mahāmudra and the bLa ma mchod pa are supposed to be sourced in this book. Interestingly, Samten Karmey discovered a manuscript in Bhutan which is definitely from the dben sa pa lineage that bore the name blo bzang bka' 'bum. Thus the legend was grounded in fact. These days, the main promulgators of the myth of the dge ldan sgyu phrul legs bam are the Shugden folks, since they believe that this miraculous book was passed to Pabhonkga, and he to Trijiang Rinpoche. Of course, HHDL quipped once that the real dye ldan sgyu phrul legs bam was the 18 volumes of Lama Tsongkhapa's collected works. According to Karmay, the dge ldan bka' rgyud both represents the views of Lama Tsongkhapa when he was younger and also "leans" Nyingma.  It has always been a little controversial in Gelugpa.

Indeed, but it is the job of the student to increase their capacity, and sectarianism generally arises from feeling that one's teachers presentation is sufficient, or the best, without having properly examined the presentations of others. This is why a lot of hostility on the part of some Nyingmas, Kagyus and Sakya against the views of Lama Tsongkhapa are frankly ridiculous, likewise the hostility of some Gelugpas against the views of Gorampa and Dolbuwa, and so on.

We have every reason to doubt the lo rgyus chen mo. It is a piece of religious fiction. Anyway, this is the chronology given by Zhangton himself:

0 Parinirvana of the Buddha
360 AP Birth of Vajraprahe
544 AP Mañjuśrīmitra meet Vajraprahe
830 AP Shri Siṃha meets Mañjuśrīmitra
984 AP Shri Siṃha’s parinirvana
994 AP Jñānasūtra’s parinirvana
1080 AP Vimala arrives in Tibet
1093 AP Vimala leaves for China
1148 AP Nyang erects Zhwa Gon and conceals the texts
1358 AP lDang ma discovers the termas
1388 AP lDang ma gives them to lCe bTsun
1568 AP Zhang ston bKra Shis rDo rJe removes the unsurpassed secret cycle. 

If we consider that Vimala arrives in Tibet after the death of Trisrong Detsen (which really is a certainty), but before 20, this means according to Nyinthig chronology, Buddha's parinirvana was between 390-370. By Zhangton's own dates them, he revealed the Vima Nyingthig between 1178-1198, which is obviously too late because he had passed alway already. If we move the dates fifty years earlier, it gives an approximate date of 1128 for the revelation of the Nyinthig. Though it is often held that Zhangton med Chetsun directly, in fact this was only a visionary encounter on a brigde in Tsang between 1122-1128 after Zhangton had already revealed the Vima Nyinthig. He says at the end of the Lo rgyus chen mo:

As such, thirty years later, having gone to the place where lCe bTsun disappeared lCe sGom Nag po of mNar mDa’ in Rong took out the outer, inner and secret oral lineage and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from himself. These then spread widely in dBus and gTsang. Fifty years after the revelation by lCe sGom, I removed these unsurpassed secret cycles and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from myself. At this time, one thousand five hundred sixty eight years have elapsed since the Buddha’s parinirvana.

The Mu tig phreng ba commentary treats the 17 tantras as a single collection, but whether it was composed before or after the Vima Nyinthig is very hard to say. 

It is true that there is a mention of a text called the klong drug on folio 17a, and there is also a text mentioned called the vi ma la klong 'grel which is mentioned three times, as mentioned by Dylan Esler in his article. However, this is extremely uncertain evidence. Until someone actually goes through the whole of the extant klong drug commentary, we cannot be sure that this commentary attributed to Vimalamitra is in fact the same as the one mentioned by Nubchen, don't you agree? 

There is a second issue, which is we don't really know exactly when the bSam gtan mig sgron was composed, but it certainly could not be earlier than circa 1000 CE. 

So, as far as I am concerned this still leaves the seventeen tantras as roughly early 11th century compositions, since the first external mention of them is in the Vima Nyinthig, which was definitely composed around 1122 by Zhangston.

Chetsun Senge Wangchuk supposedly assisted Drogmi by giving him gold with which to donate to Gayadhara and so on. 

The reason why no one in India had ever heard of the man ngag sde teachings is that they never existed in India at all, and were constructed by Tibetans in the 11th century. Not all Nyingma tantras were composed/revealed by Tibetans, but the Dzogchen tantras, in my opinion(as I have mentioned frequently) most certainly were composed/revealed strictly by Tibetans and never existed in India, ever, nor even "Oddiyāna".

The practice of completion stage is what causes one to achieve buddhahood. It is not merely for "reducing attachment" to the creation stage. On the other hand, what he may mean is the "completion" stage practice of dissolving the deity. This still cannot be construed as "secondary" since in a Nyingma sadhana practice, this is where one rests in tregchơ̈.

In actual practice, when you are reciting the sadhana, you just recite it clearly, i.e. without distraction; intensely, i.e. you know what you are saying, and quickly, without lingering on any part of the sadhana until you come to the end. 

Let us say you are meditating the Hevajra mandala, there there are thirty-two topics. You pick one topic per session. For example, in the beginning, for the most part, one focuses on cultivating divine pride "I am yidam X". The one focuses on getting the central eye correct. Why? Because this causes the vāyu to begin to settle in the central channel. Then you move from one to the other. Eventually, by switching topics from on to another, you can immediately recall a generic image of the whole deity without any effort. Then you can dispense with this. You don't spend hours and hours trying to get each detail perfect. 

In one session you apply both some equipoise on one aspect of the mandala or another, and then one does some completion stage practice, right from the very beginning. When you are doing completion stage practice, you only focus on what you need for that completion stage practice. 

Mantra recitation is considered a post-equipoise practice in Sakya because it involves activity. In Nyingma, focusing on the mantra rosary is generally considered the main practice of the creation stage, and resting in the nature of the mind at the end is considered to be the main completion stage. 

Even if you are a fantastic "Dzogchen" practitioner, if you recite mantras in a state of distraction, they won't work. So in fact, whether you are doing some elaborate practice like Hevajra, or an Anuyoga practice like Dragphur, you need to have good, stable concentration, otherwise your mantras won't work. The whole point of creation stage is to develop your concentration to the point that your mantras work easily and swiftly. If you think that mantras like the 25 spaces are some exception, they are not. In this case they function only if you are in a state of natural repose, unfettered equipoise i.e. cog bzhag. 

Rongzom makes the point very clearly that Dzogchen practitioners must develop the mental factors that characterize the first dhyana, vitarka, vicara, pritvi, sukha and ekagraha, i.e. applied attention, sustained attention, physical ease, mental ease and one-pointedness. If you do not have a stable śamatha practice, you can't really call yourself a Dzogchen practitioner at all. At best, you can call yourself someone who would like to be a Dzogchen practitioner a ma rdzogs chen pa. People who think that Dzogchen frees one from the need to meditate seriously are seriously deluded. The sgra thal 'gyur clearly says:

The faults of not meditating are:
the characteristics of samsara appear to one, 
there is self and other, object and consciousness, 
the view is verbal, 
the field is perceptual, 
one is bound by afflictions,
also one throws away the path of the buddhahood, 
one does not understand the nature of the result, 
a basis for the sameness of all phenomena does not exist,
one's vidyā is bound by the three realms, 
and one will fall into conceptuality

The fact creation and completion practices like caṇḍalī yoga are brought up in the seventeen tantras themselves and their commentarial literature proves that they are important. 

The main principle of the creation stage of developing divine pride. I really don't know how much experience you have of doing elaborate creation stage practices, but your comments betray a lack of familiarity about how such creation stage is actually done in practice. Many Dzogchen/Nyingma practitioners, unfamiliar with the fine details of "gsar ma" tantras, have the idea that "sudden" or instant creation is only a principle of Anuyoga. However, the Laghusamvara Tantra explicitly teaches instant creation as well as gradual creation. The general consideration is one of experience. In the gsar ma schools, the more elaborate creation stage practices are for beginners, while advanced practitioners rely on instant creation stages. You can read about this in the Lamdre book. 

In addition, there are very few people who practice thögal seriously. As Khenpo Ngachung mentions, principally thogal is used these days to stabilize tregchö. Most Dzogchen practitioners are not going to realize the body of light. Most practitioners are going attain realization in the bardo, if at all. If you maintain your samayas, no matter what system of Vajrayāna you practice, you will achieve Buddhahood within seven lifetimes, i.e. if you maintain your samayas, you are functionally equivalent to a stream entrant. Contrary to popular belief, Dzogchen practitioners also need to maintain their samayas (plural), not just the groovy ones like non-existence, ubiquity, singleness and natural perfection (which can't be broken anyway).

Nonsense. For example, the Vima Nyinthig has a detailed text on praṇāyama called the rlung gyi phra khrid, which gives sets of practices that are very important for Dzogchen practitioners. Praṇāyama, not important at all in sutrayāna meditation, is extremely important in Dzogchen. Likewise, the notion that view to be meditated is conferred through experiences gained during the empowerment. Not only this, but the whole contextualization of practice is completely based on the systems of nāḍīs and cakras in the human body and so on. 

The supreme empowerment means, accordingto The Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva:


There are three kinds of empowerments, outer, inner and secret.The outer empowerment is the mandala of colored powder...The empowerments are conferred sequentially. The location of conferring them is the brahmarandhra. Having complete the outer and inner empowerments as such, one should enter into the secret empowerment. There are three syllables...As such, having completed the three empowerments, one should bestow the instructions to be bestowed. The yoga who has the complete empowerments will definitely become accomplished. The illustration of the meaning of secret mantra is granted through empowerment.

In general, the ancient texts and commentaries assume that a person who wants to practice Dzogchen will receive all four empowerments, elaborate, unelaborate and so on. Of course, the system of the direct introduction does exist in the seventeen tantras, but it is generally considered to be given only on the basis of the elaborate and so on empowerments, just as so-called "sems sde" was generally only conferred to people who had received at minimum the Guhyagarbha empowerment. "Longde" as we know, can only be practiced on the basis of an anuyoga empowerment. 

And in point of fact, the Dzogs pa rang 'byung tantra mainly concerns mahayoga and anuyoga methods, various kinds of maha and anu style empowerments, as well as elaborate rites for leading practitioners through the bardo. The commentary on the sgra thal 'gyur has a very elaborate Vajravār̄ahī practice as well as other creation stage practices. These are discussed in the commentary to this passage:

Amazing, though there are countless stages
of ultimate secret practice, 
by dividing the principle ones,
[the one of] method and [the one of] supremely profound prajñā
are summarized from them.

In actuality, Dzogchen is always contextualized as a part of secret mantra in the seventeen tantras themselves.

The actual practice of Dzogchen is unifying the three inner tantras. When we talk about essence nature and compassion, this is really just a riff on the three samadhis of mahāyoga, etc. I.e.:

The samadhi of suchness = essence
The samadhi of universal appearance = nature
The samadhi of the cause = compassion

One of the seventeen tantras, The Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva explains:

Again he replied “Oh Vajraholder, listen! After my Nirvana, teach this to sentient beings of the future. Generation stage Mahāyoga is like the basis of all Dharma. Completion state Anuyoga is the like the path of all Dharma. Great Perfection Atiyoga is the like the result of Dharma. Therefore, the meaning of the inseparability of the trio of creation and completion is understood as the three syllables. [9/a] If it is asked what those are, they can be understood with Oṃ Aḥ Hūṃ. Therefore, hold in mind what I have clearly demonstrated. Without arising or ceasing, Oṃ exists in oneself. Without birth and death, Āḥ exists oneself. Inseparable, Hūṃ exists in oneself. The single unwritten tantra exists in oneself. The single undemonstrated agama exists in oneself.  The intimate instruction that discloses one’s vidyā exists in oneself. The lamp of the essence of wisdom is very bright. The meaning of the six yānas are to be understood in three. The meaning of the six syllables are to be understood in three syllables. The tantra must be unraveled with the meaning of the trio of creation and completion to sentient beings of the future. The three syllables exist in all sentient beings. Therefore, in terms of accomplishment, explained Accomplishment Mahāyoga using the ground; explain Agama Anuyoga using space; and explained Upadesha Dzogchen using the sun and moon. The confirmation of the ultimate garbha is to be understood with this tantra.”

And:

From that basis existing in the form of a halo of light, the so called “causal condition” is the actual ignorance. Since that becomes an intellectual analysis, it is called the “dominant condition”. Since is apprehended subjectively, it is called “the object condition”. For example, like face of a person shown to a mirror. Since those three happen at the same time, it is called “the immediately simultaneous and antecedent condition”. 
That is one’s own basis but it was not recognized by oneself. The samsaric three realms are formed through delusion.

This tantra also demonstrates the fault of not receiving empowerment:

The demonstration of the fault of not obtaining the supreme empowerment is that the yogin, for example, will be like a boatman with out an oar, unable to deliver to the other side. If the supreme empowerment is obtained, the secret mantra that is not accomplished will be accomplished.


When it comes to the unique feature of Dzogchen, it lies in the the anatomy of thögal, and that's about it. But even in this respect, that fact that path depends on human physical anatomy classifies it along with other highest yoga tantra systems.

It is inane to discuss things like a basis without discussing what a basis is a basis of (samsara and nirvana). That discussion of the basis of samsara and nirvana is only meaningful with regards to sentient beings. And yes, we are referring to an ālaya of sentient beings, not in the specialized man ngag sde usage of the term, where it refers only to ignorance, but in the more general way, in the way it is used in non-man ngag sde, in some terma cycles like the dgongs pa zang thal, and in the gsar ma schools.

Heat is an abstraction derived from instantiations of fire. 

The basis is an abstraction derived from instantiations of sapients, both buddhas and sentient beings. Conventionally speaking, samanya-lakṣanas (universals) are considered completely unreal, as opposed to svalaḳsanas (particulars), which are allowed a certain species of conventional reality.

The basis is the description of the dharmatā of dharmins. Without a dharmin, a dharmatā is unintelligible, so in the end, the Dzogchen presentation of the basis is not nearly as radical as it is made out to be.

It is the minds of illusory buddhas and sentient beings. Why is this not a problem? The basis is an abstraction, thus it is not real apart from its instantiations. The basis merely describes the potentiality of the mind's innate nature as the three kāyas and how the mind can deviate from that nature.  In other words, one's unfabricated mind is the mirror.

Yes, these cycles do work on cosmic as well as personal levels. The process of the development as well as the disappearance of our bodies mimics the process of the development and disappearance of the elements in the universe, and the same cycle is repeated through waking and sleeping, etc. But this mimesis does not bear the consequence that the general basis, a set of properties inherent to all sentients, be they buddhas or beings, is a universal mind-stratum. Consciousness permeates all sentient beings, without all sentient beings having the same consciousness.

Yes, and other Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, generally only tulkus are cultivated for lineage holder training, unless, in the case of Nyingma familiy lineages, you are trained in the terma ritual cycle specific to your family. 

In Gelug, however, you have to study for years and years, then you have to study some more in tantric college, then you have to study some more. By the time you are a qualified lineage holder you have spent 30+ years as a scholar/practitioner and are at least in your early forties if not fifties, having only started serious Vajrayāna training in your early thirties or forties. 

Even in Sakya however, even if you belong to the Khon or one of the Ngor palaces, you are not automatically selected for such training, you have to show aptitude and interest from a very young age. For this reason, none of HH Dagchen Rinpoche sons were selected for/chose to undergo such training, but his grandson is being trained to succeed HE Ratnavajra at some point. In Ngor, the abbotship traditionally shifted every few years between Khenpos from that family. However, circumstances have lead to the Abbacy of Ngor being defacto in the hands of the Luding family at this point, the senior Luding Khenpo being the uncle of the junior Luding (who is the son of HE Jetsun Kusho). The Tshar lineage however has, as far as I know, been more of a meritocracy since it is based out of Nalendra Phenpo, which was the toughest academic school in Pre-modern Tibet. It still has family connections, but also some important Tullkus, like the Zimog Tulkus. In Derge, the Sakya school depends mostly on tulkus for succession, as that is the eastern Tibetan preference or so it seems. But they send them to Ngor for their education, for the most part.

To be a lineage holder in the Sakya lineage requires training from early childhood. 

The families involved in these lineages preserve not because they are private clubs but because it is what these families do and have done for many centuries. It is one thing to be a practitioner, it is quite another to be lineage holder.

I personally generally go along with HHDL's point of view on both these matters, as does HHST, but I know there are others who disagree with him and feel that their own reasons are equally valid.

We don't have a stake in the game. This basically a power struggle between the Gelugs and conservative Karma Kagyus that has been going on since the war between the King of Tsang and the Ganden Phodrang in the 17th century. All of this politicking comes from that time. 

[qupte]
If I am completely honest, this resurfaced for me recently upon Akong Rinpoche's death, I knew him very well, for many years, and was shocked...so i reacted badly to the negative comments by various Shamar students. My bad.[/quote]

It is not your bad at all. This a part of your life and history. It is just good to recognize that it is very worldly, on both sides. If you are a Karma Kagyu however, you have to make a decision who is going to be your leader. 

But frankly, all this makes me understand that the family lineage holder model has certain strengths that the other two models, i.e. Tulku succession, or nominated abbotships, as in  the throne of Ganden, somewhat lack. While all are subject to manipulation, the family lineage thing has more resistance to external manipulation, at minimum. On the other hand, the Gelug model is appealing too because the head of the Gelug school is nominated on the basis of their scholarship and practice rather then money and power. So, of the three, I think the Tulku system is the weakest. However, it has the most appeal because it allows cults of personality to extend through time in an unprecedented way.

Hi Stewart:

This not a fair assessment of the situation. 

The "Shamar" candidate was first recognize by Chogye Trichen Rinpoche, who many assert was the most realized Tibetan teacher in a century. Trinley Thaye was granted the entire sgyud sde kun 'dus by the senior Luding Khenpo in California in a private teaching that lasted for some months. 

This is not the first time in history there has been more than one recognized Karmapa. In the end, it just becomes a money and power game. That, sadly, is what the tulku system has largely degenerated into, in my opinion. 

The fact that Orgyen Thaye Dorje is accorded "more" respect has more to do with HHDL's patronage than anything else, as far as I can discern. He has also been something of a hostage to the Ganden Podrang, however, and given the history between the Karmapas and the Ganden Phodrang, I can see why this makes many Karma Kagyus very uncomfortable. 

The fact remains that the Karma Kagyu school suffered a blow to their reputation because of the controversy. You cannot blame one side more than the other, unless you are a partisan. 

As someone with virtually no connection to Karma Kagyu, who has no stake in the game on any side, I think the whole affair is a sad mess and has weakened the Karma Kagyu school considerably.

No, it renders compassion impartial, which is the step before "objectless". 

The buddhas and ārya-bodhisattvas do not make a distinction between a torturer and a victim, so why should we? It does not mean we do not intercede where we can to protect the victims, or convince the victimizers to restrain their violence, but we certainly do not judge the victimizer to be any other than a suffering sentient being. Extending compassion impartially does not condone those deeds acted out of the three poisons, nor does it condone the karmic ripening of those whose negative karma is ripening upon them. Your extension of compassion to the victims of a flood will have no impact on the ripening of their karma, will prevent no deaths, will not stem the loss of property and suffering. Your extension of compassion to the victims of war will not indict war criminals, nor save them from the fruit of their own actions. 

Compassion needs to be wed with equanimity in order for compassion to become impartial. Otherwise, compassion swiftly turns into recrimination and judgement and bias. 

When we bring to mind our bodhicitta vows we are not saying, "I vow to do this practice just to save only the sentient beings I like", we are saying "I am practicing the six perfections in order to become a Buddha so that I might rescue all beings from samsara."

In the end, we Mahāyāna Buddhist practitioners seek to develop objectless, unconditional compassion. 

So what do we do? We try to stem what suffering we see, and we wish that the suffering we cannot address in others as well as ourselves be pacified. That is all we can do, and nothing more. Compassion is nothing more and nothing less than the wish that sentient beings be free from suffering. All sentient beings are suffering at all times. Some suffering is more obvious than others, which is the suffering we tend to focus on. We need to understand that the nature of samsara is suffering through and through. When we understand this, we can then understand that we should experience compassion for those sentient beings who are involved in heavy actions of warring against unarmed people, as well as the people being warred against and so on. No sentient being is less deserving of our compassion as bodhisattvas than any other.

If they could have succeeded in installing a communist Government in Bhutan as well as Nepal, this is would have been very powerful for them and China. Unfortunately, the Nepali immigrants got caught up in this "liberation" movement, which is just marxist colonialism, and now we have the present situation. In any event, the US alone between 2008 and 2012 have taken in 65,000+ of these immigrants, so in the end, I think they will all do fine.

The Lhotsampas (southern border people) however are a recent immigrant population, their history is long and complicated. Many Lhotsampas do not want to adhere to Buddhadharma, nor do they wish to adhere to essentially non-Nepalese cultural norms. The people who in camps are those who could not prove a pre 1958 citizenship. They are all culturally Nepalese, speaking Nepalese dialects, but Nepal won't have them which is all the more ironic because the present current Maoist government fomented and exacerbated the unrest. The best solution would be for Nepal to absorb them, since they are Nepalese people. The situation was not aided by the fact that Lotshampas responded with armed violence to the 1988 census which showed large numbers of them were illegal aliens in Bhutan. In fact, much of the unrest was agitated by the Communist Party of Nepal:

Some villagers willingly joined the protests; others did so under duress. The government branded the party, reportedly established by anti-monarchists and backed by the Nepali Congress Party and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), as a terrorist organization. The party allegedly led its members – said to be armed with rifles, muzzle-loading guns, knives, and homemade grenades – in raids on villages in southern Bhutan, disrobing people wearing traditional Bhutanese garb; extorting money; and robbing, kidnapping, and killing people. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhotshampa

All of the above is very characteristic of how the Maoists in Nepal behaved while they were fighting the government. They hate Buddhism, and will stop at nothing to try and destroy Buddhism in the Himalayas in the interest of their Chinese masters. 

The Bhutanese are trying their best to maintain a Buddhist kingdom surrounded on all sides by tīrthikas and enemies, and so from that point of view I think what they are doing is admirable. They observed what happened to Sikkim and determined that the same fate was not going to happen to them. 

It may not seem pretty or nice, but as Bhutan is the last independent Vajrayāna Kingdom in the world, I have no problems with their desire to maintain the Buddhist culture of Bhutan intact without having to accommodate those of other cultures in their midst.

The Kilaya completion stage practices, as far as I know, have not survived beyond a tummo practice. 

As for these other rumors, well, there are always some intimate instruction or another that is not generally taught. Yogini has some sections that are taught to only three people, or one person at a time. Lamdre also has some transmissions that are one to one. Then there are other teachings like outer, inner and secret Mahakala practices that are not widely promulgated.

Infant mortality rate dropped 50% in one year in Bhutan, between 2007 and 2008 and is steadily declining.

Life expectancy in Bhutan also increased the same year, between 2007 and 2008. What this means is that the high infant mortality rate (110.9) in 2000 was being factored in. When that dropped by half in 2008, the life expectancy jumped from 52 in 2000 to its present 67.88 years. If they lower their infant morality rate again by half, you will see another jump in life expectancy.

What the Buddha said actually was, until you know for yourself, you need to take it on faith from someone who does. 

The Kalamas sutta for example is much misunderstood in that it was taught to non-Buddhists. 

But the Eastern Gatehouse Sutta explains very clearly that until you have that taste of nirvana, which is of course based on understand dependent origination, the four noble truths and so on, you must accept the Dharma as it is taught from someone who does know. Hence the crucial importance of having a master of genuine realization. 

Further, faith, in Dharma, is defined as a mental factor that brings clarity to the mind. Of course we don't want blind faith, but aspiring faith is also weak, since if your role model disappoints you, you might abandon Dharma after all. What we are looking for in Buddhadharma is unshakable faith such that if 1000 buddhas showed up and said "Sorry, it was all a mistake" you would not believe them. 

Faith is one of the five faculties and one of the five powers. It is the very foundation of the path to nirvana, which is why it is considered one of the 8 transcendent faculties.

This is an extract from a history of Sakya that I wrote for Lama Migmar Tseten which appears in Treasures of the Sakya Lineage published by Shambhala. 

The Khon trace their origin to a class of gods called Wosel Lha, gods of luminous clarity. 
The Annals of the Khon Lineage (gdung rabs), cites the fifteenth century author, Ngorchen Kunchog Lhundrup:
The line of emanations of Mañjuśṛī,
The Glorious Sakyapa, begins in the country of the Gods of Luminous Clarity. 
There were three brothers,  Chiring, Yuring, and Yuse.
Yuse, having been made a king of humans, bore four sons. 
His elder brother, Yuring, came to his aid. 
The sons of Yuring and Muza Dembu
were the group of the seven Maza. The six oldest brothers
with their father returned to the land of the gods.
The youngest son, Masang Chije 
and Thogcham Wurmo bore a son, Pawo Tag.
Both he and his Naga wife, Trama, bore a son
called  Lutsa Tagpo Woechan.
Lutsa and the Mon lady Tsomo Gyal
while living together bore a son
at the divide between slate and grass, 
and so he was named Yapang Kyes,
a hero that could not be defeated by others.
In a definitive sense Mañjuśṛī is held to have emanated as three gods of luminous clarity, the gods named Chiring, Yuring and Yuse or Use in order to benefit others. It is of great importance too that these gods are considered emanations of Mañjuśṛī, since all males of the Khon line are considered to be descendents as well as emanations of the Bodhisattva Mañjuśṛī. 
These three brothers descended to the human realm where they were asked to become the ruler of human beings. 
The youngest brother of the gods, Yuse, was elevated to the position of the ruler. He himself bore four sons, known as the four  Se Chi Li brothers. Together they fought with the eighteen major tribes of the Dong , one of the four original clans of Tibet.  The middle brother, Yuring, came to aid them, and after the Dong clan was subjugated, The Dong were made vassals. 
Yuring himself married a daughter of the Mu,  Muza Dembu,  and they bore the seven Masang brothers. Of those seven, the eldest six returned to the country of the Gods with their father. 
The youngest of the Masang brothers, Masang Chije, remained among human beings. He married Thogcham Wurmo, the daughter of the Thoglha Woedchan, they bore a son known as Thogtsad Bangpo Tag. 
Thogtsad married Lucham Drama, the daughter of a Nāgā , to whom a son named Lutsa Tagpo Woechan was born. 
Lutsa and a Mon lady, Tsomo Gyal were married and their single son was born on the treeline, thus he was given that name Yahpang Kyes i.e. “Born at the divide between slate and grass” i.e. on the tree line of a mountain. The significance of this is that according to the Tibetan conception of cosmology, the gods live in the heights of the mountains above the tree line, while human beings live below the treeline. 
The Khon in the Tibetan Imperial Period:
Konchog Lhundrup continues his account:
Then having slain the Srinpo named Kyareng Khragmey and
having stolen the wife,  Yahdrum Silima
he married her. 
They had a son named Khonpar Kye.
The son of he [Khonpar Kye] and a Lady of the Tsan, Chambu Dron
was handsome and smart, rare in the human lands, 
named Khonpa Jegung Tag,
he was known as Khonton Palpoche, who went to Nyantse.
Yahpang was engaged in a fight with a Srinpo named Kyareng Khragmed, and having slain this Srinpo, married his wife. Because their boy was born as the outcome of a feud between the gods [lha] and demons [srin po], the boy was named “Born in a Feud”, “Khon par kyes”, and this is given as the origin of the clan name of the Khon. 
Khonpar Kye, the offspring of gods, humans and demons, married a lady of a type of a lesser Tibetan god, the Tsan, called Chambu Dron, and their son was known as Khonton Palpoche, i.e. the Khon Teacher who Increases Wealth. He gained his name because after being appointed one of the inner ministers of King Trisrong Detsan’s court, he increased the King’s wealth. 
Khonton Palpoche married Lang Zang Nechung , the sister of a translator named Lang Khampa, and while there are slightly varying accounts as to whether there were two or four sons, most later scholars follow the tradition that there were two sons,  the elder being the great scholar, the Khon Lotsawa, Lu’i Wangpo, and the younger son, Khon Dorje Rinchen.  Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen notes in his Annals of the Khon Lineage [‘khon gyi gdung rabs]:
“Khon Lu’i Wangpo Srungs was the foremost of the seven tested men. His younger brother Khon Dorje Rinchen became a disciple of Master Padmasambhava and became a tantrika.”

It is important to remember that Khyentse Wangpo was a Sakya lama whose primary ritual and literary activity was dedicated to that tradition and while he worked closely with the Kagyu Jamgon Kongtrul and the Nyingma Choggyur Lingpa, neither he nor his colleagues made any effort to merge traditions or initiate a new teaching institution.

http://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setid=2250

Likewise, despite the fact that I have devoted as many years to the study of Dzogchen as I have Lamdre and so on, people still tend to think of me as a Sakyapa and my training grounds me in that school. And when push comes to shove, I still think Sakya Pandita was Tibet's greatest scholar.

It is also interesting to note that at the end of Dilgo Khyentse's life, when he was repairing Samye, he kept on having recurrent visions of Sakya Pandita which led to a Guru Yoga terma featuring Sakya Pandita that has an outer, inner and secret aspect to it.

Yes, and if anyone doubts the profundity and blessings of the teachings of the Sakya school, they should take a lesson from this, since Kongtrul considered Khyentse Wangpo to be a person who had achieved total Buddhahood.

and the father and sons of Ngor,

In truth, no system is perfect because they are only as perfect as the people running them. And quite frankly I see no reason to believe that people will be "better people" under a True Socialist(tm) system, and I suspect that in fact people will be a lot shittier to one another than they are now given the removal of all financial incentives, the only thing left will be social status and hierarchical position.

We are not going to dump capitalism ever, because there have always been markets and opportunities for investment and there always will be markets. What needs to happen is that human beings need to grow up and learn how to restrain their appetites, and manage their markets in such a way that they are not destructive to the planet and other creatures in general. 

When this happens, we can have our cake and eat it too, we can have both a healthy planet, social justice and peace. Socialism, Neo-liberalism, Anarchism, all these political theories are not going to bring us to the point where we have a healthy planet, social justice and peace, because all of options from the left and the right up till now are predicated on violence. Whether it is violent seizure of new markets (Neo -liberalism), violent seizure of capital (Marxian Socialism) or violent disruption of society (Kropotkin style Anarchism), for as long as humans use violence to have their way in the world for that long there will never be peace, never be social justice and there will never be a healthy planet.

From a my point of view as  a Buddhist, your insistence on focusing on external "solutions" (which in my sincere opinion will make things worse) is misguided. In any event, the market is waking up the fact that destroying its own resource base is bad for the market itself. You will see a shift in global capitalism in the next 50 years away from extractive investment towards renewable and reuse investment. This will happen. 

The problem is not markets, nor capital, nor capitalists, communists, socialist, anarchists, fascists, racists, and so on. The problem that we humans are immature, and we need, as a species to grow up.

As I said, the Green Party is the only party which is reconcilable with Buddhist ethics. That or a Buddhist monarchy. Take your pick. 

Anyway, I have no interest in convincing you of anything. You will convince yourself over time as the cognitive dissonance between being a Buddhist and a communist (not to mention the dissonance between social justice and communism) eventually becomes too much to bear.

Anyway, as Naess says, of the three great movements, the peace movement, the social justice movement and the deep ecology movement, one can pick only one to be active in, and I have chosen mine: deep ecology.

It seems you have picked social justice. More power to you.

You don't need to block out the problems of the world. You simply need to realize, as a Buddhist, that they can only be solved through the practice of Dharma. 

And as I have taken great pains to show, If you are a Buddhist, your political affiliation should be consistent with Buddhist values. As far as I can see, the only political party that even comes close to meeting that criteria is the Green Party movement. I have some reservations about the "new left" rhetoric of the US Green Party for example, but nevertheless I cannot associate myself with the Republicans or the Democrats.

An excerpt of an interesting post:

The working classes had their choice of several political movements. There were syndicalist parties, which sought to give workers direct ownership of the firms for which they worked; depending on local taste, that might involve anything from stock ownership programs for employees to cooperatives and other worker-owned enterprises.  Syndicalism was also called corporatism; “corporation” and its cognates in most European languages could refer to any organization with a government charter, including craft guilds and cooperatives.  It was in that sense that Mussolini’s regime, which borrowed some syndicalist elements for its eclectic ideology, liked to refer to itself as a corporatist system. (Those radicals who insist that this meant fascism was a tool of big corporations in the modern sense are thus hopelessly misinformed—a point I’ll cover in much more detail next week.)

There were also socialist parties, which generally sought to place firms under government control; this might amount to anything from government regulation, through stock purchases giving the state a controlling interest in big firms, to outright expropriation and bureaucratic management. Standing apart from the socialist parties were communist parties, which (after 1919) spouted whatever Moscow’s party line happened to be that week; and there were a variety of other, smaller movements—distributism, social credit, and many more—all of which had their own followings and their own proposed answers to the political and economic problems of the day.

The tendency of most of these parties to further the interests of a single class became a matter of concern by the end of the 19th century, and one result was the emergence of parties that pursued, or claimed to pursue, policies of benefit to the entire nation. Many of them tacked the adjective “national” onto their moniker to indicate this shift in orientation. Thus national conservative parties argued that trade barriers and economic policies focused on the agricultural sector would benefit everyone; national liberal parties argued that free trade and colonial expansion was the best option for everyone; national syndicalist parties argued that giving workers a stake in the firms for which they worked would benefit everyone, and so on. There were no national communist parties, because Moscow’s party line didn’t allow it, but there were national bolshevist parties—in Europe between the wars, a bolshevist was someone who supported the Russian Revolution but insisted that Lenin and Stalin had betrayed it in order to impose a personal dictatorship—which argued that violent revolution against the existing order really was in everyone’s best interests.

National socialism was another position along the same lines. National socialist parties argued that business firms should be made subject to government regulation and coordination in order to keep them from acting against the interests of society as a whole, and that the working classes ought to receive a range of government benefits paid for by taxes on corporate income and the well-to-do. Those points were central to the program of the National Socialist German Workers Party from the time it got that name—it was founded as the German Workers Party, and got the rest of the moniker at the urging of a little man with a Charlie Chaplin mustache who became the party’s leader not long after its founding—and those were the policies that the same party enacted when it took power in Germany in 1933.

If those policies sound familiar, dear reader, they should. That’s the other reason why next to nobody outside of specialist historical works mentions national socialism by name: the Western nations that defeated national socialism in Germany promptly adopted its core economic policies, the main source of its mass appeal, to forestall any attempt to revive it in the postwar world.   Strictly speaking, in terms of the meaning that the phrase had before the beginning of the Second World War, national socialism is one of the two standard political flavors of political economy nowadays. The other is liberalism, and it’s another irony of history that in the United States, the party that hates the word “liberal” is a picture-perfect example of a liberal party, as that term was understood back in the day.

Now of course when people think of the National Socialist German Workers Party nowadays, they don’t think of government regulation of industry and free vacations for factory workers, even though those were significant factors in German public life after 1933.  They think of such other habits of Hitler’s regime as declaring war on most of the world, slaughtering political opponents en masse, and exterminating whole ethnic groups. Those are realities, and they need to be recalled.  It’s crucial, though, to remember that when Germany’s National Socialists were out there canvassing for votes in the years before 1933, they weren’t marching proudly behind banners saying VOTE FOR HITLER SO FIFTY MILLION WILL DIE!  When those same National Socialists trotted out their antisemitic rhetoric, for that matter, they weren’t saying anything the average German found offensive or even unusual; to borrow a highly useful German word, antisemitism in those days was salonfähig, “the kind of thing you can bring into the living room.” (To be fair, it was just as socially acceptable in England, the United States, and the rest of the western world at that same time.)

When bliss and suffering are contrasted, there is a link. Anyway, you are free to disagree, but when I read those lines I have a very different take on them that do you.

I guess my point is "So what?" My rejoinder to that is "What is the use of primordial Buddhahood if even your coarse obscurations have not been reduced." Some people seem to think that obscurations are not a problem once you become a Dzogchen practitioner. The more realistic Dzogchen perspective is found in The String of Pearls

As such, the three realms are
the five aggregates, the five sense organs, 
the five limbs, the five functional organs, 
the five objects, the five afflictions,
the five thoughts, the five minds, the five concepts,
the apprehended objects and apprehending subjects established as samsara [… ]
Caught in the aggregates, sense gates and the sense elements, 
the apprehended object and apprehending subject,
samara itself persists for a long while.
One is placed in the dungeon of name and matter
in the castle of the three realms,
tortured with the barbs of ignorance and so on, 
oppressed by the thick darkness of samsara, 
attached to the salty taste of desire, 
bound by the neck with the noose of confusion, 
burned with the hot fire of hatred, 
head covered with pride, 
setting a rendezvous with the mistress of jealousy, 
surrounded by the army of enmity...
tied by the neck with the noose of subject and object, [29b]
stuck in the mud of successive traces
and handcuffed with the ripening of karma.
Having been joined with the ripening of karma, 
one takes bodies good and bad, 
one after another like a water wheel,
born into each individual class.
Having crossed at the ford of self-grasping, 
one sinks into the ocean of suffering
and one is caught by the heart on the hook of the three lowers realms.
One is bound by oneself; the afflictions are the enemy. 
The body of a hell being appears as fire or water.
Pretas are frightened and intimidated.
There is a fog-like appearance for animals.
The aggregates, sense gates and sense elements
of humans appear as the five elements,
and also happiness, suffering and indifference. 
They appear as armor and weapons to asuras 
and desirable qualities for devas. 
Such dualistic appearances,
for example, are like a quickly moving wheel
spinning continuously for a long while. 
As such, diverse appearances
are like seeing a snake from a rope;
that [rope] is not [a snake] but is apprehended as a [snake];
forming as both the outer universe and inhabitants.
If that is investigated, it is a rope.
The universe and inhabitants have always been empty, 
the ultimate endowed with the form of the relative.

No, it is as follows:

Suffering, having always been liberated, is liberated as the vast uniform basis. 
*"Ye grol" is a a contraction of "ye nas grol" and shows a past tense construction, i.e. "having always been"

What Is Deep Ecology?

Deep ecology is so much of a black hole of half-digested, ill-formed, and half-baked ideas that one can easily express utterly vicious notions like Foreman's and still sound like a fiery radical who challenges everything that is anti-ecological in the present realm of ideas. The very words deep ecology, in fact, clue is into the fact that we are not dealing with a body of clear ideas but with a bottomless pit in which vague notions and moods of all kinds can be such into the depths of an ideological toxic dump.

Naess' position is a little different. First he questions the usefulness of the term "biocentric", "ecocentric" and so on:

Supporters of the deep ecology movement like to say that they support ecocentrism, not anthropocentrism, and Spinoza certainly offers high-level premises for what has sometimes been labeled biocentric or ecocentric egalitarianism. I think these Latin or Greek terms are useless in serious discussions, but they may be helpful in offering some vague idea of a kind of basic attitude. Spinoza tried something immensely difficult, namely, to articulate with some preciseness certain basic attitudes.

He continues a bit later by saying:

It is characteristic of the deep ecology movement that great efforts at conservation are argued not only as something good and profitable for human beings, but also as something valuable for what is intended to be conserved. It is worthy of conservation, independently of any narrow human interests. This is often called the nonanthropocentric or biocentric or ecocentric view. Nevertheless, in the current social and political milieu, success in conservation efforts depends heavily on arguments that do stress narrowly human interests, especially the requirements of human health. The supporters of the deep ecology movement combine such arguments with those that are independent of narrow human interests.11 It is essential that “experts” and others who influence policies agree about this combination and that the public be made aware that basically there is agreement. Otherwise, the public is deceived.

Naess, Arne (2009-05-01). The Ecology of Wisdom: Writings by Arne Naess (p. 303). Counterpoint. Kindle Edition. 

This why why "hard" ecocentrism cannot be construed even remotely as deep ecology. Anyway, Bookchin claimed that Earth First! had converted to social ecology as it turned leftwing.

With all due respect, I do not misunderstand the Vima Nyinthig. The Vima Nyinthig passage in question is extremely clear and is repeated in more than one place. So no, it is not possible that I misunderstand the meaning of the passage in question.

For example, in the Zangs Yig Can, Vimala writes:

What is that “vidyā?” 
Vidyā with knowledge obscurations is knowing and lucid. 

Here it is clearly stated that Vidyā can possess obscurations of knowledge. 

And:

1) Characteristic is called “the vidyā which designates general phenomena and just its own names.” Its action is just-that-itself being a clear non-conceptual awareness, which is polluted by many cognitions. 
2) Appropriating the basis*: when all cognitions are created when abiding in one’s body, and existing within its own clarity; this is called “the unripe vidyā.”
*basis here refers to the body.

There are three more:

the vidyā present in the basis 
the vidyā of insight 
the vidyā of tögal 


He concludes:

Are those vidyā’ the same, or are they different? 
There is nothing other than a single essence. 

Therefore, vidyā has different modes depending on whether or not you have received instruction or not. The essence of the vidyā does not change. But the context of how it is understood changes depending on whether you are on the path or not. This is why it is termed "contaminated by many cognitions", and so on.

As pointed out, the architects and theorists of deep ecology do not consider Earth First! to be an expression of deep ecology. As for direct action, Naess was a direct action kind of person. He blocked access to a dam site for twenty years. 

There are certain criteria that render one's view as "deep ecological", and lacking those, one cannot describe oneself as a deep ecologist no matter how ecocentric one's views may be. That is, the basis of one's philosophy must lead inevitably to the platform of deep ecology. It can be generated by different value systems such Buddhist, Christian or Philosophical values. The "deep" in deep ecology is a gloss for "nondual". When other systems are described as shallow, it means that they stem from a dualistic perspective of the world that does not take into consideration the intrinsic non-duality which underlies dependent origination. While not formally a Mahāyāna Buddhist himself, he was a nondualist, and Naess draws upon the two truth theory as well as the tathāgatagarbha theory as he understood them, but he is educated enough to understand that there are Christians nondualisms, Islamic nondualisms and so on. He pretty much clearly states that if your ultimate philosophy is not nondualist, then you will have a hard time arriving at a deep ecology platform. 


Ideally it works like this:

One's ultimate premise forms the basis. This is termed level one. Upon that one builds one's platform principles, one's view, i.e. level two. Upon that, one establishes one's policies, one's meditation, if you will, level three; and finally, one engages in practical actions, one's conduct, i.e. level four. 

The way he frames this for himself is as follows, his ecosophy:

(N = norm; H=hypothesis, exclamation points represent a value norm)
N1: Self-realization!
H1: The higher the Self-realization attained by anyone, the broader and deeper the identification with others.
H2: The higher the level of Self-realization attained by anyone, the more its further increase depends upon the Self-realization of others.
H3: Complete Self-realization of anyone depends on that of all.
N2: Self-realization for all living beings!

He then offers the following for the environment:

H4: Diversity of life increases Self-realization potentials.
N3: Diversity of Life!
H5: Complexity of life increases Self-realization potentials.
N4: Complexity!
H6: Life resources of the Earth are limited.
H7: Symbiosis maximizes Self-realization potentials under conditions of limited resources.
N5: Symbiosis!

My ecosophy would, and does, run something like the following:

N1 Tathagātagarbha!
H1 All sentients beings are innately buddhas.
H2 The highest goal in life to help all sentient beings achieve that buddhahood.
N2 Bodhicitta!
H3 The way help all sentient beings achieve buddhahood is the bodhisattva path
N3 Bodhisattva!

And so on. 

The problem with Foreman's platform is that it excludes humans and is overly biocentric, it is therefore shallow as it is not grounded in nondualist philosophy.

I told you already, I learned an ancient medical tradition, which does not rely on industrial medicine and will survive industrial civilization should it fail, and spent more than five years of my life doing so.

I studied this form of medicine as a direct outgrowth of my longstanding commitment to the principles of deep ecology as articulated by its founder, Arne Naess. 

My commitment to deep ecology does not suggest that my approach is the only approach, as Naess said "The front is long", meaning that there is room for much diversity of thought in the ecological community. But while social ecology, ecofeminism and so on have useful things to say about social justice issues, etc., their approach is "shallow", meaning ultimately anthropocentric, and not deep. I also think the deep green resistance approach is shallow, and not deep because of their trenchant misanthropy. We can say that any ecological movement based on misanthropy is shallow. 

Another point of Naess is that the blue/red political axis is irrelevant to deep ecology itself:

Now a short note on three great contemporary world-wide movements which call for grassroot activism.
The three movements are: the peace movement, the oldest and at present remarkably dormant. But if military expenditures are not rapidly decreasing from about 900 billion dollars a year, I expect it will revive. Then there are many movements I put together under the name 'the social justice movement'. It includes the feminist movement and part of the social ecology movement. As the third movement, one might perhaps also use the more vague term, radical environmentalism because to use the specific terminology of deep ecology will sooner or later elicit boredom and aggression. But the name 'radical environmentalism' smacks of the old metaphor suggesting humanity surrounded by something outside, the so-called environment of humans; it does not start with ecological concepts. And in the US it will take a long time before radicalism loses its connection with the political red-blue axis which now is irrelevant.

http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.ph ... ew/432/708

Some people disagree with Naess. But fundamental to deep ecology is that one develops one's own ecosophy. Each person's ecosophy is personal. To understand this, you have to understand the apron diagram he and Sessions came up. He notes:

One main point in deep ecology is the deep argumentation, that is, argumentation from ultimate (philosophical, religious) premises, but there is room for very different sets of such premises.

Naess, Arne (2009-05-01). The Ecology of Wisdom: Writings by Arne Naess (p. 108). Counterpoint. Kindle Edition. 

And:

The platform principles of the deep ecology movement can be grounded for individual supporters in a religion or an ultimate philosophy. There is a great diversity of religions and philosophies from which people can support these principles. In a loose sense, the deep ecology movement can be said to be derived from these kinds of fundamentals. The situation reminds us that a set of very similar or even identical conclusions may be drawn from divergent premises. The platform can be the same, even though the fundamental premises differ. One must avoid looking for one definite philosophy or religion among all the supporters of the deep ecology movement. Fortunately, there is a rich manifold of fundamental views compatible with the platform of the deep ecology movement. Supporters live in different cultures and have different religions. Furthermore, there is a plethora of consequences derived from the platform because of these and other differences.

Naess, Arne (2009-05-01). The Ecology of Wisdom: Writings by Arne Naess (pp. 114-115). Counterpoint. Kindle Edition. 

And:

Personally, I favor the kind of powerful premises represented in Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and Hebrew philosophy, as well as in Western philosophy—namely, those having as a slogan the so-called ultimate unity of all life. They do not hide the fact that big fish eat small ones, but stress the profound interdependence, the functional unity, of such a biospheric magnitude that nonviolence, mutual respect, and feelings of identification are always potentially there, even between the predator and its so-called victim. In many cultures, identification is not limited merely to other living things but also to the mineral world, which helps us conceive of ourselves as genuine surface fragments of our planet, fragments capable of somehow experiencing the existence of all other fragments: a microcosm of the macrocosm.

Naess, Arne (2009-05-01). The Ecology of Wisdom: Writings by Arne Naess (pp. 131-132). Counterpoint. Kindle Edition. 


So, I am a Buddhist practitioner with a long standing (27 years) commitment to a deep ecological outlook, and this is what informs my political outlook.

One can espouse an ecocentric view without it being consistent with ecosophy, aka deep ecology. 

On David Foreman's supposed "deep ecology", George Sessions write:

Lee is adamant that Deep Ecology has been the philosophy of Earth First! although she admits that most EF!ers read very little Deep Ecology philosophy, and that specific mention of Deep Ecology did not appear in the E.F! Journal until mid-1984 (pp.18, 37, 57). It is rather painful to read about some of the positions taken by the Foreman faction in the E.F! Journal: for example, Foreman arguing that even a nuclear war would not be that damaging to the Earth and would hasten the end of industrial society, his remark that "wilderness is the real world" (it's all real! - it's just that the rest has to be restored and reinhabited) and his remarks elsewhere that we should "allow Ethiopians to starve"; Christopher Manes suggesting that one solution to overpopulation would be to dismantle the medical technology designed to save lives, and of AIDS as Nature's solution to overpopulation; and Reed Noss writing of genetic "deep ecology elite" as a "chosen people" out to save the Earth (pp. 64, 68, 83-84, 92-3,101-3). [Paul Shepard and E.O. Wilson have claimed that all humans have the "wilderness gene" but that it is suppressed, especially in modern urban people.] Since many, but not all, of these articles appeared under various pseudonyms, this leads to speculation as to whether Foreman, Manes, and the others were merely exercising their rights as individuals to the free expression of radical and shocking (and perhaps misanthropic) ideas; whether these ideas were meant to express the philosophy of Earth First!; and/or whether they thought they were expounding ideas which were the natural outcome of Deep Ecology philosophy. If the latter, they were radically mistaken in their understanding of Deep Ecology philosophy as espoused by Naess and other Deep Ecology movement theorists.

Lee accurately points out that Edward Abbey's ideas, expressed mainly through his novels (and his association with Earth First!) "had inspired the founding of the movement" (p. 126). Given that "since Earth First!'s inception, Dave Foreman had served as its prophet and leader" (p. 105) together with Foreman's idolizing of Abbey, the predominant philosophy and ideology of Earth First! throughout the 1980's is probably best described, not as Deep Ecology, but rather as an idiosyncratic, somewhat misanthropic Abbey/Foreman version of ecocentrism, coupled with a monkey wrenching/"rednecks for wilderness" image that some people found offensive.

http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.ph ... ew/232/333

Again, if it is not consistent with Naess or Sessions and Duvall, it is not deep ecology. 

Indeed, deep ecology has been critiqued as a conservative and even a right wing movement: 

Devall and Sessions do not question the distribution or ownership of land. Their first principle of land management is to "encourage agencies, legislators, property owners and managers" to flow with natural processes. 'Deep Ecology: Living as if Nature Mattered' p.145

Deep ecology is not concerned with who should own land or whether land ownership is legitimate, but only with how it is treated.

At best deep ecology is apolitical, and though it claims to be beyond such distinctions, many feel deep ecology tends towards a right-wing perspective. Social ecologists and ecofeminists agree that not enough analysis is done by deep ecology of the social forces at work in the destruction of the biosphere.

It means that ordinary people can only see nirmanakāyas. Practitioners of specific realization on the path can see the sambhogakāya. The level at which they can see the sambhogakāya varies depending on the path. The Sambhogakāya images one sees on the four visions are not the actual sambhogakāya since those images are inert. However, at a certain point in the path of the four visions one can see the actual sambhogakāya. The sight of the dharmakāya only occurs at the end of the four visions, i.e. the exhaustion of dharmatā.

In this respect then, Dzogchen is no more non-gradual than any other Buddhist path.

It's not a problem at all. If one remains grounded in the thought of Naess, deep ecology and a market economy are not incompatible. He writes:

The deep ecology movement has in common with blue [right wing] politics its aversion to bureaucracy, its emphasis on personal enterprise and initiative, and a reluctance to take certain green utopias too seriously. With the old politics of the Western European kind the common ground is more obvious, the fight on the side of the underdog, solidarity with the underprivileged or the powerless, extension of care.

And:

Rich people who work in the world of business, but are supporters of the deep ecology movement, ask in all seriousness whether the green utopian societies must look so dreary. Why portray a society which seemingly needs no big entrepreneurs, only organic farmers,modest artists, and mild naturalists. A capitalist society is in a certain sense a rather wild society. We need some degree of wildness, but not exactly the capitalist sort. The usual utopian green societies seem so sober and tame. We shall need enthusiasts of the extravagant, the luxuriant, the big. But they must not dominate.
http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.ph ... ew/432/708

So you see, Naess's thinking was not exactly pro-capitialist and not exactly anti-capitalist.

Yes, if some country wishes to try nationalization of industries and banks through entirely peaceful means, Buddhists living in that country can of course be on either side of that decision, but if the decision is made to nationalize, they have nothing more really to say about it. 

But of some citizens of a country decide to enact a violent revolution and seize banks and industries through force, Buddhist ethics would describe that as theft and no Buddhist should participate in that revolution. Not only this, it will not be successful, because those citizens would not be observing not only the seven conditions upon which a successful country is based upon, but not even one.

I never once said that Buddhists could not resist injustice. We can, but we need to do so with the principle of non-violence foremost in our minds and the understanding that as limited common people without the benefit of realization we really do not have the capacity to predict the outcomes of violent upheavals. In other words, when Buddhists enter into a social struggle they may be ready to die for their cause, but they have a higher ethical obligation to strive to preserve the live's of their "enemies" at all costs, even at the cost of their own lives.

One can defend the ecosystem from catastrophe, but one must do so lawfully and non-violently. I have no problem with corporations such as BP being stripped of their property, legally, when they prove to be negligent in the conduct of their business. But I do not think it is right, or even ecologically sane, to blow up oil pipelines, transmission lines, and so on. 

For example, look at all the harm people do like releasing animals from labs. This is just plain stupid as well as dangerous. This does not demonstrate any ecological awareness at all. 

To Illustrate how support of monkey wrenching is inconsistent with Deep Ecology, we see that Naess writes:

In many Western countries, environmental struggle involves direct actions and violent confrontation. The norms of nonviolent group conflict as worked out by Gandhi and others exclude violence not only against the opponents, but also against their machinery and other equipment that,  from a direct, causal point of view, destroy life and life conditions on a vast scale. The norms against so-called sabotage involving such equipment are based on deep attitudes that express themselves in cultural phenomena such as inochi and kuyo.

Naess, Arne (2009-05-01). The Ecology of Wisdom: Writings by Arne Naess (p. 204). Counterpoint. Kindle Edition. 

As you can see, we Deep Ecologists do not support in any way violence against either people or property. We Buddhists should not either, unless the special conditions of clairvoyance that I mentioned manifest in ourselves, as in the case of the Bodhisattva when he was a sea captain.

Since the vows do not suppose one's mind can be directly controlled, and since of the four verbal non-virtues, lying is the worst, and because Buddha compassionately understood that people were going to yell, spread calumny and gossip he did not turn those into precepts. He forbad the three non-virtues of the body. These ten non-virtues are what drive rebirth into lower realms; their avoidance results in birth in higher realms.

Here is the critical point that everyone over looks. 

All Mahāyāna paths whether sūtra or tantra, have one thing in common: realization of the three kāyas. Each path works first at the nirmanakāya level, i.e. at first that's all you can see; then the sambhogakāya level, and finally, at the end one can see the dharmakāya personally, then one is a Buddha. 

This is the same whether you are practicing the six perfections, the two stages, or trekchöd and thogal. The only difference is the amount of time it takes, and the methodology used. 

Even in sūtra the obscurations are not regarded as something real which need to be abandoned. The Abhisamayālaṃkāra states:
The wisdom of the exhaustion and non-arising
of taints is called “the awakened state”.

But labor _is_ a commodity, on this Marx agrees with Adam Smith. Labor is the "Wealth of Nations", but even the labor theory of value is obsolete. 

These days many economists use quantified marginal utility. 

In economics, the marginal utility of a good or service is the gain from an increase or loss from a decrease in the consumption of that good or service. Economists sometimes speak of a law of diminishing marginal utility, meaning that the first unit of consumption of a good or service yields more utility than the second and subsequent units, with a continuing reduction for greater amounts[clarification needed]. The marginal decision rule states that a good or service should be consumed at a quantity at which the marginal utility is equal to the marginal cost.[1]
The concept of marginal utility played a crucial role in the marginal revolution of the late 19th century, and led to the replacement of the labor theory of value by neoclassical value theory in which the relative prices of goods and services are simultaneously determined by marginal rates of substitution in consumption and marginal rates of transformation in production, which are equal in economic equilibrium.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility

This applies equally to labor as much as anything else. So for example, a cotton picker's labor has a marginal utility higher when there are no cotton machines to pick cotton. When cotton machines to pick cotton are introduced, that person's labor as a cotton picker becomes 0 value and they are forced to find other work. However, if a government decides, for whatever reason, that value of cotton pickers is innate, they can elect to bar cotton pickers, and thus the marginal utility of a cotton picker remains high for as long as cotton is wanted. 

The labor theory of value however would declare that a person's labor is equal to what they can produce, and in Marxist terms, they ought to be rewarded one hundred percent for that. Of course that is not how it works in practice, because skilled workers can produce much more value than unskilled workers, for example, in the translation of Tibetan texts. The only way it could work in Marxist terms is to abolish markets and declare all labor is equal in value as well as all commodities produced by that labor, which is of course total nonsense. A chair made in half an hour is in no way comparable to a chair made by a fine craftsmen in 80 hours.

This still refers to the imagined nature viz: reification persons and things is the imagined nature, the absence of subject and object which produces the imagined is the dependent nature, the absence of existence and non-existence of the imagined nature in the dependent nature is the perfected nature. All of these three terms hinge on the imagined nature.

But the Buddhist view is not actually a verbal construct, and for that matter neither is Buddhist awakening. 

For example, one needs only to understand the dependent nature of afflictions to become a stream entrant and so on, becoming free of the fetters. This does not require elaborate philosophy. It merely requires confidence in the teaching of dependent origination and the four truths of nobles. 

Likewise, for the realization of emptiness on the path of seeing, one simple has to reflect on the absence of extremes (for a very long time, albeit), as Shantideva states, "when neither an entity or a non-entity remain before the mind, at the time, the mind is pacified", and this too is an experiential view. 

In the case of Vajrayāna, the view, such as it is, is based on the experience of the example wisdom at the time of direct introduction or the third and fourth empowerments. Unfettered equipoise in the mind essence, or "ordinary awareness" is the view of Vajrayāna. 

So this is why your illustration is irrelevant to Buddhadharma, and why Buddhadharma does not merit inclusion amongst "the blind men".

Even Karl Brunholz admits that the three natures as presented by the Tibetan gzhan stong pas does not reflect their use by the original Yogacara masters. The former use what he describes as the type two schema of the three natures, while he fully admits that the latter use a type one schema. The problem arises because the Tibetan gzhan stong pas clearly claim that they are representing the thought of the original Yogacara masters, Maitreyanatha, Asanga and Vasubandhu when in fact they clearly are not, and thus Tsongkhapa, Gorampa, and so on, a whole host of Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma and Gelug scholars can take them to task for misapplication of this doctrine. 

The three natures doctrine is entirely irrelevant to the tathāgatagarbha teachings. It is wholly absent in the ten so called "tathāgatagarbha" sutras as well as the Uttaratantra. The three natures doctrine was grafted onto the tathāgatagarbha doctrine in Tibet because the tathāgatagarbha sūtras are considered "third turning" and the subject of the three natures is covered extensively in the Saṃdhinirmocana sutra, a sūtra of the Yogacara class, which provides us with the locus classicus of the three turnings, but it is so vague as to what is meant by this as to be rather useless, though much stock is placed in it by the gzhan stong pas. 

Longchenpa is a perfectly good example of an author who considers the tathāgatagarbha sūtras to be definitive without mixing in the Yogacara three own natures. He also considers Prasangika to be the definitive sutra view. 

My problem with the gzhan stong pas is that they do not heed the valid objections of their opponents, and as far as I can tell adhere to their tenet system out of sheer stubbornness rather than reason.

My objection to gzhan stong therefore is primarily an objection to their sloppiness of scholarship.

No, the dependent nature is defined as conditioned. The Mahāyānasaṃgraha states:
Why? If it is asked what is the dependent, since it arises from the seeds of one's traces, given that is the case, it is the conditioned dependent.
Here, one can clearly see the other dependent is the ālayavijñāna. 
Then he goes on: 
If it is held that whatever appears does not exist in that way, for what reason will the dependent nature not become the total non-existence of everything? If it is asked, if that [dependent nature] does not exist, how will the non-existent perfected nature not become the non-existence of everything? Affliction and purification are perceptible. Therefore, everything is not non-existent. A verse for that:
If the dependent and the perfected
do not exist in every aspect,
affliction and purification
can never exist at all. 

So you see, there is an assertion here by Asanga that the ālayavijñāna which is the basis of purification must be an existent in order that the perfected nature can exist; but since one is conditioned and the other is unconditioned, this Yogacara view suffers from a crucial internal contradiction.

The gzhan stong pas seek to escape this contradiction by mapping the three natures over the two truths. But this mapping is not justified in the  Indian texts and in reality harms both systems. So you wind up with a system that is kind of like a tole, a sterile hybrid between a yak and cow, being neither.

It is not a matter of partiality. The problem with the three natures is that they contain an internal contradiction: viz since the perfected nature is merely the absence of the imagined in the dependent, one must explain how the dependent, which is conditioned, becomes the perfected, which is unconditioned.

The Tibetan system of treating the perfected nature as empty of the dependent and the imagined indeed is based on some very late Indian scholars, but it is not justified in the works of Maitreyanatha, Asanga or Vasubandhu.

It is not gzhan stong. Gzhan stong requires the convoluted misapplication of the three natures to the two truths. In other words, gzhan stong is at worst, a deformed Madhyamaka; at best it is a transitional view between false aspectarian Yogacara and Madhyamaka. 

Nothing stated above is inconsistent with the definitive sutras of the second turning of the wheel. The Āryāṣṭasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā:

Kauśika, given that is so, the Tathāgata is not named tathāgata because he attained his own physical body [ātmabhāvaśarīra], but it is because he attained omniscient wisdom that the Tathāgata is called the tathāgata.

Kauśika, whatever the omniscience of the tathāgata arhat samyakbuddha is, this comes from prajñāpāramitā. 

The attainment of the Tathāgatas own physical body arises from prajñāpāramitā and skill in means, and is the support for omniscient wisdom. Relying on such a support [as the prajñāpāramitā] will generate omniscient wisdom, and will also generate the body of a buddha, and will also generate the dharmakāya, and will also generate the sangha.

Thus if one wants to realize the dharmakāya and omniscience, one must rely on prajñāpāramitā. 

Also here is a clear usage of "atman" which does not refer to the self, but rather is being used as a reflexive noun.

What the dharmakāya is not empty of is omniscience. All of its qualities are simply qualities of omniscience, and that is all. The dharmakāya is unconditioned, it has neither form or shape, so those are the only qualities it could be said to possess. It has two aspects, the emptiness aspect and the luminous aspect. Understood in this way, one understands the real meaning of purity, bliss, self, and permanence. 

It is pure because it is empty, it is bliss because it is free from suffering, it is "self" because omniscience transcends both self and non-self and it is permanent because it not subject to decay.

The reason why only buddhas can see tathāgatagarbha is the same reason only buddhas can see the dharmakāya.

Dear Sonam:

From a Buddhist point of view, all of these utopian visions require one thing in common, i.e., that all people are free from the three afflictions, or at least able to keep them in check. We presently live in the era of the five degenerations where afflictions are rampant. What are the five? 

The degeneration of lifespan
The degeneration of the seasons (climate)
The degeneration of afflictions
The degeneration of view (i.e. increased reliance on materialism, like Marxism, anarcho-capitalism, etc.)
The degeneration of decline (declining health, intelligence, and so on)

For this reason I place no hope in any utopian schemes. The present economic system remains the one most accessible of improvement and tuning. Socialism, as envisioned by the 19th and early 20th century firebrands, has proven to be an utter failure. While capitalism is spiritually bereft as well, at least it is not authoritarian or totalitarian. Yes, you may be free to starve under this economic system, but at least you are free.

At present our manufacturing capacity as well as our agricultural capacity is completely dependent on fossil fuels, not to mention the grids in various countries. Until someone discovers another relatively inexpensive source of consumable energy that does not itself depend on fossil fuels, at present world population levels it is irresponsible to start eliminating the use of fossil fules by fiat. Is eliminating their use a desiderata? Certainly. Does our world ecology demand it, certainly. Can we do so immediately and globally? No, our addiction to fossil fuels is so deep, that it is impossible for us to withdraw from fossil fuels at this time. Every part of global trade, manufacture and agriculture extensively uses fossil fuels.

I simply do not agree that this is so. Of course employers have the option, if they choose, of profit sharing. But it is not a right that employees have, it is a privilege granted by the employer. 

You cannot have a market economy under your version of Socialism where people are free to buy and sell as they wish, whatever they wish, so I do not support it. People are not free under your version of Socialism, they must do the bidding of committees and party functionaries. 

I also do not agree with anarcho-capitalists, this is another extreme vision. 

Markets requires sound regulations in order to keep them stable and functioning. Among those regulations may indeed be wage guarantees so that people without skills may at least make a living wage, but no more than that. We have seen in this country what happens to industries when the unions get a stranglehold on them: they become moribund, eventually sicken and then die. On the other hand, in the beginning unions were important in setting many workplace precedents, and I think that unions have positive roles to play as well. It is a delicate balance. 

The fact of the matter is that my thinking comes from analyzing how I feel in these various situations.

 Just wanted to clarify that Ganor Rinpoche is Nyingma and not part of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage. He is a Terton that has revealed a number of practices including a Vajrakilaya cycle. I do not know if he revealed an Achi Terma, but he did have a vision of Achi Chokyi Drolma that revealed to him that Lho Ontul Rinpoche's son, Ratna Rinpoche, was the Quality emanation of the Drikung Terton Lho Nuden Dorje. Historically Lho Ontul Rinpoche entered the Drikung Kagyu lineage in the 19th century as the older brother of Lho Nuden Dorje. 

Achi Chkyi Drolma is also practiced in other lineages such as in Dujom Rinpoche's tradition. At the Khenpo brothers center in New York State her image can be seen. One of her emanations is said to be  Yeshe Tsogyal. The late  Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok, when visiting Terdrom where the Yangzab Terma was revealed, had a vision of a wrathful form of Achi Chokyi Drolma and composed a praise to her. 

Once H.E. Garchen Rinpoche gave me the transmission for the 108 Tara's and stopped at Achi Chokyi Drolma to let me know she was also an emanation of Tara before he finished the transmission. I would be interested to know if Ganor Rinpoche has revealed any Achi termas. 

Other Achi Termas were revealed by the Drikung Terton Osel Dorje. Also there is a very special Pure Vision practice of Achi Chokyi Drolma that was received by the previous H.E. Tritasab Rinpoche. This is an amazing practice that was brought out of Tibet by Lho Ontul Rinpoche in the 80's, who then gave the transmission to H.H. Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche. In 2004, at the Monkey Year teachings, the most current incarnation of H.E. Tritsab Rinpoche gave the transmission for this practice. In this practice, Achi Chokyi Drolma can be practiced as the Lama, Yidam, Dakini, or protector. It is supplemented by many different useful concise practices. The previous H.E. Tritab Rinpoche revealed this while he was in a Chinese Labor Camp in the late sixties. It is very much a practice for these times.

It means that according to Madhyamaka there are two so called ultimates, one is nominal, the other is the direct perception of emptiness. 

But from a Dzogchen point of view, since all relative truths are objects of false cognitions, even the cognition of the nominal ultimate is faulty. The only thing that is true is the cognition of dharmatā. That most certainly requires some kind of direct introduction which is lacking in Sutra teachings. The main advantage to Vajrayāna teachings is that dharmatā or the example wisdom, is introduced during the time of empowerment. In the case of gsar ma, it is the introduction of bliss and emptiness at the time of the third and fourth empowerments; in the case of the Dzogchen it is the introduction of the potentiality of vidyā during anyone of the four styles of empowerment, elaborate, unelaborate and so on.

Self-originated wisdom, rang byung ye shes, svayambhujñāna, the three kāyas, everything thing else is false, thus there is no basis for establishing an ultimate since the relative is merely a delusion (and the ultimate of Madhyamaka can only be established relatively). Dzogchen texts frequently state there is only one stage, buddhahood.

Point 3) If I owe you a hundred dollars, I have to be nice to you. If I owe you a 100,000,000 million, you have to be nice to me. 



US foreign debt is 5.6 trillion as of 1/1/13. 

If you look, you will see most of debt is held by Other (29.3%) China (22.5%) and Japan (19.0%), in descending order. 

China and Japan are heavily dependent on us to buy their imports. So, I don't really see this as a problem for us. The total external debt however is preposterous: 17,344,649,888,998 i.e. 17.3 trillion dollars. Followed by the UK and 10 trillion, followed by France and Germany, and so on. However, of the US debt, 12 trillion is held by Americans. So we are in no danger. 

Point 4) The Affordable Care Act is meant to address that through the market. I think it is a bad idea, personally, and support Universal Health Care, but it seems the majority of Americans still cling to the illusion of market choices where their health care is concerned rather than understanding that health care, even if private, should be a regulated monopoly like any other utility.

Well, I've been to a lot of places in the world, Africa, Asia, India, Europe, etc., and while they are all have their points, and I have enjoyed being in them all, the US offers a basic political stability and natural wealth that is hard to beat in most other places in the world. I live in one of the largest contiguous forests in the world, i.e., 25 million acres of trees from Pennsylvania to Maine. Where I live it is largely eco-conscience, we have a strong tradition of social welfare, at a local level we practice direct democracy (Town meetings, invented in the Massachusetts Bay Colony), it is water wealthy because of the forests, etc. Also the Northwest, Oregon and Washington, have a culture that mirrors ours because they were initially settled by New Englanders. There are physical advantages to living here in the Northeast that you can't really find elsewhere because of the wealth of our economy (even when it is in arrears), natural resources and so on. 

India, Africa and China are eco-disasters waiting to happen for many reasons. Russia, while filled with a lot of trees, is too damn cold. Europe is nice, but restrictive. Latin America is fun, but politically unstable. 

Canada, on the other hand, has many of the advantages of the Unites States as well.

Yes, it appears during the last decade HHDL's thinking about these things has somewhat evolved. Personally, I think what he actually means by "Marxist" is that a state should provide guaranteed minimal welfare for its citizens. This is very consistent, for example, with the recommendations found in the Ratnavali and so on. I think he also recognizes that a free market economy provides opportunities that are not possible in a planned economy. Free markets spur more than mere exchange of goods. They also spur creativity, for better or for worse.

My perspective is that in an ideal society there is a balance struck between a market economy, providing minimum support needed for citizens (health care, emergency relief, infrastructure) and the ecosystem, with the ecosystem being a dominant consideration. In other words, if a particular market has a particularly negative impact on the ecosystem, it should be be tightly regulated, etc.

Yes, and this is a problem. Buddha could not have been a capitalist, but he clearly approved of markets and trade; he could not have been a socialist, but he clearly set up temporary propertyless communes that eventually became permanent. He was not by any means an anarchist, since hierarchy clearly established in his sangha with monks, novices and lay people. And he was not an authoritarian since he recommended humanitarian values to rulers. 

Like I said in the (currently locked) "Was Nagarjuna a misogynist?" thread, it might well be that a truly Dharmic social/political reality may not satisfy liberal values at all.  Who knows?[/quote]

We can only find out by trying to live with others according to our Buddhist values and see how they play out politically. These online forums are in fact an example of just that.

Capitalism was a term coined by Marx. Prior to Marx, no one ever called themselves a "Capitalist". After Marx, people used the term to describe the economic system we still have at present. But it is not and never was a coherent political system.  People started calling Smith's thought "Capitalism" because it was his economic thought and policy suggestions in Wealth of Nations that Marx was largely critiquing. 

An argument may be made that political and economic systems are mutually dependent, and it is certainly true that as the US is a product of the Scottish Enlightenment, its political values upon which our style of democracy was founded include such items as ownership of private property, "free" markets, etc. These are enshrined in the BIll of Rights, the fifth amendment of which reads:

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

This is of course why Americans by and large are hostile to socialism and communism, because both systems suggest that people do not have a right to private property. 
 But this we are having this discussion in another thread.

Correct view in Vajrayāna arises from the empowerment. This is the reason why in Lamdre, for example, one meditates the view only _after_ having received the cause empowerment where it is introduced in the section of the ālaya cause continuum (tantra) among the three tantras (cause, path and result). 

Despite this, of course one also meditates a sutrayāna view using śamatha and vipaśyāna (supplemented by citations from the Mahāsiddhas) at the time of the vision of experience teachings from among the three visions (impure, experiential and pure). Frankly, despite polemics between Sakya and Kagyu over the issue of sutra mahāmudra, meditating the view here is not so different than sutra mahāmudra save only the name.

I was not really talking so much about the role of leaders in politics, but of course this is an understandable inference. What I am really trying to get at is a means of discovering a Buddhist political sensibility which is informed by Buddha's teachings, but can be applied in how we conduct ourselves in political matters.

For example, the Buddha's original middle way was a path between indulgence and asceticism. So the real question is, "How do we Buddhists walk this path in whatever political situation we find ourselves in". That is what I mean by "MIddle Way Politics". TKfan has the right idea, this is not so much about applying political remedies as a party, but what kind of political choices we make in light of our understanding of the Buddha's teaching, based on our own personal transformation dependent on our being people who live in a "polis", who are part of a "polity". So in that case, Adamantine's question about use of force is not an issue. Obviously a key point of a middle way politic would have to include ahimsa as a guiding principle.

Well, in fact the Yogacara Madhyamaka that Tsongkhapa is referring to is Śantarakṣita's. Śantarakȋta's sole concession to Yogacara was that it was allowable to say that all phenomena are established as mind as a conventional truth. But he never goes into some lengthy analysis via the three natures, which he must therefore regards as being rather clumsy and leading one astray from Madhyamaka. Indeed the three natures theory is the main thing that comes under attack from Madhyamakas. 

When it comes to the three natures theory in Tibet, this is the main thing about the Jonang presentation that Tsongkhapa attacks in his Legs bshad. He asserts their presentation deviates from how it is presented by Asanga and Vasubandhu and that they misuse it.

Or more simply, we can look at texts like the Ratnavali by Nāgārjuna which set out in some detail how kings are to set out social policies. .

The term was coined by Thich Nhat Hahn. You can read his precepts of Engaged Buddhism here. You will particularly like precept 5:

Do not accumulate wealth while millions are hungry. Do not take as the aim of your life fame, profit, wealth, or sensual pleasure. Live simply and share time, energy, and material resources with those who are in need.

Joanna Macy is another person who has written about this quite a bit:

Engaged Buddhism is basically Deep Ecology with a Buddhist perspective.

Conventionally, of course. Then you have to understand that conventions will not bear analysis.

Right, it means that according to UN estimates, word population in 2150 could be as high as 25 trillion, the red line, or as low s 3.5 trillion, the green line. According to the report, the mathematical model favors the low number.

As I said, the repeal of the Glass-Stegal act was a huge mistake. But investment banks have a legitimate role in the economy, just as as "venture" capitalists do (they are really the same thing).

That is the beauty of having different countries, each nation is free to try out its own policies and see how it works out for them. Other nations can see the outcomes and decide to follow suit or not.

It is germane to other issues, but not to my immediate point with SD, i.e., that the British empire was not "overcome" per se by anyone. It "fell apart", because Britain had no stomach nor money to keep armies fielded to control its colonies. 

SD, Canada remains a part of the British Commonwealth and the Queen is the head of state. 

The British relinquished Egypt after WWI because they revolted, etc., but even so, most of the former British Empire remain commonwealth territories, sharing the Queen as their head of state, and what's more, the cultural influences of the Empire are enduring. 

When I say "bequeathed", the areas formerly dominated by the empire came to be dominated by American economic policy and military power, rather than direct colonization. A former colony, we Americans are traditionally allergic to expanding our powers through direct colonization. Our attempts at foreign intervention sadly have wrought far more harm than long term good, as far as I can tell.

Good question, but it is not germane to my point.

I am not advocating a capitalist view. I am pointing out, as I have over and over again, that the only way you can secure your goals is with lethal violence. I do not condone that, I am utterly opposed to it. I do not share your conviction that "workers own the factories in which they work", unless in fact they do, done so properly, legally and with the full protection of the law. I do not support your view again that the wealth of the ultra rich should be seized, because such a seizure itself would involve catastrophic international conflicts, and because such people have the means to simply remove themselves from your reach. In other words, more harm than good would arise from their temporary (seriously, what's forty years?) control of such wealth. So lets say you do give everyone in the world $49,000 [233 trillion / by world population]. How are you planning to do this? Actually you aren't. You are going to completely disrupt the economy and destroy everyone's wealth, just like the Bolsheviks did in Russia. Honestly, on this score, I think you are completely naive. But lets say we did, the same thing would happen all over again; some people, most people will squander their wealth, some people will be better at managing it, and eventually the same disparities that have arisen will just arise again. 

The socialist democracies that Kirt is so fond of are a kind of rapprochement between a moderate (non-marxist) socialist view and the market economy we live in. However, they are only feasible because they are floating in a sea of money. 

I guess the point is, I am not opposed to strict market regulation, it is necessary actually for a whole host of environmental reasons and social reasons. But what I am totally opposed to is the idea that we try to abolish the market economy we have now, because another one, a black one, will just take its place.

Anyway, I really don't think your revolution is ever going to happen anyway. The way global wealth is distributed, you would have to have a revolution in the US first, and that will never happen until we have a poverty crisis. Americans are completely allergic to communism. 

You don't seem to have any idea what the eighteen qualities of a precious human birth are, even though you are British and a Buddhist. You should maximize your precious human birth and practice Dharma, not waste all your time on obsolete political religions.
