Yes, for some people it is hard to see the difference between Chan and Dzogchen. But their approaches are quite different, and for this one has to look to those Tibetan masters who practiced both.

The difference in approach is based on whether you are a Sūtra practitioner or a Secret Mantra practitioner. In some respect, whether you practice sūtra or tantra is a little irrelevant if you are studying with real Dzogchen master. But because Dzogchen is grounded in Secret Mantra, one cannot practice it without a guru, nor without the inconvenient litte thing called "direct introduction," which is absent both in Sūtra in general, and Zen/Chan.

Original mind (gnyug sems, adyācitta), on the other hand, refers to the basic state of a moment of unfabricated clear and empty consciousness. It is also called ordinary consciousness (tha mal gyi shes pa). However, there is no nature of the mind separate from the mind. Sustaining equipoise in unfabricated clear and empty consciousness is what is termed "the view" in Dzogchen, Mahāmudra, Lamdre, etc. This unfabricated clear and empty consciousness is the basis upon which rests the path of Secret Mantra.

What is important is that someone learns what rig pa is. This is why I do not translate the word, why EPK does not translate it anymore, why Adriano Clemente does not translate it, and so on. But if we are going to explain what the word means in English, it clearly means "knowledge" and "knowing", and not awareness.

Awareness (saṃprajāna) is a mental factor (caitta) which is always associated with mindfulness (smṛti). Mental factors arise simultaneously with a mind. There is no other "awareness" spoken of in Buddhadharma.

I disagree about knowledge = awareness. To be conscious is to be aware. Awareness is a quality of consciousness. Knowledge is something else. For example, the consciousness at the time of the basis is certainly aware. However, it is only when it knows it's own appearances are its own state, that we can say that consciousness has rig pa, a state of knowledge. If it fails in this recognition, one's consciousness is still aware of those appearances, but in this case since it does not know those appearances are its own state, that consciousness has ma rig pa instead, a state of ignorance. 

Awareness is present in both rig pa and ma rig pa since knowledge and ignorance are the knowledge and ignorance of a consciousness. According to the definition you provide, awareness cannot be present in ma rig pa, it will be a state of unconsciousness. But even ignorant minds are consciousness and aware. Since awareness is in fact a quality of consciousness, awareness is found states of both knowledge and ignorance.

This is why it is important to separate Dharma language from common parlance.

CTR is referring to series of three polemical texts by Mipham, one of which Hopkins translated as "fundamental mind." Mipham's rendering of gnyug sems in Sanskrit is ādyacitta, which actually means "first," etc. In this text Mipham quotes from the Great Tantra Clarifying The Meaning of Freedom From Proliferation:

In the context of explaining the illustrative examples of that basis, it is said to be  empty and pervasive like space; immaculate like a crystal; unchanging like a vajra; the source of all blessings like a jewel; unimpeded illumination like the heart of the sun and so on. [7/a] It is the opposite of ignorance (avidyā) and inertness, existing as nature of a veridical consciousness, it is knowledge (vidyā). Since it is beyond cause and condition, it is self-originated. Since it does not arise adventitiously, it is the pristine consciousness that has become the nature of the vidyā that has always existed. It is the basis from which all samsara and nirvana appear.

I never make statements about these things without very sound research. Sometimes I do more research and change my mind, but not about this one. 

For those who want to believe I am just an intellectual, this is fine by me. I could care less. 

The fact is that word awareness as a translation of rig pa is plain wrong: no ifs, ands, or buts about it. People continue to use it because of Herbert Guenther's translations. But he was wrong, and that is that.

Yes, that was the challenge you put forth, I merely pointed out that I think Harris has a chauvanistic attitude towards Islam that is not grounded in any real appreciation for the subject of his bia, he says for example:

Muslims everywhere who love freedom must honestly grapple with the challenges that a politicized strand of their religion poses to free societies.

He has make many such statements, and yet nowhere does he show this danger to free societies exists. In fact, ISIS, etc, is only a danger to those societies that have been fractured and damaged as a result of US adventurism into the Middle East and Central Asia. ISIS poses no threat to" Western Civilization(tm)."

Yes, it is certainly true that two centuries of racist policies in Europe have created tension between former colonial powers and workers they imported from North Africa, Pakistan, and so on. But in reality, Europe has been dealing with terrorists of one stripe or another for decades. As far as I am concerned, the rise of neo-fascism is a much more of an existential threat than a bunch of violent sociopaths in Syria and Iraq who have proven they are so despicable the world agrees they should be utterly and completely rubbed out.

Not better, just far more informed about the subject matter at hand, the teaching of the Great Perfection.

For example, I don't know anything about Chan/Zen, apart from the polemics about it found in early Dzogchen commentaries which date from the late 9th century. So I rarely venture into the Zen forums because I am not really qualified to talk about Chan. All I am qualified to do with respect to Chan and Zen is to ask questions, when they occur to me to ask them, as well as relate what early Tibetan Dzogchen masters thought about the Chan tradition as it existed in Tibet in the late 8th century. I expect that people who have no background in Dzogchen teachings to exercise the same respect when they visit these boards.

They both depend on a kind of introduction. However, the four samadhis are based on the experience of the rig pa'i rtsal dbang, while the four yogas are introduced in a gradual process of pointing out.

The state of dzogchen is to persons what heat is to fire. All fires are hot, but the heat of one fire is not the heat of another fire.

There are five other defective propositions about the basis, the state of dzogchen, which are defective as well.

The indirect means has the same principle—&nbsp;recognizing concepts as dharmatā. This is also based on a guru's instructions. In both cases, recognition is the point. For example, when you encounter someone you know in  a crowd, there is no effort involved in recognizing them. If you have not met someone and only know their name, unless there is someone who can introduce you, you will spend a long time asking every person in the crowd if they are so and so.

A passage from Buddhahood, pg. 161 is instructive here, as it is repeated all over various Great Perfection texts:

If it is objected, “If afflictions are liberated into dharmatā without antidotes, there is no need for purification on the path. Otherwise, liberation would require no effort,” for what reason would those who do not understand be liberated? Asserting that those who understand are liberated merely by recognizing concepts as dharmatā is the fruit of one’s wishes. As such, in order to recognize that concepts are dharmatā, the intimate instructions of the guru are important.

this is the explanation for doubts about the purpose.
In countless past eons, 
since fortunate Atiyogins
with devotion to me, All-Creating Bodhi,
do not meditate a view, do not protect samayas,
do not engage in activities, do not progress on a path, 
do not train on stages, do not have cause and result, 
do not have relative and ultimate,
perceive there is nothing to meditate or accomplish, 
do not generate altruistic intentions, nor use antidotes, 
that perception of the nature of the all-creating mind
is the explanation of the purpose.

Yes, but there is a difference between recognizing that and not recognizing that. The point that Dzogchen tantras consistently make is that practicing the two stages of creation and completion are at best an indirect means of coming to that recognition, and at worst a total deviation from the meaning of the Great Perfection. Rongzom points out that one should not discriminate between mantra or sūtra practice when it comes to the indirect approach. Recognition is the important point in Dzogchen, nothing else.

As for one, secondary practices are useful. As for your second question, no, I am not dismissive of their "validity" per se. 

The point is that creation and completion stages practices do not form part of actual Dzogchen practice, regardless of whether mantra practices are an indirect means of realizing the meaning of Dzogchen teachings from the perspective that Mañjuśrimitra outlined. 

The fact that Dzogchen practice as outlined in the Dzogchen tantras are not involved with the standard secret mantras methods of creation and completion should not be construed as a condemnation of such practices. Dzogchen simply does not make any great use of them. It does not mean they are bad, or that someone who is practicing Dzogchen should avoid them, if they have reason for their use. However, a practitioner of Dzogchen should understand that such practices are not the main point, and that the vehicles that promulgate cause and result with respect to buddhahood suffer from certain deviations with respect to Dzogchen, including anuyoga. Such practices in general are secondary primarily because the vehicles from which they spring have an incomplete understanding of the meaning of Dzogchen. 

One does not need to get involved with those vehicles to practice Dzogchen. One can start out as Dzogchen practitioner, practice the path of Dzogchen, and realize the result of Dzogchen without reciting a single mantra or practicing a single sadhana from any of other five levels of tantra. 

Of course, if someone is trained in what has come to be regarded as the "traditional" approach, typically one practices common and uncommon ngondro, three roots, and then enters the special preliminaries of Dzogpachenpo (hopefully, one will complete these before one becomes too old to practice actual Dzogchen practice). But this is not necessary, and never has been. 

This not a question of "pure Dzogchen" as opposed to some other kind. This is a question of what those instructions that have come down to us in the tantras of and commentaries on the Kun byed rgyal po, etc., the Vajra bridge, etc., and the so called intimate instruction series actually say.  

The point is to understand what the path of Atiyoga is, not the paths of Mahāyoga and Anuyoga which regard Atiyoga as some kind of result that is attained through a cause.

To the extent that a person has the good fortune to meet Dzogchen teachings, it depends on the person. Without meeting a qualified  guru, however, there is no hope that one will discover that knowledge for oneself alone. As the Tantra Without Syllables states:


The dharmakāya is encountered in the instructions.

Vimalamitra states:

Sentient beings experience samsara, cycling within it again and again. Although they abide in samsara, they have never seen the characteristic of samsara because they lack the instruction of a guru.

And:

As such, the nature of vidyā pervades all migrating beings, but they do not understand the instructions of the guru for encountering the dharmakāya in direct perception.

So, you are free to do as you please, but Dzogchen yogis rely on the intimate instructions of their guru.

The Tantra Without Syllables states:

Since the appearance of vidyā is intrinsically perfect,
I do not assert the two accumulations of syllables.

The Blossoming Lotus commentary on this passage by Vimalamitra states:

Everything is perfect within the appearances of vidyā itself. Since [the appearance of vidyā] is intrinsic, it is perfect. Asserting the two accumulations of merit and [pristine consciousness] as the cause of awakening is a deviation— not realizing the meaning of Ati which is free from accomplishment through effort. Within the reality of Ati, the two accumulations of merit (the cause) and pristine consciousness (the result) are not asserted in my self-originated vidyā.

With respect to the creation stage, it says:

Since there is neither emanating nor gathering in me,
the meanings of syllables are totally perfect.

Vimalamitra comments:

Since there is no effort of emanating and collecting the assembly of syllables in my self-liberated appearance, there is no need for a creation stage, like the syllables. The way the syllables located in the ultimate natural nāḍīs are totally perfect is that Samantabhadra father and mother abide within the balls of light, perfect like oil in a small seed—the deities that do not need to be created are innate attributes.

Further:

Since there is no cause in vidyā itself,
where can there be a generation stage syllable?

Vimala comments:

There is no connate cause in vidyā. Since it has always self-appeared without being created by a cause, there is no need in the present to generate that [appearance]. Since it has always been intrinsically complete, where can there be a generation stage seed syllable? Since that is not understood, outer and inner mantra from Mahāyoga on down are deviations.

Further:

Since pristine consciousness and the five kāyas are intrinsically complete,
there is also no A of the completion stage.

Vimala states:

Since pristine consciousness and the five kāyas are complete as innate attributes in vidyā itself, they have always existed. Since the completion stage that depends on the syllables of outer and inner Secret Mantra (based on the syllable A and so on) is a deviation, it also does not exist in Ati.

Vimala also mentions possible deviations within Ati:

Since Mahāyoga Tantra asserts that the outer universe is the celestial mansion and the inhabitants are deities in the utterly pure relative based on words, it deviates from the transcendent state of the self-liberation of the appearances of the six relaxed senses.

Since Anuyoga Tantra asserts the dhātu and pristine consciousness as ultimate based on words, it deviates from the meaning of making the result of Ati Yoga (the sole, unique bindu) into the path, the absolute perfection in which nothing is abandoned.

Furthermore, the proponents of Ati who assert words that are approximations deviate by: 1) leaving the view in the basis, 2) leaving meditation as the mode of the arising of qualities, 3) leaving experience in syllables, 4) leaving conduct in reality, 5) leaving everything as being the mind, and 6) asserting the potentiality and play of appearances as ultimate. Since all of these proponents lack experience, they deviate by grasping a view and meditation of intellectual analysis. As such, because of being free from these assertions of words, there is no emanation and withdrawal. As vidyā itself is not within the range of wisdom (prajñā), it is confirmed as a direct perception which is beyond intellectual analysis. 

Since with the three critical points one abides together with the nonarising dharmatā, there is no need for the activities of hearing, reflection, and meditation. Likewise, there is no distinction between sharpness or dullness in capacity.

Since the experience itself is approached in the self-appearance, the extreme of doubt is eliminated. Since there is freedom from benefit or harm in gathering accumulations or misdeeds, and since this can be immediately applied in experience, vidyā is beyond virtues or misdeeds. In this way, since appearances are liberated directly, there is no great hope for some other antidote. Since the meaning of inexpressibility is experienced on the basis of one’s own voice, those who are beyond words and expressions are those of the unmistaken Atiyoga which is beyond a ground of deviation. Since Ati does not fall into any sort of a ground of deviation, those who assert other designations with words and syllables are explained to be those who deviate.

Prajnaparamita as a path only results in 11th bhumi buddhahood. Lower tantra, according to this tantra only result in 12th bhumi buddhahood. These yanas do not comprehend all phenomena as the display of pristine consciousness and do not lead to the result called Vajradhara, the 13th  bhumi. Prajnaparamita, madhyamaka, and so on as names for reality are synonymous with Dzogchen, Mahamudra and so on.

The primary difference, practically speaking, is that Kamalashila's method is to meditate the two truths alternately; Hashangs method is to meditate them simultaneously. Nubchen states that the former is based on provisional sutras; the latter, definitive sutras.  Nubchen further clarifies that while mahayoga is gradual, since it possesses direct introduction it is actually more rapid than Chan. But because it's view is causal it is inferior to the approach of Dzogchen.

I didn't state that ChNN was the only person teaching Dzogchen, nor did I denigrate any of other teachers who are. For the most part, however, they do not interest me very much. All I stated that ChNN was the only person teaching Dzogchen right now that I find interesting. 

As for my opinion about Tibetan Buddhism's moribund state of development, it is a sentiment I have expressed many times before. There hasn't been a single interesting development in the intellectual history of Tibetan Buddhism since the 15th century. Since the 15th century, the intellectual history of Tibetan Buddhism has been one merely of institutional consolidation, money, and power. This should not be construed as an argument that there have been no interesting authors, teachers and so on. It is a statement that even despite the fact that there have most certainly been interesting authors since the 15th century, ( Ganden Chophel comes to mind) and doubtlessly, realized masters, there has been virtually no development in the intellectual history of Tibetan Buddhism. 

ChNN's chief role has been the experiential revival of Dzogchen traditions that had fallen into obscurity, as well as opening the West to the broad range of the teachings of the Great Perfection and the ancient pre-modern Nyingma tradition —&nbsp;not just Yeshe Lama and texts like it that form the main body of what Tibetans practice as Dzogchen in the present day. 

In Tibet, of course, we had my teacher, the late Khenpo Jigme Phuntsog, who is perhaps one of the pre-eminent interpreters of Longchenpas ouvre; Khenpo Munsel and his students, who took great pains to gather and publish all he could find of obscure Nyingma texts and publish them in what we call "The Very Large Kama"; Dudjom Rinpoche before him who edited whatever he could find into what we call the "Large Kama."

And, BTW, I never called ChNN an "outlier" —&nbsp;that is a term you have insisted on introducing the conversation in your quixotic attempt to explain tradition of which you have little understanding (for example, your silly attempt to force gzhan stong down everyone's throat as "orthodox Nyingma view."). In other words, my friend, you really have no idea what you are talking about. But I am sure that my admonition will not prevent you from continuing to share with us the effluvia of misguided logorrhea to which you are prone when it comes to the subject of the Nyingma school.

In fact, the institutionalization of Nyingma is has lead to a precarious existence for many teachings. Older more obscure ones get left on the shelf in the favor of the latest terma craze —&nbsp;even Mipham complains about this at length. 

For example, Longchenpa lists a total of 84 texts that accompanied the 17 tantras —&nbsp;only 10 of these have been located and published. Hopefully more exist moldering in some library, but for now, we have a paucity of material from the early period of Nyingma, especially Dzogchen —&nbsp;but we have enough. It is these texts that interest me. Pre-15th century, very interesting; post 15th century, increasingly less so with every passing century. (Except of course, the writings and teachings of ChNN. But he is really old school.)

Title: Re: "highest practices" and anti-intellectualism

No, Greg. That is fake news. What I mean by modern Nyingma is the rise of the Nyingma school in general as an institutional entity. This happened in the 17th century. Prior to this, Nyingma had only one major monastic institution founded by Phagmo Drupa's younger brother, Dampa Desheg, in Eastern Tibet during the 12th century, and expanded in 1656. 

Dorje Drag in 1659, and Mindroling in 1676 were established under the patronage of the Fifth Dalai Lama; Palyul was founded in 1665; Dzogchen in 1685 and Shechen, in 1735. 

Basically, prior to the 17th century, Nyingma had no major institutions, unlike Sakya, Kagyu and Gelug, Jonang, or even Bon. Prior to this Nyingma persisted primarily in family lineages and on the fringes of other monastic institutions. 

The person who benefitted the Nyingmapas the most, as can be seen from the above, was the Fifth Dalai Lama. He was responsible for the rise of modern Nyingma. 

This has both positive and negative aspects. The positive aspect is that of course Nyingma received major funding and patronage. 

The negative aspect is that by the 19th century, Nyingma had lost much of its iconoclastic flavor and has come to resemble the Sarma schools far more than it is different from them. I consider this the Kadampafication of Nyingma (and of course, we will all recall Milarepa was no fan of the Kadamapas, calling Dromton a demon who had crippled the Dharma in Tibet because of his control over Atisha). 

Indeed, one of the reasons Longchenpa became so popular, apart from his systematization of the Great Perfection literature of the Nyinthig, is that after lingering in total obscurity for nearly three hundred years, as a result of his Sakya/Kadampa education, he had created an amazing graduated curriculum in the Sems nyid ngal so cycle. This has become the basis for the institutional presentation of Nyingma teachings today, especially as a result of the revival of his popularity by Jigme Lingpa. Ironically, Longchenpa himself was no fan of gradualism in a real sense, writing in defense of Hashang Mahāyāna. Longchenpa also largely remained aloof from the polemical battles that later Nyingmapas waded into with gusto in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. 

The adoption Sakya, Gelug, or Kagyu monastic curricula in these monasteries has also impacted Nyingma in the sense that modern Nyingmapas are trained in a lam rim curriculum heavily influenced by the Kadampa school. Hence, I distinguish modern Nyingma from the wilder, woolier, more interesting, and more heterodox Nyingma of Nubchen, Rongzom, early Nyingthig and other earlier trends of the Great Perfection. You really have no idea how much early Nyingma ideas completely contradict the modern, institutionally-sanitized, homogenized, intellectually-moribund Tibetan Buddhism we see at present.

We can see an encroaching homogenization of Nyingma which really begins during 17tn century, once the Nyingmapas began to have a coherent institutional stake in the Tibetan games of power, prestige and influence.

I have to say Greg, for an Anarchist, you certainly are a staunch supporter of the religious hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism.

Not at all. Mila had ten Nyingma gurus before he met Marpa. I think the account of Mila meeting with Rongton is clearly a political story meant to denigrate Dzogchen teachings, reflective of the uncertainty about Dzogchen among Tibetans because of various log sngags sun phyung texts in circulation at that time influential in Kadampa circles. In fact Mila received Dzogchen teachings from at least two teachers. 

Also keep in mind that Mila is universally regarded as an emanation of Mañjuśrīmitra in Kagyu.

In man ngag lde, the kun zhi is another name for mind, and is distinct from the gzhi. Bonpo texts do not seem to make a distinction between gzhi and kun gzhi, at least not in the ZZNG. In ZZNG, kun gzhi is equated with byang chub sems. For example, the the ZZNG the kun gzhi is defined as having the nature of the three kāyas. 

In the Rig pa rang shar, however, those who identify the kun gzhi as dharmakāya are strongly negated.

This is a very common idea.

In other words if a Buddha is teaching Dharma, a Christian will hear the gospels and a Muslim, the Koran.

I do get it. 

But from my point of view, it is like having an absolutely-beautiful, natural, crystal diamond that is perfect in every way, and thinking that one has to paint some flowers on it to make it prettier. 

What I am also saying is that sadhanas and so on are not part of the main practices taught in the three series of Dzogchen. And as Florin rightly notes, those who think one can approach the Great Perfection through mahāyoga and anuyoga have a flawed perspective. 

If one is going to take the indirect approach, it has to be done as Mipham clarifies:

If one meditates generating the thought that the [three] samadhis and the [four] mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness. 

But frankly, this approach is more trouble than it is worth.

For example, of someone claims they are a Jungian analyst, but instead is practicing DBT and calling it Jungian analysis, one would call it blameworthy. Likewise, if someone is claiming to teach Dzogchen, but instead they teach the methods of Mahā and Anuyoga and call this "Dzogchen," one should call it blameworthy. Most Nyingma teachers do not do this. But there are some who do, and one should be aware that the situation these days is similar to merchants who show beef, but sell horse meat instead. Finally, just because some sadhana has really pretty Dzogchen words like "ka dag," "lhun grub," etc., does not mean that sadhana actually belongs to Dzogchen teachings. A case in point is the Chetsun Nyingthig. The Chetsun Nyingthig's actual Dzogchen instructions are included only in a very short section at the very end of the root text. The rest of it is devoted to discussing the empowerment, the ngondro practice, the sadhana of Chetsun, and so on. It is a wonderful practice, excellent in every way. But when you are practicing some sadhana reciting mantras, you are practicing the two stages, not Dzogchen. This does not mean the Chetsun Nyinthig sucks, does not have blessings (whatever that means) and so on. It means that in that system, when you have finished the two stages connected with the practice of Chetsun, then you move on to actual Dzogchen preliminaries and the main practice of Dzogchen. The main emphasis of the Chetsun Nyingthig is the Guru Yoga of Vimalamitra. It is very profound. But the main practice of Dzogchen is more profound, as Vimalamitra would agree. 

My point is simply that people should have a very clear, formal understanding of the differences between this and that yāna, so they know what they are doing any why. This is the reason why there is a detailed discussion of the nine yānas.

Some people like to follow the modern Nyingma system. I prefer to follow Garab Dorje. We are all free to do as we like.

Pretty simple, it means that the two obscurations have a coarse aspect and a subtle aspect. 

Eliminating the course aspect of the afflictive obscuration means that one will not take rebirth in any of the three lower realms, nor outside of Dharma families and so on. 

The subtle aspect of the afflictive obscuration means that one will still be subject to afflictions, but markedly less so than other ordinary people. 

Eliminating the coarse aspect of the knowledge obscuration means that one will begin to manifest the six clairvoyances, find it very easy to understand difficult Dharma topics and so forth. 

The subtle aspect of the knowledge obscuration means that one will still be subject to innate self-grasping, will lack the two omnisciences and so on. 

What Khenpo Ngachung is stating is that these coarse obscurations cannot be eliminated by those who have not acheived the path of seeing of the lesser vehicles.

The dichotomy you appear to be setting up is that if a Dzogchen practitioner is not a first stage bodhisattva and beyond, then somehow they need to be practicing sadhanas, generating merits, and so on, as in the lower vehicles. But this is not the case. 

Put in terms of the five paths and ten stages: an ordinary person who practices the Great Perfection can eradicate the coarse aspect of the two obscurations even while they have not realized (what is understood in lower vehicles as) the path of seeing, the direct realization of emptiness. This is a special point of the superiority of the Great Perfection teachings. In the eight lower vehicles, it is impossible to eradicate the coarse aspect of the two obscurations below the path of seeing. People who doubt my assertion need to read the works of Khenpo Ngachung.

There is nothing called "higher or lower" capacity in Dzogchen teachings, as Shabkar states:


If this is practiced, all will be liberated;
there is no distinction between sharp and dull capacity.
If one practices, even a cowherd will be liberated.
If one understands the significance of the luminosity of one’s mind through a direct perception,
the rhetoric of scholars is not necessary here;
just as when one eats sugar,
there  is no need for an explanation of the taste of sugar.
Without understanding this, even a paṇḍita will be deluded.
Even if one is skilled in all the explanations of the nine vehicles,
it is like telling a story of a distant place one has not seen;
one is even further from the stage of full awakening than heaven is from the earth.

This is why I maintain that while direct democracy is great at the town meeting level; it does not scale to running a large country and never can because even with a good education, no individual person can hope to have a grasp of all the information needed to make good policy decisions about every aspect of a nation, and if asked to weigh in on these questions, average people are likely to respond from a position of an absence of knowledge, unlike their intimate knowledge of their local community.

This nothing other than the indirect approach to Dzogchen practice. 

The point is that when one is engaged in Dzogchen practice there is no Mahāyoga, no Anuyoga. 

Practicing secondary practices with Dzogchen view is the indirect approach indicated by Mañjuśrimitra, and later, by Rongzom in chapter six of his Intro to Mahāyāna.

Anuyoga is a special case because it's explanation of the basis is the same as the Great Perfection. However, even Anuyoga practice is not Dzogchen since it regards Dzogchen as something to attain. This is why it is classed as part of the 8 lower vehicles. Practices like Chetsun Nyinthig, Thigle Gyachan, etc., are not Dzogchen practices. Even these practices with very nice words, and so on, are part of the indirect approach to Dzogchen teachings. They approach the main practices of Dzogchen as a completion stage. But the two stages do not exist in Dzogchen per se.

As the armed forces are under the control of the civilian government, they are supposed to be driven by our political body, the Congress. Only the Congress has the right to declare war. The executive branch has limited abilities to use the military in the case of attacks by other countries, but does not have the right to declare war [hence most of the so called "war on terror" is based on the latter idea].  

The people in the Pentagon as well as the Intelligence Services are generally quite highly educated. For example, the Pentagon has accepted human-driven climate change for decades, irrespective of the deluded opinions of the flat-earthers presently in the White House and the GOP in general. So yes, in matters of military goals and strategies, I generally think when it comes to defense of the US, they do a pretty good job. When there are screwups like the Iraq Invasion, it is not on the military, it is on the civilian government. In my opinion, in a direct democracy campaign US citizens would have overwhelmingly made the choice to invade both Iraq and Afghanistan. So, again, in my opinion, the Congress acted out the will of the people in those two wars, as foolish as they were.

Each of the nine yānas is in independent, self-sufficient vehicle. Otherwise, there is no point in calling them individual "vehicles."

The actual name is Theg pa rim dgu, the nine progressive vehicles. The implication of this however is not that one learns for example, śrāvakayāna, then one moves on to pratyekabuddhayāna, etc. The intention of this is that higher vehicles embrace the intention of the lower vehicles. Thus, if you have been introduced to Dzogchen teachings, there is no need to practice common Mahāyāna since the intention of common Mahāyāna is fully included in the vehicle of Atiyoga. It is not the case however that the lower vehicles can encompass the higher vehicles, because the view and practice of the nine progressive vehicles moves from lower to higher. It is generally regarded as a downfall to prefer to practice a lower vehicle having been introduced to the practices of a higher vehicle: for example, preferring to observe one's pratimokśa vows rather than breaking them to benefit another according to Mahāyāna vows.

The scope of direct democracy must necessarily be limited to local decisions, for example, whether a town wishes to allocate money to installing a broadbadn network. 

Direct democracy simple does not work at a national level, and shouldn't. For example, I would not want people voting directly issues of national security about which they necessarily have little or no information.

Anytime you take an empowerment, you are making a commitment to that method of practice from now until awakening. That is essentially what a yidam is, i.e., a commitment to the path of awakening. The whole idea of "special yidams" is a bit of quasi theistic superstition. It does not matter who anyone's yidam is since the continuum of pristine consciousness of all yidams is the same.

People have karmic relations with this or that practice. But in reality, everyone in Mahāyāna has the same yidam: buddhahood.

It is absolutely sufficient:


For example, the trikāya chapter in the Suvarnaprabhāsa Sūtra states:


For example, lightening arises in an empty sky and light appears based upon lightening. Likewise, the sambhogakāya appears based on dharmakāya and the nirmanakāya appears based on the sambhogakāya.

The Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃk̄ara states:

The divisions of the kāyas of the buddhas
are the svabhāvakāya and the sambhogakāya,
and the other one is the nirmanakāya.
The first two are supports. 

And:

The svabhāvakāya is uniform,
subtle, connected with [the sambhogakāya],
exhibits the enjoyment of all joys,
and is asserted as the cause of the abundance of the sambhogakāya.

The svabhāva/dharmakāya is what one realizes for oneself. This realization spontaneously produces the other two kāyas. Therefore, it is sufficient to realize the dharmakāya alone. 

The difference is that people of your inclination, gradualists, are algorithmic in their approach and understanding of practice and realization. People of our inclination, non-gradualists, are dialectical in our approach and understanding of practice and realization. 

In fact, the whole Prasanga approach of Candrākirtī makes gradualism unnecessary. Just as one does not need to use syllogism (a form of algorithm) to demonstrate emptiness, and can demonstrate emptiness through consequences (a form of dialectics), likewise, one can realize dharmakāya dialectically, without the need to go step by step. Even in sūtrayāna, such persons are called thod rgal bas, people who skip stages.

Even in the gsar ma schools, creation and completion are supposed to practiced as an inseparable unity. Nevertheless, in fact people generally practice sadhanas, regardless of school, in two phases. Even if you are practicing the creation stage and completion stage inseparably, the fact is that the reason you do so is because the creation stage is completely conceptual since it is based in words and concepts.

The Great Perfection, like all other expressions of Buddhadharma, posits that individuals are unique and independent from one another. Everyone bears their own karma and results, everyone accumulates and purifies afflictions individually, everyone cycles through samsara on their own through the power of their own delusion. 

The Buddha never rejected a conventional self, just as he never rejected the principle of the individual accumulation and ripening of karma. 

The term "nondual" in Dzogchen texts, depending on context, either means freedom from the extremes of existence and nonexistence, or it means that we confuse our personal, individual experience of the world as a self and an other in absence of self and an other which can be established. 

It does not mean that everything is one substance or one consciousness, etc. The latter proposition is a nonBuddhist point of view with no place in Buddhadharma at all.

The definition of liberation is consistent in Buddhadharma, from the canon of the śrāvakas to the tantras of the Great Perfection. In all these Buddhadharma traditions, liberation is defined as freedom from afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms. Apart from that, there is no other liberation taught in Buddhadharma.

The Buddha found the formless āyatana concentrations he was taught by Udraka Ramapūtra and Ārāla Kālāma useless in so far as they did not lead to liberation, but instead merely created traces for taking rebirth in the formless āyatanas. So, yes, he did state these were completely useless. 

Most people do not realize that meditation is a kind of karma that creates results. When ordinary, common people meditate on the form realm dhyānas for the formless dhyānas they are creating seeds for rebirth in these realms. When Buddha meditated on these dhyānas he did so in order to observe that they were suffering, a cause for suffering, and that there was a cessation and a path from that suffering. When he had meditated and recognized the pernicious nature of all of these meditative "accomplishments," he entered the Vajropama-samadhi which destroyed every last trace of latent affliction which would cause rebirth in the three realms.

The mahāmudra of the basis is the all-basis. The all-basis mind has a relative aspect as well as an ultimate one.

Definitely. For example, in Dzogchen teachings (of which this text is one), the all-basis(kun gzhi, ālaya) is considered merely a repository of traces. It is different than the the basis (gzhi, sthana). In the Yogacara school, tathāgatagarbha is considered to be another name of the ālayavijñāna. 

Otherwise, the consequence is that one is asserting that Padmasambhava is asserting, contra all sūtras on the subject, that the self of the nonBuddhists is equivalent with the tathāgatagarbha, the all-basis, and so on.

On the other hand, the text later clarifies the meaning of the madhyamaka, tathāgatagarbha, ordinary mind, and ālaya with respect to vidyā, but it never invokes the self of the nonBuddhists in that discussion.

This is a common misunderstanding of this passage. What the passage is actually referring to is the different names people have for the mind, the relative aspect. 

"The so-called mind is knowing (rig rig) and clear (tur tur),
With respect to its existence, it does not exist as even one thing;
with respect to a source, it is the source of the variety of samsara and nivana, happiness and suffering. 
With respect to assertions about it, there are assertions about it according to eleven vehicles. 
It [the mind] is give inconceivable individual names. 
(1) Some call it "the mind-essence," "the mind-essence."
(2) Some non-Buddhists give it the name "the self."
(3) Śrāvakas call "oral instruction,"oral instruction." (absence of self of persons taught by the Buddha)
(4) Cittamatrins give it the name "mind."
(5) Some call it "prajñāpāramitā."
(6) Some give it the name "tathāgatagarbha."
(7) Some give it the name "mahāmudra."
(8) Some give it the name "sole unique bindu."
(9) Some give it the name "dharmadhātu."
(10) Some give it the name "all-basis."
(11) Some give it the name "ordinary."

Thus, we can see from this that the text, The Introduction to Vidyā entitled "The Self-liberation through Naked Seeing, is not claiming that all vehicles are party to the same truth, but rather, that everyone has different names for the mind.

As long as people intend to try and at least find a proper Dzogchen teacher, than as far as I am concerned, they can read whatever they want and their teacher will sort out any misconceptions they may have gained. If they do not intend to find a teacher, they can still read tregchö and thögal instructions that have been published by famous teachers on the web and buy them in books with no questions asked, like Natural Liberation. 

Question 1: how many of you own Natural Liberation (Wisdom Pubs)? 

Question 2: how many of you have the lung for it? 

A lot of this business about restricted texts is western neurosis. I have mentioned before that in my opinion, there is a lot of stuff from Anuttarayoga tantra that is far more deserving of being "restricted" than anything one can read in a Dzogchen tantra.

Hi Magnus:

The Great Image translated by Ani Jinpa is a very flawed book (though not because of her translation). If you look at the colophon, you will see that it was cobbled together and edited from various sources in the late 19th century by Dharma Senge because he thought the original terma version which was taken out by Jomo Menmo was too difficult for non-scholars to understand since it has many, many, interesting citations. Even though it is a terma, it is not a terma in the traditional sense in that it was composed by another Tibetan, Zhang Gnas gsar, who is 12th in line of the oral transmission from Vairocana. So it was not written down until a couple of centuries later. 

The earliest recension of the accounts found in the 'Dra 'bag chen mo that are available to us is in the commentary on the Cuckoo of Vidya that I mentioned above which is found in the Bairo rgyud 'bum. The Bairo 'gyud 'bum text mentions the lineage you mention, but states that it happens within the span of 200 hundred years or eight human generations. So if we assume that Vairocana meets Śr̄ī Siṃha in the late eight century, this means that Garab Dorje's birth can be dated at the earliest around 600 CE. 

In short, there is nothing wrong per se with the various conflicting lineage histories of Dzogchen. But when doing history we should not take them literally as facts, in the same way that we do not take Tonpa Shenrab's birth 18,000 years ago as a fact merely because the Bonpos claim it to be so. As I mention above, when it comes to history, it needs to correspond to ordinary human perception. This applies the Buddha, Jesus, Tonpa Shenrab, Garab Dorje, Muhammed, Shankaracarya, and any other founder or major figure of a religion about whom fantastic legends gradually develop. If we do take them as facts, we will wind up becoming fundamentalist ninnies.

Wth respect to visionary encounters, such as that between Vima and Chetsun, that is a whole different ball of wax. That cannot be subject to any kind of analysis. One either accepts it or not. 

The real lineage of Dzogchen cannot be found in a book.

Title: Re: Nagkpa or Nyingma shawl and dress
Content:
Long hair is not considered a mandala of ḍakinīs, it has to be blessed that way. Otherwise long hair is just long hair. 

In Indian Vajrayāna, each deity has it's own special commitments in terms of accouterments. For example, if you receive the Cakrasamvara empowerments, you were expected to have a set of six bone ornaments. In the beginning, when one's practice is at the level of weak heat on the path of application, one would be expected to wear these in private, and when one's practice becomes stronger, one would be expected to test one's resolve in practice by wearing them in increasingly public settings. For example, the reason why Padmasambhava holds a skullcup and a vajra is that is part of the commitments of having received the Śrī Heruka (Yang dag) empowerment, his main yidam. 

Tibet is a different place than India and a different culture, so a different set of accouterments developed over the Indian layer. Slowly, over time, in a different culture, a new set of accouterments developed and became meaningful. Tibet is a country where it is difficult to run around half-naked like an Indian sadhu. In India, no mantrins wore a red and white shawl. If they were beginners, they just wore white like everyone else in public, and in private, they wore their requisite ornaments if they could afford them or carried a card painted with them. Tibet is a pretty cold place, so it is not practical for most people to run around without clothes. 

Since we are in the Dzogchen forum, I will speak plainly. Dzogchen practitioners have no need of these kind of things. It has nothing to do with Dzogchen practice directly. The real point of the hair empowerment, as it relates to Dzogchen, is to have uncontrived hair, uncontrived clothes, and uncontrived dwellings, because the principle of Dzogchen is nonfabrication. To summarize, having an elegant Ngakpa kit defeats the whole meaning of uncontrived hair, cloths, etc.

When my guru Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje emerged from his first three year retreat in the early 1950's, he looked like a ragged bum. When he went to see Dudjom Rinpoche in Kongpo, he arrived where Dudjom Rinpoche was teaching, and sat in the back. But when Dudjom Rinpoche saw him there, he made fun of all the elegant Ngakpas sitting in the Gonpa for their carefully tended hair, ornaments, and robes, and asked Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje come and sit next to him, commenting that Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje was a real Ngakpa, unlike all the elegant so called Ngakpas sitting in the assembly. So if we want to be Ngakpas, it should be our intention to be real Ngakaps. Also, if we wish to kit up and run around in Ngakpa gear, it is probably better that we first develop some power of mantra. This does not happen overnight. For this reason, some teachers forbid their students to where Ngakpa gear until they have some juice in their practice. 

Now, for someone who is following a Dzogchen path, Ngakpa ordinations can be aspirational. But it is not necessary for Dzogchen practitioners to receive these kinds of empowerments. If we do, it is probably a result of past karma, as Greg mentioned. 

A Dzogchen practitioner has no need to become a monk, but there are many monks that practice Dzogchen. It is not necessary for a Dzogchen practitioner to become a ngakpa, but there are many ngakpas who also practice Dzogchen. In the primary empowerment texts of the Dzogchen tradition, you will never discover an empowerment which requires one to wear anything. It is not even necessary for a Dzogchen practitioner to become a lay person with all five vows. It is not even necessary for a Dzogchen practitioner to formally declare allegiance to this or that form of Buddhism, Tibetan or otherwise. Why? Because Dzogchen is the essence of Buddhadharma. Buddhism is fragmented into sects and traditions. Dzogchen is beyond sects and traditions. Buddhism is cultural. Dzogchen is beyond culture. Buddhism is a religion. Dzogchen is beyond religion. 

I am not telling you this because I do not like the Ngakpa tradition. The Ngakpa tradition is just fine. But it really does not have anything to do with being a Dzogchen practitioner. When one is a Dzogchen practitioner, it is important to go to the core of the teachings and not be caught up in the rind.

The stripped shawl evolved long after Padmasambhava left Tibet, so I think he has very little to say on the subject. There is one spurious tantra floating around on the internet that makes some claims, but it's source is highly questionable. No Tibetan original seems to exist for this text. 

Ngakpas like the Sakya family commonly wear a white lower robe and an upper red shawl. My personal opinion is that the stripped shawl evolved out of this custom. When we see depictions of ancient Ngakpas like the 25 disciples, they are never depicted with the striped shawl. We can understand from this that it is a relatively modern custom that originated in Eastern Tibet within the last 400 hundred years.

In general, you don't need robes to a Dharma practitioner. 

As far as Ngakpa vows go, if you gave taken any major empowerment, you already have them. 

In terms of wearing a stripped shawl, as you have already discovered, the criteria for wearing these shawls shifts from Sangha to Sangha. What you can ascertain from this is that there is no canonical rule. The use of the striped shawl is a Tibetan innovation that evolved gradually over time. Lay mantra practitioners in India wore white, like other lay people.

Therefore, you should do as your primary teacher suggests, and not worry about what other people do.

People have been predicting the collapse of capitalism since Marx. They have all been wrong. 

We are definitely reaching environmental sustainability limits, but that has nothing to with capitalism (apart from the fact that capitalism is destroying the planet and the only way to prevent that is a global government that sets strict environmental limitations).

Nationalism is a disease. It has no place in the modern world. Eventually, people will see this. It might take them a couple of centuries. Hopefully we will not blow up the planet before then. 

People have a right to autonomy and self-determination. This does not mean that Nationalism is the way to go.

One assumes that ancient Mahāyānis had ample contact and debate with those who were reputed to be śrāvaka arhats.

I understand. The historical narrative of the arrival of Dzogchen teaching in Tibet was radically altered by the revelation of the Vima Nyinthig in 1118, so much so that it literally eclipsed earlier narratives. There are no traditional Tibetan teachers that question this narrative, even though it definitely is the case that prior to the VN, the lingo of the three series was never used by anyone. For example, the earliest comprehensive history of Dharma composed by Nyangral in the late 12th does not mention these terms at all. 

He refers to five main systems of Dzogchen. The first one is the the one we understand as klong sde, which he simply summarizes as the lineage given to Yudra Nyingpo connected with the five tantras typically now associated with klong sde. But he does not mention Mipham Gonpo, nor 'Dzeng. It appears that he does not know about the Vajra Bridge at all. 

He mentions the lineage of Aro Yeshe Jungney. He mentions the cycle of the Kun byed rgyal po. He mentions the Brahmin cyle. He also mentions the unsurpassed Dzogchen cycle of the 17 tantras. He never mentions anything about the three series anywhere. He was a generation younger than Zhangton Tashi Dorje, the  terton of the VN, so this definitely shows that in the late twelfth century, the idea of the three series was restricted to the circle around Zhangton. Thus, it is really only in post- 12th century texts outside of the VN where we begin to see the systemization of the three series applied to Dzogchen teachings.

Title: Re: The attainment of the Arhats
Content:
The location of traces is in the mind stream of course. Daṃṣṭrasenam, in his commentary on the 100,000 lines Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra, notes that the result of possessing those traces mentions specifically that arhats can err, gossip, can be unattractive, are forgetful, and so on. 

But the above only refers to past traces, the absence of which is how the eighteen unshared qualities of a buddha are defined. But that is not really the most important point. Below we will see too that it is claimed that arhats also do not abandon the traces of conceptuality. 

The most important point is that śrāvakayanists in general do not meditate on the view of emptiness. As we will see below, they meditate in the four truths and this is how they attain their awakening. They realize the person as a momentary formation and this is what it means to say that an arhat realizes "the selflessness of persons." But they do not meditate directly on the view of emptiness in anyway. The  Goenka Vipassana school is an excellent example of this principle.

Bhavaviveka II mentions in the Tarkajvala that the difference between nirvana of a buddha and an arhat is the the latter's nirvana is result of totally abandoning the two obscurations, while the latter's nirvana is merely severing the continuum of their physical body in samsara. He remarks too that the traces of affliction from cultivating afflictions from beginningless time exist within arhats. He distinguishes buddhas by pointing out that they totally eliminate all afflictions along with their traces by cultivating the view of emptiness for a long while, and they eliminate the knowledge obscuration the same way. This is not how arhats attain their realization since their realization is attained not by meditating on emptiness, but rather by meditating the four noble truths in sixteen moments on the path of seeing. 

Vibhuticandra says much the same thing in his commentary on the Bodhicaryāvatāra:

With respect to the traces of emptiness, since ṡrāvakas and so on cannot bear the fact that all phenomena are empty, it is said they are liberated solely through seeing four truths of nobles. Since they obtain freedom only through the direct perception of the "truths" — suffering, the origin, the cessation, and the path— of what use to them is seeing emptiness?

Jayananda's commentary on the Madhyamakāvatāra states: 

Therefore, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha do not abandon the affliction of the traces of conceptuality, but because bodhisattvas, beginning on the eighth bhumi, are able to exhaust the affliction of the traces of of conceptuality through the power of the path of effortlessness and characteristiclessness, they are able to attain buddhahood.

Thus, it is somewhat inane to speculate about where traces reside in an arhat. It is also somewhat foolish to assert that arhats realize the selflessness of phenomena when it has nothing at all to do with how they achieve their realization since they never even meditate the view of the emptiness of the person let alone emptiness in general. 

Finally, concerning the Lanka and its samadhi-intoxicated arhats, Jñānavajra states:

With respect to that, the three liberations are the three awakenings which are equivalent in abandoning afflictions. 

"The absence of self in phenomena," and so on means that the ultimate suchness and the pristine consciousness which realizes that is liberated from afflictions and abandons the obscuration of knowledge —&nbsp;this is Mahāyāna of the result. 

It is taught that śrāvakas cannot realize that. "Just as..." and "They are distracted by characteristics" means they are distracted because they conceptualize particular and universal characterisics of the aggregates and so on, and thus cannot abandon the knowledge obscuration. In the same way, though they indeed abandon the active causes of the afflictive obscuration, they cannot abandon the latent ones. Through perceiving sensation and perception as flaws, they solely rely on the method of pacifying them and are intoxicated with an intoxicating samadhi that lacks the wisdom that realizes the truth. Since they abandon the manifest causes of affliction, they reside in the uncontaminated dhātu. If is asked whether that is their ultimate result, they do no reach an ultimate result apart from that. That being the case, if it is wondered whether or not they are outside of and turned away from samsara, through realizing the emptiness of the person as being a momentary formation and understanding a self is an agent of action, there is no further accumulated karma for birth in samsara and the causal condition for the active cause of craving and addiction are absent, just as a log floating on the ocean does sink to the bottom, there is no certainty of their remaining in one place. If it is wondered how long they remain in the the uncontaminated dhātu, it is said "Samadhi, etc..." 

"Then I will cause them to obtain the dharmakāya..." means that as explained already, when through their own roots of virtue and the blessings of the tathāgata they awaken from uncontaminated dhātu and generate the mind for supreme awakening. Having filled their compliment of the two accumulations, they will obtain the dharmakāya."

Thus we can also see there is no place where such arhats "reside" after death, no Hinayāna pure land. After their nirvana, arhats have no location per se, being like "logs floating on the ocean, moved by the waves."

Attachment is not the issue, traces are. For example, the Prajñāpāramitā states:

Subhuti, while there is no difference in the abandonment of affliction, the Tathāgata has abandoned all connection with traces. Srāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have not abandoned all connection with traces...there are aspects of bodily and verbal desire, hatred and ignorance in śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. However, the traces of those are not harmful in the same way they are for common immature people.

Or་ the Ārya-bodhisattva-piṭaka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

The uncontaminated pristine consciousness (jñāna) of the śrāvakas 
has not completely destroyed traces. 

The Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Just as a log floating on the ocean
is always moved by waves,
likewise confused śrāvakas
are moved by the "wind" of characteristics. 
Though prevented from being activated,
they are confused through the other traces of affliction,
and intoxicated by the bliss of samadhi,
they abide in the uncontaminated dhātu (nirvana).

Āryan equipoise is the state that arises when one has eliminated all proliferation about phenomena. That freedom from proliferation is emptiness. But it cannot be taken as a conceptual object since conceptual objects are proliferation. The way to discover freedom from proliferation is exactly as Śāntideva describes it, and I paraphrase, when neither an entity nor a nonentity rests before the mind, at that moment since there is no other alternative, the mind is pacified. That is āryan equipoise.

No, not all three poisons. And while there is need for the eradication of latent afflictions from strong/stong to weak/weak, there is no change in view at all. In other words, Arhats and stream entrants have identical views of selflessness.

No, a stream enterer is free from the fetter of attachment to wrong views. Such a person is not bound by the aggregates, they are subject to the effects of latent afflictions that keep them in samsara for a further 7 births. But they have no wrong views concerning the absence of persons in the aggregates at all, despite whatever other misconceptions they may hold.

No, since the śrāvakas maintain these dharmas —&nbsp;aggregates, āyatanas, and dhātus —&nbsp;are substantially real. Vasubandhu uses the example whereby a pot is a relative truth, its shards, are ultimate. 

But until we come to Madhyamaka, there is no school that can escape the charge of being substantialist, including Yogacara (a form of nondual substantialism). 

Also, Candrakīrti's comments about the realization of the emptiness of phenomena with respect to arhats is only considered from the point of view of recognizing the absence of inherent existence. But the emptiness of inherent existence is not the profound Mahāyāna emptiness free from four extremes.

Longchenpa, in this case, is writing about the second word of Garab Dorje, "Decide one thing." ChNN parses this as "remain without doubt." How do we remain without doubt or decide on one thing? By using different kinds of experience to discover knowledge of the our state, aka the basis. 

Also, it states in chapter 5 of Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra (sgra thal gyur) very clearly:

"The fault of not meditating
is the visible appearance of samsara.


The recognition of the basis is nothing at all like grace. Dzogchen teachings require a great deal of effort until you actually do decide on on thing — then you can continue in the confidence of liberation, or as ChNN puts, "continue in that state."

However, just so we can be absolutely clear the context from which you are speaking, precisely which of Longchenpa's statements are you referring to? Which book? Which translation? Which chapter? Which page? 

There is no grace in Dzogchen teachings at all. For example, when we talk of "the teaching through blessings" or the lineage of the transcendent state of the victors, what is actually meant is that the Sambhogakāya communicates the teachings through light to the buddhas of the five families and so on. But there is no concept in Dzogchen which resembles the concept of Christian grace at all, i.e., "the free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings."

For example, the seventh mind training is involved with gaining experience in bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality so that one does not mistake them for one's vidyā (rig pa). 

The idea that discovering knowledge (rig pa) of ones state (byang chub sems) is acausal is ludicrous since the consequence of such a statement is that no one needs direct introduction at any time ever and that discovering knowledge (rig pa) of ones state (byang chub sems) can happen at any time to anyone including animals, hell beings and pretas. In fact the point is made over and over again that the cause for discovering knowledge (rig pa) of ones state (byang chub sems) is the intimate instructions of one's guru.

I think you need to study a bit more of the history of Buddhism and restrain your speculations for the time being. 

There is virtually no evidence for Mahāyāna in Thailand after the collapse of the Khmer empire in the 13th century. Mahāyāna, including Vajrayāna, in SE Asia collapsed with the collapse of Buddhism in India since it was dependent on Indian Buddhism.

There is a Dzogchen path. It involves the seven mind trainings, semzins, rushans, etc., all as means to discover what was introduced, eliminate doubt about it, and thereby obtain confidence in it.

You need to read the Wisdom at the Time of Death Sūtra:


In Sanskrit: Arya atajñana nama mahāyāna sutra
In Tibetan: ‘Phags pa ‘da’ ka na ye shes she bya ba theg pa chen po’i mdo
In English: Noble Pristine Consciousness at the Time of Death Mahayana Sutra. 


Homage to all the Buddhas and Bodisattvas. 

At one time this was heard by me: the Bhagavan was staying in the palace of the king of the gods in Akaniṣṭha teaching Dharma to the whole retinue. After Akashagarbha made prostrations to the Bhagavan, he made this request:

“Bhagavan, how should a bodhisattva view the mind at the time of death?”

Then the Bhagavan replied:

“Akashagarbha, at the time a bodhisattva dies, he or she should meditate on the pristine consciousness at the time of death. That pristine consciousness is: since all phenomena are pure by nature, the thought of the non-existence of things is the best meditation. Since all phenomena are included in bodhicitta, the thought of great compassion is the best meditation. Since all phenomena are imperceptible and luminous, the thought which has no attachment to things at all is the best meditation. Because the mind is realized to be pristine consciousness, the thought that does not seek buddhahood elsewhere is the best meditation.”

The Bhagavan spoke these verses:

Since all phenomena are pure by nature, 
meditate the thought of the non-existence of things. 
With bodhicitta,
meditate the thought of great compassion.
Imperceptible by nature, luminous, 
meditate without any attachment to things at all.
Mind is the cause of the arising of pristine consciousness, 
do not seek buddhahood elsewhere. 

Thus the Bhagavan spoke, and and retinue, the bodhisattva Akashagarbha, etc., was very pleased. and praised the Bhagavan’s words. 

The Pristine Consciousness at Time of Death Mahāyāna Sūtra is complete.

The Yogāvacara tradition is a syncretic tradition with no Indian antecedents or relationship with Vajrayāna at all of the kind we find in Tibet and Japan. We might indeed call it a indigenous tradition, but to call it "Tantric" results from a misunderstanding of what Buddhist tantra is and what tantras are.
