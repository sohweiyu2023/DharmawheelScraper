Content:
Oh, don't get me wrong, I still enjoy reading texts like the Kosha and so on, but I am not longer under the il/delusion that liberation lies in that direction. Studying medieval philsophy, while entertaining, is a hobby. 

As I said elsewhere, for Dzogchen all you really need to understand is the five poisons, the five elements, body, voice and mind, as well as the eight examples of illusion. That is about the extent of "abidharma" and madhyamaka you need to understand. You do not even need to understand the five aggregates, etc. 

This dawned on me in April when I was teaching a course on Tibetan Medicine (which is all about the five elements and how they create, maintain and destroy the body) and realized that in all the thousands of pages of Tibetan texts I have translated and read of original Dzogchen material, apart from the five poisons, the vast portion of other topics in Abhidharma, the complex pirouettes of Abhisamaya, the scheme of the two truths and so on, is more or less completely absent in Dzogchen tantras apart from when they are criticizing these schemes or presenting the views of the different yānas. 

Of course the Dzogchen tantras themselves deal with the doctrines of other yānas, mostly critically. And of course to be a translator of Dzogchen texts etc., yes, you need to study everything from the three vows all the way up the ladder -- especially if you want to become enmeshed in the texts of Longchenpa. So in answer to your other question, I am not sorry for having studied anything. All study can be taken with you into your next life. I am a "knowledge friendly anti-intellectual" these days. 

To practice Dzogchen, you need to study very little. You just need to receive transmission from a qualified master (cannot underestimate the importance of that) and then go practice. If you think you need to study many things to understand Dzogchen then you are wasting your time. Why can I say this? Because many simple, uneducated people have acheived total liberation through Dzogchen teachings. Butchers, hunters, farmers, stone carvers, laborers of all kinds, people who did not spend years in retreat learning complicated practices and doctrines. 

Dzogchen boils down to rigpa and marigpa i.e. knowledge or ignorance of the real condition of your body speech and mind which is created out of the five elements [yes mind too is a created out of the five elements].

My remark concerned Dalton, not Nubchen. 

Anyway, the nine yānas are not a problem, since they include the tirthika vehicles as well, following the scheme laid out in the sgra thal gyur (first yāna, yāna of gods and humans). 

The nine yānas are not reflective of the hostility Dzogchen recevied in Tibet, nor the continuing hostility Dzogchen has been subjected to in various Buddhist quarters, Sakya, Kagyu as well as Kadampa/Gelug. 

The Bonpos, contrary to the post 10th century mythology of the imperial period, were never hostile to Dzogchen despite the fact that they definitely pushed back against in the three way political contest between Chinese influence, Indian influence, and native traditions. 

It is funny you know: in the colophon of the Rigpa Rangshar tantra, when Trisrong Detsen is presenting the Rigpa Rangshar to Nyanbang he says “This [tantra] is evil mantra (ngan sngags) that will ruin Tibet. If Tibet comes to ruin, you should move this outside of it.” 

What is hilarious about this of course is that the Rigpa Rangshar barely contains any mantras, has no methods of liberation or union, etc., and discusses the four empowerments of man ngag sde in only the barest of terms. But the message is Dzogchen is that anyone can understand it and practice it (providing they have transmission of course). This is threatening to Indian/Kadampa style gradualism that has come to dominate all schools of Tibetan Buddhism including modern Nyingma and Bon.

Wisdom (insert favorite jargon here i.e. Jñāna, God, Brahmin, Yeshe, George, Turiyatva etc.) is a state, i.e. the basis (sthana). It is unaffected by either knowledge or ignorance, cannot be improved or damaged, is permanent, self-originated, empty, radiant, etc.,  has the three kāyas, everyone possesses it, and so on -- you know the drill.

The Dzogchen teachings are neither a philosophy, nor a religious doctrine, nor a cultural tradition. Understanding the message of the teachings means discovering one's own true condition, stripped of all the self-deceptions and falsifications which the mind creates.

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 123-124). Kindle Edition. 

Dzogchen is not a school or sect, or a religious system. It is simply a state of knowledge which masters have transmitted beyond any limits of sect or monastic tradition.

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 171-172). Kindle Edition. 

A monk, without giving up his vows, can perfectly well practice Dzogchen, as can a Catholic priest, a clerk, a workman, and so on, without having to abandon their role in society, because Dzogchen does not change people from the outside.

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 183-184). Kindle Edition. 

Every religion, every spiritual teaching, has its basic philosophical principles, its characteristic way of seeing things. Within the philosophy of Buddhism alone, for example, there have arisen different systems and traditions, often disagreeing with each other only over subtleties of interpretation of the fundamental principles. In Tibet these philosophical controversies have lasted up until the present day, and the resulting polemical writings now form a whole body of literature in itself. But in Dzogchen no importance at all is attached to philosophical opinions and convictions. The way of seeing in Dzogchen is not based on intellectual knowledge, but on an awareness of the individual's own true condition.

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 185-189). Kindle Edition.

All our concepts and beliefs, no matter how profound they may seem, are like nets which trap us in dualism. When we discover our limits we have to try to overcome them, untying ourselves from whatever type of religious, political, or social conviction may condition us.

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 193-195). Kindle Edition. 

For example, those who already have a certain familiarity with Tibetan culture might think that to practice Dzogchen you have to convert to either Buddhism or Bon, because Dzogchen has been spread through these two religious traditions. This shows how limited our way of thinking is.

Anyone can have the first vision. Most people manage the second vision with relative ease. Many, though less, even manage the third. 

For example, the Rigpa Rangshar has a detailed presentation of the 21 capacities. Only the best of the best acheive the body of light in this lifetime. Most of the rest acheive buddhahood in the bardo after varying length of time after death. The rest take rebirth in the pure nirmanakāya buddhafields. 

The energy of the wisdom of rigpa neither increases nor does it decrease regardless of the four visions. 

The "path" in Dzogchen is not like "path" in other systems, where you start out from point a and wind up at point b. The "path" of Dzogchen is simple removing the jaundice of ignorance so you see what is there all along from the begining. It is not about acquiring something new you did have before.

It is best if we agree to disagree. 

It could only be gradual if you consider sems sde gradual (it isn't). Instead, it is scheme outlining the intention of the three series in very broad strokes.

Dzogchen is a kind of knowledge: you either have it or you don't. To the extent that there is a path in Dzogchen, that path consists of discovering what you have not discovered. This is the reason for the special preliminaries as I am sure you will agree. 

So, there is a path to discovering this knowledge, but it is not really gradual in the sense of gathering the two accumulations and so on as in sutra and tantra.

That is correct, ChNN clearly states that his equation of the three statements with sems sde, klong sde, and man ngag sde is based on his dreams and is not an explanation one will find in any other master's teachings.

However, it is not a gradual approach. Nothing in Dzogchen is gradual. If it is gradual, it is not Dzogchen, even if it is useful.

Hi Sonam:

I was not criticizing you -- I was trying to bring some clarity to the issue of "secret" as opposed to what is appropriate to share. I think in general people in Dzogchen confuse the idea with "secret" with samaya. There is very little in Dzogchgen that is "secret" unlike tantric practices. There are many things in Vajrayāna that are secret in a concrete way. But it is not like that in Dzogchen. So we are in broad agreement. I just wanted to clarify that while Dzogchen is not secret, we still have samaya not to share things with people who are not interested.

Hi Sonam:

While what you say is true, in general Dzogchen is not "secret"; ChNN also regularly reminds people that Dzogchen practices are not to be shared with people who do not have the proper transmission. "Secret" and samaya are different. "Secret" means that no one should know. Samaya means that you can discuss with people who have same transmission. "rgya rgya rgya" means that you should maintain the samaya of body, of speech, and of mind with regard to the teachings. It just means to take care to not share them with people who are not interested, to not think to do so, speak about them, or show them with your body. 

̆But "samaya" does not mean "secret" -- it comes from two words "sam + yama" -- it really means "keeping perfect discipline".

While it is true that in SMS there is a gradual way proceeding in the base and the first level, it is hyper-abbreviated compared to the traditional approach, the emphasis being on gaining experience in each of the topics. The practice amounts recommended are just recommendations, with a minimum of a week for somethings, and a day for other things. 

But the important thing to remember is that SMS is not mandatory, and everything that ChNN teaches in SMS he also teaches in other contexts. SMS was originally designed for teacher training -- and is a comprehensive approach to the various systems found in Dzogchen. 

Also, his longsal cycle is a completely different -- and is not connected with SMS at all.

Yes, that is true. I just try to translate the text as accurately as I can, taking the meaning into account first. Thus, when I see a term like sang rgyas I just translate it as Buddha, buddhahood, etc. without making too much judgment unless there is a play on words in the text. 

Actually for all the recent sturm and drung about this and that "view" of mine, I really try very hard to be as transparent in my translations as possible. Of course, you are right, I have to make choices, but I hope that my choices based on my 23 years as a Dharma practitioner are informed primarily by my practice of these teachings. To be honest, the greatest single thing that changed the way I linguistically looked at Dzogchen texts in particular was studying Tibetan Medicine. Dzogchen language, like the language of medicine is not static, it is dynamic, process-oriented, where as the language of Madhyamaka, Abhidharma, etc., is very static. 

One thing people forget is that there is a close connection with Dzogchen and Tibetan doctors. Even Chetsun Senge Wangchuk was a doctor, and many great tertons, like Rigdzin Godem, Rigzin Jatson Nyingpo, Kongtrul, Khyentse, etc., were skilled physicians.

This is the best way for a Dzogchen pracitioner, in my opinion: my teacher and I have the same state. His/er job is to show me that state and s/he can do that because they are a further along the path than I.

Well you and I both know that the very few people actually read these texts, like Astus (and me, etc.), tend to cherry pick them to make their points. My consideration here is simply to point out to Astus that his citations come from a part of the sutra found only in Chinese sources.

Therefore, they have little bearing on the essential subject of this thread, as I understand it i.e. the presence of a Buddhist eternalism in India. So I suspect we are not having the same conversation.

The point is that part of the sutra under question, which "normalizes" the view of the MPNS does not seem to be present in any other recension. It certainly is not in the Tibetan version.  Based in that, we can consider that the original Tathagatagarbha theory was fully eternalist.

If you are interested, you should check out Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, my teacher. He does many free and open webcasts every year. Open does not mean "less profound". Usually, when something is restricted, it is less profound, and more connected with Vajrayāna methods rather than pure Dzogchen. 

This is the best thing. 

Otherwise, the best thing I can say is: that direct experience is based on direct introduction by a qualified teacher (These days most Dzogchen teachers will be very interested in having you sign on as a Buddhist, but not ChNN). Having received direct introduction, then there are many methods to come to be free of doubt about one's primordial state. Once one is free of doubt, one ceases to worry about buddhahood that is a result of practice and effort, since it does not exist.

Around the world, in every religion, people are moving in a more fundamentalist direction. Yes, also in Buddhism. So, since you were perceived to be a threat by a minor league self-appointed Nyingma Taliban, they issued a fatwa against you which is apparently still in force. Rather than admit they made have been mistaken, they have no choice but to continue to harass you. So now you are the subject of a holy jihad.  This is characteristic of the religious mentality. It is not a characteristic of the yogic or spiritual mentality. And converts to a religion, you will recall, are usually far more zealous in the prosecution of their new faith (embarassingly so) than people raised in it.

One direct transmission, followed by diligence in application of practice is all you need. Of course some people become transmission junkies searching for something they don't know they are "holding in their hands".

Your statement about the Tathagatagabha sutras is the polished and revisionist Madhyamaka/Yogacara version of Tgarbha theory.

Unlike Madhyamaka [PP sutras] and Yogacara [yogacara sutras] there are no surviving independent treatises which do not belong to either of the aforementioned schools on Tgarbha theory. Tgarbha theory too is arguably much earlier than Yogacara. And the gzhan stong of Dolbuba is fully as eternlist as he is accused of being. Just saying...

However, in Dzogchen we do have the metaphor of the Garuda, who develops his ability to fly while still in the egg.

Not really making that claim -- but what I am saying is that in most people their personal evolution is not something they usually wear on their sleeve.

Hi Kalsang:

I took refuge in May, 1989 with HH Sakya Trizin. 

My first direct encounter with Dzogchen teachings was in 1990 when I attended a lecture on Rushan from Tri Yeshe Lama -- I didn't understand anything. 

Then in 1992 I recevied the Guuhyagarbha empowerment from Bakha Tulku and the explanation of the Rongzom's commentary on that tantra from him. I met Chogyal Namkahi Norbu in that year too and attended a retreat with him that year and in 1993 (klong sde). I also met Khenpo Jigphun in 1993 and received from him his complete Manjushri Dzogchen cycle, the Khandro Nyinghthig wang, and the transmission for the Chetsun Nyingthig. I practiced the latter for some time while in my three year retreat. 

When I got out of my three retreat I more or less gave up all formal sadhana practice apart from Tregchö for some years apart from receiving the Nyingma Kama transmissions from Penor Rinpoche in 1998 and the explanation of the Buddha in the Palm of Your Hand Ngondro cycle. 

In 2001 I met Taklung Tsetrul Rinoche and received his permission to read and translate the five volumes of the Gongpa Zangthal teachings. I also met Kunzang Dechen Lingpa in that year.

In 2002, I met Chogyal Namkhai Norbu again.

At the end of 2002 I received the Nyingthig Yazhi from KDL, and continued to receive many teachings from him in 2004 and 2005 including most of his termas and complete tregchö&nbsp;and thögal from him. 

In 2006, 2007, and 2008, I received more instructions on Man ngag sde from Kunzang Dechen's Lingpa's son, Ridzin Dorje. 

During this time I was also receiving regular teachings from ChNN, as well as studying to become a doctor of Tibetan Medicine (2005-2009). 

It is funny, people often think I am a Sakya, but in fact I have received more Dzogchen teachings than I have received sadhana instruction, or sutrayāna instruction apart from my early days with the Sakaya school and my three year retreat in Sakya. The main Sakya teachings I have received are Tsembupa Chenrezi cycle, Lamdre Tsogshad, and the Vajrayogini Lobshad cycles, and that's it. I have received far more Nyingma teachings than Sakya ones, so it is a little bizzare when people call me a Sakyapa. Of course, I have a title from Sakya, i.e. Acarya based on mostly on my mastery of Tibetan, three year retreat and early course work, Abhidharma and so on and the fact that I have helped Lama Migmar Tseten over the years in many ways. But I am no Geshe, and I am not nearly as well educated as some people assume I am. What I am is an aggressive reader. 

So, in fact, when you add it all together, I have received more Dzogchen teachings than any other kind of teaching, and that history goes back for more than 20 years. Not only that, but I had dreams about ChNN in 1987-8, before I ever took refuge. 

When I decided I was a Buddhist, it was because I was standing in the rain listening to a group of Japanese woman recite the heart sutra on Hiezan near Kyoto in the summer of 1986. Up to that point I was a musician (fiddle, guitar, bass, early electronica). 

So, just so you understand I have been devoting myself to Dzogchen practice for 20 years now self-consciously. Of course, there have been over the years a lot of turmoil in my understanding because my early three years in Sakya and my former drive for orthodox understanding caused inner conflict. Howeer, in the end my love of the Dzogchen teachings and personal value of them for me won out. I happen to be good at tenet systems and have a good memory so it used to fun to debate in a polemical way. 

But now I find it heart wrenching and very wrong headed. We live in a world where the five poisons fill not just our minds, but where they are expressed in our very environment, in the way the five elements are in conflcit with one another. But of course there is also beauty too, for as I sit writing this, the lovely scent of our Kazanalik roses waft in through my library window. 

We cannot do anything about the cycle of living and dying, the fact that we are all food for each other, but we can, through tolerance, natural compassion, and mutual recognition of each other's humanity transcend these divisions that so alienate us from each other, that cause us to split in religion, sect, and tribe and conduct war with other, denying one another our basic humanity through objectifying those who do not understand what we thing we understand as "other". 

There are no others. All beings are our reflection; through all beings we find ourselves, and see our own faces. And when we meet a master, or two, or three, or more, we have a chance to see our real face. Having seen that real face, how can we deny that to others. Our real face is not white, black, red, yellow. It is not Buddhist, non-Buddhist, or something in between. When we have seen our own real face, then we will see the real face of all others and all of these petty differences just melt. 

Please don't think I have had some sudden epiphany -- these thoughts I am expressing have come about through a long process of tempering, heated through hearing, sharpened through meditation and polished through prajñā-- but in the forging of a practitioner is nothing that ever reaches completion until total realization. 

In the Samurai tradition, there is a concept of the life-giving sword -- I would like to think of Dharma the same way. When Buddhadhama is wielded polemically, to enforce a view, or a postion, or a policy, or a political stance, it too can be just as destructive as a sword wrongly wielded. And in this I am as guilty as any petty sectarian scholar, since I have been petty sectarian scholar for many years. The sword of Dharma should never be drawn lightly. The sword of Dharma should only be drawn to preserve life, to draw people together, who see its highly polished glint and look at it with awe rather than fear. When the sword of Dharma is unsheathed, the scent of attar of rose should fill the air, not blood. 

So you see, for me, I have no interest anymore in sectarian buddhism that characterizes so much of "buddhist discourse" over the centuries. The siddha movement in late medieval India was non-sectarian -- it produced two main heirs, the Vajrayāna tradition of Tibet and the Natha Sampradaya, as well as other offshoots. "Non-Buddhist" bards call the Bauls in Bengal still sing the Dohas contained in the Caryagiti. Some people think Vajrayāna disappeared into India. Nothing could be further from the truth. India and its outlying regions such as Oḍḍiyāna have been the garden for the many spiritual movements. They sprout, they flourish, they fruit, they are harvested, and in the end they are ploughed back into the soil to provide nourishment for furture spiritual movements. Occasionally, strains escaped from India, and flourished in Isolation. Dzogchen is just one such movement. Mahāyāna another. 

I have spent the last 20 years devoting almost my whole life to Buddhist texts, and in particular Dzogchen texts. Everything I have studied or read was somehow related to my practice, even my working stuff out as a sectarian jerk (which people still accuse me of) was related somehow to my practice. I have come to the point in my understanding where I clearly see that all these sectarian divisions of this relgion and that relgion are negative. Not in the sense that we should not all pursue a spiritual path that is pleasing to us (right now mine is smelling roses, listening to music and typing this post), but in the sense we should be kind and generous about others spiritual paths. Dont get me wrong, I am not saying put on rose-colored spectacles and ignore for example that in the past there have been grave injustices met out to many peoples in the name of religion, the misdeeds of institutional religion in all its forms. We can recognize these and then move on. 

Humanity needs to move into post-religious, post-tribal phase where we meet each other with respect and decency. I am trying my best to meet all of you here on Dwheel from that point of view, and I also fail, will fail, have failed, and for that I am sorry. But my deepest wish is that we can all just get past all divisive nonsense and focus on what is truly important. It's a process, and no one gets it right the first time.

It states: "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1."[2][3] In other words, Godwin observed that, given enough time, in any online discussion—regardless of topic or scope—someone inevitably makes some comparison to Hitler and the Nazis.

And:

There are many corollaries to Godwin's law, some considered more canonical (by being adopted by Godwin himself)[3] than others.[1] For example, there is a tradition in many newsgroups and other Internet discussion forums that once such a comparison is made, the thread is finished and whoever mentioned the Nazis has automatically lost whatever debate was in progress.[8] This principle is itself frequently referred to as Godwin's law. It is considered poor form to raise such a comparison arbitrarily with the motive of ending the thread. There is a widely recognized corollary that any such ulterior-motive invocation of Godwin's law will be unsuccessful.[9]

And:

Some have called for Godwin's law to be renamed Beck's law because of the numerous allusions to Nazi Germany by talk show host Glenn Beck.[16] The Washington Post tallied 202 mentions of Nazis or Nazism, according to transcripts, 147 mentions of Hitler, 193 uses of "fascism" or "fascist," and another 24 mentions of Joseph Goebbels, all within 18 months. Media Matters used these facts to assert Godwin's Law is no longer relegated to chat rooms but now applies to cable news and other media outlets.[17]

Noithing of course. But because I decided once and for all to depart from the mask I have maitained for years as an orthodox Buddhist polemicist, people are understandably puzzled, critical, or disbelieving. 

Once people have fixed you in their minds, if you do not satisfy their criteria of you, they generally become critical. For example, when I originally defended meat-eating on E-Sangha, some people supported that, others did not. When I went through a phase of having personal issues with eating meat, and discussed it, some people supported it, others did not. When I reversed my thinking about it once and for all, some of the people who supported me in my meat-critical phase were understandably puzzled at my reversal of perspective. 

Now, some people are do not like the fact that as far as I am concerned, "Buddhism" is just another limitation. They do not like the fact that I am not holding some sacred place for Buddhism over against non-Buddhist religions. They think that this is some sudden shift on my part. But had they really been paying attention to my posts over the years they would have noted my gradual evolution away from "Buddhism" per se. 

They have not understood my basic point at all: 
...when you have received direct introduction, and are diligently applying the practice of Dzogchen, it does not matter at all what you beleive while you are not practicing, it does not matter what your intellectual view is. Dzogchen view is not an intellectual posture, it is a personal experience of instant presence, and no amount of "correct" Buddhist thinking will lead you to that personal experience of your primordial state, and no amount of "incorrect" non-Buddhist thinking will prevent you from having that personal experience of your primordial state if you diligently apply the teaching in practice having received direct introduction.

People seem not to realize that this is precisely what is stated in many Dzogchen tantras and upadeshas.

Dzogchen definitely has an Indian/Oḍḍiyāna origin. Guhyagarbha proves it. 

If you wish to refrain from judging whether seventeen tantras, etc., are native Tibetan compositions or not, I can understand this. There are certainly a lot of reasons to suspect that they are, or if they are actually translations then they are very free translations. factually speaking, no one has done enough work on the 17 tantra to know for sure. to identify layers of composition etc. 

I can tell you from my research they are very homogenous, and seem to composed by a single author or small group. Some sections read like translations from an Indic language, other sections read like straight up Tibetan. My guess honestly is that they are mixture of both.

In any event, you can just keep assuming that your point of view is right util you decide differently. For example, last night I had a discussion with an SMS teacher, and he felt there was no problem at all in including Jesus in your refuge tree. 

I used to be like you, a True Buddhist(tm) member of Dzogchen Community and  always had (minor) arguments with people who did share your (and my former) POV. I gave it up because my former view (your present view) and Rinpoches teachings on these issues do not correspond. There are very few people I know in the community that have your POV. But it is ok, I respect it even if I don't agree with it for many reasons, not least of which is that I read TIbetan fluently and have access to the originals. 

But I did not give up my former POV based on ChNN's say so. I gave it up because I personally understood that all this stuff which is so important to you, dronma, magnus, adamantine, greg and kalsang yungdrung was completely extraneous to the teachings.

This is why I abandoned my sutra studies for Medicine. Medicine is useful, Dogchen is useful -- the rest of it is not so useful. Someday the Dzogchen tantras and texts like Khandro Nyingthig will be available and people will be able to focus on Dzogchen teachings alone.

Oh, thought you knew your Dzogchen history better. There was only one copy of the Dzogchen tantras, according to the traditional accounts and it existed at Nalanda. When the Nalanda panditas, hostile to Dzogchen already (they didn't very much like all this talk about a result without a cause, a buddhahood that does not come from mind, and an upadesha that is not based on citations), heard that Vimala had been invited to Tibet, they dispatched with him the last remaining copies of the Dzogchen tantras in India and Dzogchen vanished forever from the Indian Subcontinent thenceforth. So it is absolutely correct to observe that Dzogchen disappeared from India due to Buddhist hostility against Dzogchen teachings.

There are another Nath, by the name of Vajranatha, who in the 15th century taught Drikung Rinchen Phunstok as well as Khyentse Wangchuck an important collection of teachings which continues in both Sakya and Drikung. The demise of Vajrayāna in India is greatly overstated. In fact Kunnu Lama recounts meeting sadhus who were Cakrasamvara practitioners in the 1930s when he was in Varanasi.

The question is who in the past 1000 years has been a great Dzogchen master who was not Tibetan. The answer is that due to Buddhist hostility against Dzogchen teachings, Dzogchen completlety died out in India. It was preserved in Tibet by Tibetans. So only Tibetans have been great Dzogchen masters for many centuries.

He was educated at the Kadampa University, Sangphu. 

Other texts such as the yod bzhin mdzod and the grub mtha' mdzod are mainly polemical defenses of Dzogchen trying to site it within the nine yānas scheme. 

Texts such as the tshig don mdzod, chos dbyings mdzod, theg mchog mdzod, and the gnas lugs mdzod however present Dzogchen itself in and of itself, as an independent vehicle.

"Timeless awareness" is a translator's gloss of the term ye shes. You cannot understand Dzogchen without understand the terms and a bit of tibetan grammer. These are the various ways this term has been translated:

ye shes - jnana, (exalted, primordial) wisdom, (primal, transcending, original, unitary, authentic, pure, absolute, a priori, genuine, spiritual, ever-fresh, pristine) awareness, wakefulness, pristine cognition, mystic illumination, gnosis, understanding by peak experience, (intuitive, transcending, comprehensive, true) knowledge, SA mched pa'i ye shes, mnyam nyid ye shes, me long ye shes, chos dbyings ye shes, bya sgrub ye shes, sor rtog ye shes, perfect absolute divine wisdom, pristine wisdom, primordial awareness, timeless awareness

Since the brain is made of five elements, it too is made of the five wisdoms (ye shes) of vidyā. Therefore, there is no problem with awareness, etc., having a basis in the body. Actually, what we say in Dzogchen is that the wisdom of vidyā is located in the heart, the energy of vidyā is located in the brain, where it governs sense organs and cognitions.

Not all nirmanakāya buddhas teach Vajrayāna, let alone Dzogchen. Not all buddhas teach a Vinaya and establish a monastic Sangha (such as Sikhin). Not all buddhas teach Mahāyāna. All nirmanakayā budhas are the same in terms of realization -- but their teachings, retinue, place, and time are all different. For example, when the buddha of hell manifests for hell beings, I am sure he is not teaching them Dzogchen.

Ok, first of all. If you were never a Christian, or a Hindu, or never took teachings from such a master, for example, Hatha Yoga, Ayurveda, etc., then there is no need. But if you have taken teachings from such people, then you can carry this into your Ati Guru Yoga. 

When we do refuge in the DC -- we generally do not do an elaborate refuge tree visualization, we do the One Jewel Unifies All system, so the principle is still the same. 

It is not about including Jesus, Mohammed and so on in some imaginary refuge tree; it is about honoring the sources of all of our spritual knowledge, so the idea is completely different. It is about honoring all of our teachers, no matter what Dharma tradition they come from in the nine yānas. All Yānas belong to Samantabhadra, including the so called samsaric ones. This is the principle that is in play here. The Rigpa Rangshar states:

Though my yānas are inconceivable, when summarized,
they are included in two, samsara and nirvana

This means that all Dharma systems, "Buddhist" and "Non-Buddhist" are vehicles of Samantabhadra. If you have a connection with any of them, you unify them through the principle of Guru Yoga and go beyond limitations.

Now, if we follow your logic here, since Hinduism, Christianity, etc., is part of the nine yānas too, and since the next seven are the vehicles that normally characterize "buddhism" it then follows that "Buddhism" and "Non-buddhism" cannot be separated either, and it therefore also follows we cannot separate Dzogchen from these non-buddhist religions as well. 

But it is not like this. "Yāna" means vehicle. It carries you somewhere. Where? In this case, to liberation. The nine yānas are not a progressive program where you train in one yāna and then move onto the next one, like changing trains at a station or like a system of grades in a school. 

Each yāna is an independent method for liberation, some are direct, like Dzogchen, some are very indirect, like the vehicle of gods and men. The rest are in the middle. So each yāna and also Dzogchen are independent vehicles. It is also the same with the three yāna scheme. One does not need to train in Hinayāna to enter Mahāyāna. One does not need to train in Mahāyāna to enter Vajrayāna. Each of these three vehicles of a complete conveyance for liberation. The idea common in Tibetan Buddhism that you need to stack up the three yānas, in terms of the three vows, or progress through the three yānas as a gradual training. But this is not an exclusive approach. One can also enter Vajrayāna immediately. 

Dzogchen can also be practiced as an intimate instruction for mahāyoga and anuyoga. So, there are two ways to approach Dzogchen -- as a completely independent vehicle, which in general is the approach of ChNN, KDL, etc., or as an intimate instruction for the inner tantras, the usual approach of the Nyingma school.

What Sonam means is that when we do Guru Yoga we can unify all knowledge and masters into Guru Yoga including the knowledge we might have learned from non-Buddhist masters. This is quite different from saying we can use non-Buddhist masters for Dzogchen Guru Yoga. The point is that non-buddhist traditions are included in the first Yāna i.e. the vehicle of gods and humans. That is all Sonam means. The point, as I have understood it since 1992, is that one unifies all knowledge into the state of Guru Yoga.

You are inferring from the fact that ChNN and Khyentse Yeshe are tulkus that Dzogchen Community is a traditional institution? A Tibean styled one? 

That is a pretty thin inference, Greg, even you can see that, I hope. 

Sometime you should buy a copy of this book:

THE DZOGCHEN COMMUNITY: PRINCIPLES AND GUIDELINES.

It establishes the DC as a society based on the principles of mutual respect and collaboration between practitioners with a common aim. That is the key word "Collaboration". You can read about ChNN's vision of the Dzogchen Community in The Song of the Vajra, ppg. 105-114. 

So someone like you, who may appreciate ChNN and his teachings, has your own comittments and your own path. You have no real idea about the internal life of Dzogchen Community and our values.

He is just pissed because I am tired of the hierarchical bullshit that is so integral to Tibetan Buddhism and am open about it. He is mad because I have over the years made it absolutely clear that I disdain the tulku system as a mere money game, and so on. He is mad because I don't respect the system -- and I don't. Of course, lotuses grow in swamps, and likewise, there are mavelous persons who have come out of that system, or rather, despite it. I also don't share the sort of lame "anti-science" rhetoric he is into dereived in large part from the late Thrinly Norbu Rinpoche. He brought it up earlier in this thread and it is never far from his lips in these discussions. Now, I understand why he is into it, since TNR is one his gurus, but I don't find it TNR's arguments very compelling at all, and I am far from a "new athiest" of the Dawkins and Harris variety. Indeed, recently, Adamantine compared me with Batchelor, as if I had abandoned the notion of rebirth. So he is clearly approaching me from some ideological bent that I honestly can't relate to.

You need to study more history of Tibetan Buddhism. 

For example, Ngagpa Yeshe Dorje told me never to go to Dharamsala because it was filled with evil people. He was beaten within an inch of his life for no reason on Losar in the mid 80's. 

The good things about Tibetan culture and the Dharma do not cancel out the negative side of Tibetan religious politics. We spend a lot of time being involved in Tibetan internecine conflicts we are completely unaware of. I have heard Nyingma students proclaim "If your view of emptiness is Gelug, you will never be able to practice Dzogchen...." oblivious to the fact that both Shabkar and Jigme Lingpa favored Tsongkhapa's view of Madhyamaka. It just goes on and on. There is a certain bliss in ignorance, but I am too knowledable about controversie and issues in Tibetan Buddhism to be blind to the fact that they form a certain patterns. 

The strongest critics of Tibetan culture are Tibetans themselves, people like Milarepa, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen, Drukpa Kunly, Patrul and others who were not blind to the problems of the institutional culture of Tibetan Buddhism. Of course, if they say things, they are heralded as great saints, but if I make the same observations I am accused of being a Trimondi. Honestly, what nonesense.

But everyone who sincerely dedicates themselves to Dzogchen, having had the fortune to meet the full teachings will awaken in the bardo -- or at minimum they will spend 500 years in the pure nirmanakāya buddhafields before acheiving total realization. This is guaranteed as long as you understand the teachings. The third statement of Garab Dorje, literally translated means "continue in the confidence of liberation" -- this does not mean of course you are totally realized. It means you know the true meaning of liberation and are certain of acheiving it, so you "...continue in that state".

That is not true -- I provided you with the reference for the Vigrahavyavartani and suggested you read it. There is a very readable translation by E.H Johnston.

Candra rejects pramāṇa when it comes to emptiness, accepting consequences as sufficient to show emptiness. He does not reject pramāṇa in every case, however, when he accepts that we can infer first stage bodhisattas through their compassionate deeds. 

When I said Madyamakas reject "logic", I meant that they reject pramāṇa as being a meaningful path to ultimate truth. That is all I meant. Pramāṇa is a useful worldly science -- but as Rongzom states in his Introduction To The Principles of Mahāyāna (which I have incidentally translated completely, but it is unedited), "If one could reach the ends of objects of knowledge with a single flawless reasoning, for what reason was it not demonstrated in all the transmissions of the victors to begin with?"

Yes, there is no class of indigent mendicants who have an excuse not support themselves in the DC. This alone makes it a very different proposition. I know a Lama who won't visit India, at least not where there are any monasteries because if he feels required to bring a minimum of $10,000 merely to make tea offerings. 

I mean, fine, this is Tibetan culture, and I am not judging Tibetan culture on its own merits. But this is completely at odds with Western culture. 

But the above is not, as far as I can tell, what the Buddha intended for his Sangha of monks. Heck, one of the reasons Ashoka cracked down on the Bhikṣu Sangha and purged tens of thousands of monks from the ranks of bhikṣus is that within 150 years the Bhikṣu Sangha had become a haven for all kinds of negative people. 

Poor Langdarma was murdered because he wanted to tax the monasteries, so the revisionists who rewrote the history of Imperial era cast him as a Dharma destroyer. Actually, a better read is that he saw the monasteries as an economic drain on the people and wanted to rein it in. For that he was murdered even though he has a Buddhist and wrote Buddhist texts, as the Tunhuang documents prove.

Dzogchen Community is an autarchy. It is self-governed. All practitioners are equal. We all have the same state. We are working toward the same goal. Some of us are further along, like ChNN, some of us are not, like me. But in the DC all practitioners are equal, we all have the same state. 

In my opinion, in Buddhism the insitutions have become more important than the people. Actually, it has been this way for centuries -- Buddhist Institutions have functioned to support a priviledged elite in a very feudal manner. Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism, is an oligarchy. Tibean Buddhism functions based on a system of vassalage and fealty. It is actually the same in other Buddhist cultures as well. The reason for this has to do with the way Buddhism has adapted itself for the past 2300 years to various aristocracies. 

I used to think that since democracy and Buddhism were not compatible, we needed to subordinate ourselves to hierarchy of monks, lamas, tulkus, etc because it was necessary for the survival of the Dharma, because they supposedly represented the work of the Dharma in the world. I no longer believe that. There is way too much corruption, greed, abuse, and lust for power, title and position in Tibetan Buddhism and in Buddhism in general. There are way too many Lamas who abuse the Dharma to control people, to control scandals, to extort money from their students, etc. This completely wrong. But I have seen that Tibetan Buddhist institutions run on cash. It is all about the money. Everytime Lamas come here they are putting out the plate for donations. Of course, they have to, because they are expected to, it is their job. But frankly, I am fatigued by it. I could go on and on about my gripes about the way Tibetan Buddhism. Perhaps I have just seen one corrupt lama too many. 

I am not saying that there are no good monks, nuns, lamas, khenpos and tulkus, genuinely spiritual people who mean nothing but the best for everyone. Of course there are. Not all catholic preists are pedarests either. But I am pretty toasted on the worldy ambitions of Tibetan Buddhism. 

I do not beleive that traditional Buddhism is in any way capable of addressing the problems we face in the world today. I am sure that it was never capable of addressing these issues. I regard the Shambhala vision of an enlightened society to be a total fantasy, and I regard Thurman's call for a rule of Buddhist philosopher kings a farce -- it completely failed in Tibet, from the beginning. Since it failed there, it will not succeed here.

The only way we can solve the problems we have in the word today is to put down our socio/religious/culture banners. We must be like Angulimala -- we must stop. If we human beings cannot get along as one human family, there will be no chance for Dharma let alone Buddhism, no anything -- just war, famine, sickness and death.

Guys -- it is really not hard to understand: Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is not a Nyingmapa, though all the Nyingmapas think he is. He is not a Sakyapa, though all the Sakyapas, think he is; he is not a Drugpa Kagyu, though all the Drukpa Kagyus think he is; He is not a Bonpo, though all the Gelugpas think he is.

He is a nominally a Buddhist in name, because he was raised in a Buddhist culture and Buddhist monastery -- and no one ever said otherwise. But he has also said explicitly he is not a Buddhist, nor a Bonpo. "Buddhist", Bonpo, Hindu, Christian, etc. are cultural identification -- but Dzogchen is beyond culture. 

So what is he really? A Dzogchen practitioner who has integrated the meaning of Dzogchen into his life as completely as he can.

No, it means that Ati Gury Yoga is the center of DC practice. The center of DC practice is not the thun book. You know, every retreat ChNN's holds up the thun book and says "Some people think this is Dzogchen practice -- this is not Dzogchen practice." There used to be a book called Dzogchen Ritual Practices. A nice book, very useful. Because people misunderstood, the book was swiftly discontinued and has now been out of print for twenty years. 

Theoretically can be a DC practitioner and never practice a single deity their whole life. Of course, that would be a silly limitation, because sometimes it is useful to use a method of transformation. But transformation is not Atiyoga. In atiyoga,as taught by ChNN there is nothing to transform, no vows to take, no daily practice other than a commitment to discover your real nature through atiyoga -- hence the reason working with the transmission with ati guru yoga is indispensible.

I know very well what he was saying I have heard him say it a gazillion times. Sakyapas and Gelugpas do not accept direct introduction as an independent method (The Gelugpas negate it completely, Sakyas accept it only after one has received a major empowerment -- like ChNN I was educated in the Sakya system). Therefore, he was saying that you should not go to a Sakya or Gelug Lama and tell them that you have received direct introduction because they might negate you. 

But in fact Sakya and Gelug Lamas know this perfectly well. 

So, saying "Dzogchen is based on direct introduction, not tantric intitiation" is a perfectly acceptable thing to say when someone asks you "What is the difference between the method of entering Dzogchen teachings and Vajrayāna."

Just out of curiosity, just how long have you been a student of ChNN? Beyond that, you follow your conscience, I will follow mine, deal?

Apparently not since you insult their intelligence at every turn and tell them that what they have heard that have not heard, what they have seen, they have not seen. It is actually you who are insisting that DC people are children, and not the other way around. 

Anyway:

"First of all, when you take a a Tantric Initiation, you're given a water to drink. And this is called the water of one's vows, of one's promises. When you drink that water you've taken a kind of oath. You've sworn to follow that which you are about to commit yourself to. Many people do not know all this and collect hundreds of of different initiations. If one does this and then does nothing about these commitments, far from having done yourself good, what you have done is created obstacles and impediments for yourself. 

What do you have to do? You have to maintain the transmission. If you're a practitioner of Dzogchen and understand the principle involved, and you don't remain in some boxed-in limited conditions, you can for all of these commitments made carry them to the level of Guruyoga. Whatever transmissions you have received, you can take them to the level of their unification,and at that level practice the Guruyoga. In such a case it all becomes positive. That is to say, you're acting to deepen and develop all these transmissions you have received. 

You have to remember that this is the way of seeing of a Dzogchen practitioner. If one lives limited and boxed in to some level of teaching, then that's not the case for you. But you have to therefore understand and see through the limits of the traditions and systems. 

Talks in OZ, 1982 ppg 171-172

As far as I can tell, you are very interested in keeping people in boxes of your own contrivance.

Another misrepresentation. The question was "Can Ati Guru Yoga received from ChNN maintain your comittments to previously taken tantric practice commitments, etc." The answer, for those people who do not have wax in their ears and cobwebs in their eyes, YES! 


Ati Guru Yoga is not just a method of maintaining commitments, no on said that it was. It is a method of discovering your instant presence, a supreme method, more important than many others. If you need help, more assistance, then you add Song of the Vajra. The point is not to remain complacent -- and if you think that is what I was saying you really are very wrong. 

I don't even know who you are or if ChNN is your main teacher or what. But if he is, I am amazed that you do not understand the principle here. If not, then I can understand why you are out of step with our understanding. 

Still, you should know better than to sow doubts in people's minds when they ask honest questions. This person, Inge said she could not relate to the practice she had received. She wanted to know a simple answer. She received it according to the principles that ChNN has been enuciating for years. If you are folloing his teaching, you should integrate all your transmissions and teachings into Guru Yoga of one of three styles, Ati, Anu, or Mahā -- your choice. That's it -- it is really simple. No one was advocating complacency or indifference to samaya or anything else -- so it is egregious that you, gabbana, have created such a mispresentation. 

If people are offended because I said she did not have to go back to her former teacher and "give back" her practice commitment -- tough. Too goddamn bad. It is not necessary.

When one receives an initiation, for example, one promises to carry out the transformation practice daily, reciting the corresponding mantra at least three or seven times. On top of this commitment, there are also many other related samaya which must be observed. But in Dzogchen the only samaya involved is to find oneself in the condition of "what is," as it is. All the rest, that is to say all the judgments and creations of the mind, all our limits, and so on, all these are false and superfluous.

These are not sources. This is just hearsay. A source would be, for example, a clear statement from some tantra, etc. Since no such rite exists, however, you will not be able to provide such a source.

When one receives an initiation, for example, one promises to carry out the transformation practice daily, reciting the corresponding mantra at least three or seven times. On top of this commitment, there are also many other related samaya which must be observed. But in Dzogchen the only samaya involved is to find oneself in the condition of "what is," as it is. All the rest, that is to say all the judgments and creations of the mind, all our limits, and so on, all these are false and superfluous.

This is all nice, but in reality it is just so much conceptual proliferation. Commitments are connected with a path. If you decide you are not going to follow that path, then what is the point of maintaining commitments to a path one is not following? None.

The notion of daily practice commitments comes from lower tantras. In Tibet the practice of the three outer tantas has greatly influenced the way higher yoga tantras are practiced. 

Also such things as the shape of the vajra and the bell, etc. You have a mantra, you must recite this everyday. This is completely not in accordance with any principles of Dzoghen teachings. Of course they have their own principles, but there is no Dzogchen tantra anywhere that says "When you receive this empowerment, you must recite this mantra, etc...". 

The question was: is a Dzogchen practitioner required to maintain previous practice comittments they might have received. The answer is you can unify all comittments into Guru Yoga, and no, you do not have to recite every mantra that came with a lifetime practice comitment because that idea is a from lower tantra, which includes maha and anu.

It is really amazing how persistant and wrongheaded your mischaracterizations are. 

I never stated anywhere that there was at present a lineage of Dzogchen that existed outside the container of the religions known as Buddhism and Bon. 

What I said was that in order to practice Dzogchen one does not have to sign up and become a Buddhist or a Bonpo. Two entirely different statements.

No, that is not true. For human beings, there is no hell realm, not deva realm, no ghost realm: when is the last time you saw any types of sentient being that was not a human or an animal? 

When you have the experience of a hell being, you will not have any awareness of human beings, devas, etc.

The six lokas are merely potentialities in our bodyminds. Right now that potentiality is expressing itself as the human realm. The six lokas are not external realities that exist side by side like six bookshelves which have books on devas, asuras, humans, animals, pretas and hell beings.

To put it another way -- ignorance can experience itself as any of the six lokas. This does not say anything about some "objective" or "relative" existence of the six lokas.

It may be convenient for someone to believe in the relative existence of the six lokas, but it is pretty hard to defend the existence fo the six lokas as anything more than the expression of traces. And when we are not expressing those traces those realms do not "externally" exist for us in any way.

Dzogchen practice does not depend on a literal belief in the six lokas. It depends on the understanding that the ignorant mind can generate all false appearances because of not percieving our true condition. Six lokas practice merely eliminates the traces for those false appearances. For example, for us, there is no hell. We do not perceive hell, hell is outside our experential range. For us hell is completely false. For a hell being, the human realm is completely false. The root of both is an ignorant mind that has traces to produce those experiences. We do not need to imagine the six lokas exist anywhere other than in our own bodyminds. 

But I did not advance Dzogchen as radical empiricism. The Dzogchen proposition that our experience of sentient beings and the world is a misperception of radiant wisdom light is sufficient to put an end the idea that it is. 

However, the essential point in Dzogchen teachings is direct introduction and an experience of instant presence. That does not depend on any belief at all other than desire to come to recognize one's real state. 

Considering that the body of light is a commonly advanced desiderata of Dzogchen practice, it is difficult to be a radical empiricist ala Batchelor, Dawkings and Harris and practice Dzogchen. 

Lets say we decide to take ChNN's theory of the origin of ZZNG as being the correct theory. There is no evidence in what scholars consider to be "early Bon" that the Bonpos had a theory of rebirth that corresponds to the Pan-Indian cultural idea of the six lokas. But they had Dzogchen. Later, when the Dzogchen lineage of Garab Dorje entered Tibet, the Bonpos adopted a number of ideas from the adoption of Buddhism including the bardo, six lokas, and so on. 

So, there are number of angles we can approach this from without having necessarily adopt scientific atheism as our view.

Well, anyone can see they have five afflictions. So if they understand the six lokas as being metaphors for the six afflictive states, then they can do the practice without beleiving in rebirth. 

In reality there are no six lokas anyway.

Yes I can see it now:

Dear ChNN:

Your student Malcolm says anyone can practice Dzogchen, they do not have to become a Buddhist. He even says Dzogchen is not Buddhist, it goes beyond Buddhism. Is this really true? I really think Malcolm is harming Buddhism and ruining people's paths. I am sure he is going to go to hell for eons, but I just want to make sure that I am right, so I am writing to you to confirm my opinion. He is a really bad person, and is confusing everyone with all this talk of Dzogchen being an independent vehicle, and the fact that you do not have get a Buddhist name to practice Dzogchen. He even says that Dzogchen is a separate lineage in Bon! But we all know that our compassionate Padmasambhava took pity on the poor ignorant Bonpos and manifested as a teacher to till the soil a bit to make them ready to receive the seed of our wonderful true Buddhist Dzogchen(tm). Please write back soon so that I can tell him and everyone else how wrong he is.

Thanks, 

Faithful Buddhist Snitch 

PS It does not matter that he has introduced scores of people to your teachings via webcast via private emails for the past 10 years, he still is a very bad man.

No, of course not. I would have to die in order in order to have that experience and I don't remember the last round. 

But, even if you don't accept rebirth, practicing Dzogchen will help you relax in this life, and if you have experience in this life, then when you find yourself in the bardo, you will know what do to.

'

If a man shoots his dog because the animal is no longer capable of service, he does not fail in his duty to the dog, for the dog cannot judge, but his act is inhuman and damages in himself that humanity which it is his duty to show towards mankind. If he is not to stifle his human feelings, he must practice kindness towards animals, for he who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. 

-- Kant

That the Buddha did not accord animals the same status as humans can be understood from the mere fact that killing animals is an act which requires mere confession with no punishment at all, like drinking alchohol, digging in the earth or plucking the leaves off of trees. For a Buddhist monk, masturbation is considered a more serious offense than killing an animal, requiring not only confession but a form of stringent probation in isolation. Needless to say, killing a human or even a human fetus is a parajika offense which causes one to lose one's vows completely. 

In general, the prohibition against killing for lay people primarily means killing humans, but has been extended to all sentient beings though long and ancient custom as an extension of Ahimsa, formally included in Tibetan Buddhism as a commitment of refuge in the Dharma. But the discussions of killing in Abhidharma, etc., never involve discussions of killing animals, only the murder of human beings. 

The practice of ahimsa is actually separate from the vow of not taking life, since ahimsa extends not only to animals but plants and other features of what we considered the natural environement. Ahimsa is not a vow. Ahimsa is an ethic, a way of life.
