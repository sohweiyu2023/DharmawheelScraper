How can there be something, no matter what noun you want to use, that avoids the two extremes? If there is something that avoids the two extremes, it is an extreme. 

Your use here is an affirming negation. But freedom from extremes is by design a nonaffirming negation. In other words, when one negates existence, nonexistence is not being confirmed. When one negates nonexistence, existence is not being confirmed, and likewise, the same applies to the remaining two extremes. This is the reason why all four extremes are to be negated, not just the first two, otherwise, the fault of being an affirming negation also applies.

The Tibetan text of Mīnapa's story begins by stating that his caste was fisherfolk, his guru was Mahādeva, and his siddhis were mundane siddhis. When you read the story carefully, though it is said he eventually traversed the paths and stages, it does not say that he does so with respect to the instructions he received from Mahādeva. The story is basically charming in its elements. A fisherman gets pulled into the water by a huge fish, and swallowed. Meanwhile, Umadevi is requesting a Dharma teaching from Mahādeva (who as we know, is by now a Buddhist, having been converted by Avalokiteśvara in the Karandavyuha Sūtra, etc. and tamed by Cakrasamvara). Mahādeva says he has a very secret teaching, but it should taught under the ocean, so no on can hear. They repair to their house in the depths of ocean, meanwhile, the fish that has swallowed the fisherman has come to rest below this house, and therefor, the fisherman can hear all that Mahādeva is teaching to Umadevi, who unfortunately falls asleep during the teaching. When Mahādeva realizes that Umadevi was sleeping through the teaching, he looks with the clairvoyance and understands that in the belly of the fish below his house, there is a man. He confers empowerment upon the fish [to empower the man inside it], and the man practices for 12 years in the belly of the fish. The fish is eventually caught, the fisherman is released, and everyone is amazed. The name of the teaching is not mentioned. It is stated Mīnapa, aka Vajrapāda, aka Acinta, works for the benefit of beings for five hundred years. 

In the empowerment text composed by one of the Drukchen's on the basis of the empowerment text by Tārānātha, when Mīnapa, aka Acinta, teaches Gorakṣanātha, the name of a text is mentioned, and it is the text Amṛtasiddhi, which was composed by Brahmin Virupa, who in turn is a disciple of Lakṣminkara. According to Mallinson, Amṛtasiddhi is the Buddhist source text upon which all Hathayoga manuals depend.  

So, all we really can know, from the earliest text we have on the 84 mahāsiddhas, is that Mīnapa achieved mundane siddhis under the tutelage of Mahādeva, and he eventually attained the state of Khecari, and that according to Tārānātha, the text he taught Gorakṣa is the Buddhist ancestor of Hathayoga.

I should add, there are other instances of Buddhist Vajrayāna traditions that are attributed to Shiva, in Lamdre, for example, where it is clarified that Mahādeva is a disciple of Vajradhara in one specific instructional cycle.

It has been thirty-two years since that book was published, and that we have much better informational resources available to us now than we did in 1986, in all areas of historical research on India and Tibet. Dowman's book, in light of modern scholarship, suffers from some anachronisms. It is not a completely reliable guide and one would be wise not to base hard and fast conclusions about the nature of the Mahāsiddhas and their religious affiliations viz. embracing Buddhism and Hinduism together upon his book. Mallinson, as I mentioned, is someone who has spent decades in India studying and practicing yoga, is expert in Sanskrit, and has researched the historical roots of the Naths based on primary material, with reference to the 84 siddhas, and so on. 

For example, in his article, The Original Gorakṣaśataka, he notes that there is no use of the term "Nath" to refer to an order of yogis prior to the 18th century. Thus, there are serious problems with the claim that the mahāsiddhas you mention are "naths."

There is no evidence that the siddhas you mention were Naths, since the earliest mention of all these figures is in Buddhist texts.

I disagree with your conclusion that there IS truly nothing as a consequence of causes and conditions being unfindable upon analysis. All we can say is that causes and conditions appear, when that appearance is subject to analysis, it cannot be found. It does not mean one has destroyed the appearance of causes and conditions. Therefore, it is as wrong to say that "causes and conditions are nothing because they cannot be found on analysis" as it is to say that "causes and conditions are something because there is an appearance to investigate."

No, it is not merely an opinion. There is an entire Madhyamaka literature which definitively refutes the Yogācāra school in terms of citations and reasoning. Not to mention many mentions in the tantras where Yogacāra is relegated to an inferior position. 

With respect to the Jonangpas, they were not banned because of gzhan stong. Jonang was suppressed because they supported the King of Tsang during the war between the King of Tsang and the Ganden Phodrang of the Great Fifth. 

Also, it is an error to assert that east Asian Buddhists are "Yogacārins." Yogācāra is a well understood school in East Asian Buddhism, thanks to Hsuan Tsang, and no one really follows his school. Yogacāra is definitely not considered a definitive position by native Huayen scholars, Tientai scholars, Chan scholars, and so on. 

Interestingly enough, the idea that East Asian Buddhism is unduly influenced by Yogacāra is basically a Gelgupa idea advanced by Thuken and taken up by some western scholars.

In terms of philosophical positions, this assertion (that self-aware clarity is ultimate) does not go beyond Yogacāra. As a consequence, meditating from a perspective that holds that such self-aware clarity is ultimate leads to rebirth in the formless realms at best.

There are structural similarities in the way gzhan stong and Advaita articulate the distinction between ultimate and relative. According to gzhan stong, the ultimate (parinispanna) is empty of all relative phenomena (paratantra and parikalpita), and is utterly distinct from it. Likewise, nirguna brahmin is devoid of māya. In this respect they are structurally similar. KTG admitted this structural similarity, and protested, that nevertheless, there is no buddhahood in Advaita. This conversation was conducted with his translator, Jim Scott, it happened in 1992, so I doubt Scott would remember. 

However, this does not make gzhan stong monistic. My point was quite different.

In some Dzogchen texts, "beginning" refers to putative state prior to the separation of samsara and nirvana. But it is not to be taken too literally. The term ye nas generally forms part of a compound past participle phrase of whatever verb is being used in the sentence. Sometimes it needs to be translated as "primordially," when an adjectival use is indicated.

Some phrases, like ka nas dag pa, for example, are also compound past participle phrases. In general, we can understand such compound past participle phrases as indicating that something is innate. In sutras, one does not find ka nas dag pa, but one does find very frequently gzod ma nas dag pa, which is identical in meaning. This "pure from the beginning" just means "innately pure."

I pretty well aware of the historical context. Shankara went to great lengths to prophylactically reject the ideas that his POV was derived from Mahāyāna, as anyone who has actually read Shankara will know. 

The main claim for Buddhist influence on Shankara comes from the fact that his paramaguru was a guy named Gaudapāda, the fourth chapter of whose Agamaśastra seems to borrow heavily from Madhyamaka and Yogacāra arguments, somewhat indiscriminately, to refute Samkhya and Vaiśesika scholars, and to propose ajativāda. However, given that Shankara does in fact go to great lengths to forestall the criticism of being a crypto-Buddhist, this should perhaps lead us to conclude that he wasn't a crypto-Buddhist,, and that his opponents such as Vijñāna Bhikṣu, Ramanuja, and so on, were all just a bit lazy in their thinking.

I am sorry, I thought you were referring to how the term rang bzhin is used in Dzogchen as opposed to MMK. In this case, the former is prakRti and the latter is svabhAva.

As an aside, when the MMK was first translated into Tibetan in the 8th century, svabhāva was translated as ngo bo nyid.

No, but I do have the benefit of more than three full decades of observing many adult Buddhists and their growing children, and most children of most American Buddhists do not themselves become Buddhists, whether they are encouraged to or not. In fact, what I observe is that the children of those parents who let them just find Buddhism for themselves are the children who stick. The others go the "weird parent" route.

Well, given that Shankara is one of the 60 teachers identified as promulgating wrong view in the Self-Arisen VIdyā Tantra, it would be very surprising to learn of any so called khenpo of Dzogchen claiming that Atman was just a Hindu name for the mind essence. You yourself admit the idea does not even exist in their system.

It is not even slightly debatable. 

Why? If it were the case that diet was a factor in liberation, no one who ate meat would ever have attained liberation, let alone buddhahood, including the Buddha. Since many meat eaters have indeed attained liberation and even buddhahood, it is quite clear that the Buddhist path to liberation has nothing to do with what kind of food one puts in one's mouth.

Bodhisattvas on the impure stages have very strong traces for meeting the Dharma.When they take rebirth, the force of past realization causes them to enter the path and continue up to and beyond the realization they had before. 

Emanations do not forget or need to re-realize anything, and this is also true of eight stage bodhisattvas and beyond. According to one account, a buddha is conscious when they die, in the womb, and during birth; a bodhisattva on the stages is conscious when they die, in the womb, but become unconscious at birth, while sentient beings are unconscious when the die, are in the womb, and at birth.

In Dzogchen texts there are three stages generally described: recognition, realization, and liberation. 

Some people think the third statement means full integration, but it does not.

Continuing in the confidence of liberation means that one has true knowledge of one's primordial state and therefore, with this knowledge, one's liberation is no longer in issue in terms of inevitability, it is only an issue of whether it occurs in this life, the time of death, the bardo, or a natural nirmanakāya buddhafield.

I did not confirm that that Dzogchen emerged "outside" of the creation stage. I confirmed that the  milieu in which Dzogchen arose regarded the creation stage as optional, meaning that it was not necessary for everyone. For whom is the creation stage not necessary, according to those who belonged to this milieu? Those who immediately understood the meaning and were liberation through that understanding. Everyone else was recommended to practice the indirect approach, as Mañjuśṛīmitra states:

Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

"Optional" does not mean deciding that you want salad instead of fries with your burger. "Optional" means that if one does not wake up immediately into full buddhahood through receiving Dzogchen transmissions, there are many practices with which one works with concepts to overcome concepts, like the creation and completion stages, and various other kinds of preliminary practices in Dzogchen such as yogas that work with vāyu, conceptual analysis, and so on. These are options of which the practitioner can avail themselves. BTW, your allergy to conceptual practices is entirely conceptual.

Title: Re: Dzogchen outside of Tantra
Content:
You do not understand the context of Longchenpa's classification system. For example, in the Shing rta chen mo, when he analyzes, mahāyoga, he says: 


The Śṛī Guhysamāja, Mañjuśr̄i Yamantaka, etc. are the yoga tantras called "mahāyoga." These principally teach the creation stage, the aspect of method, and their completion stage is vāyu. Saṃsiddhi (yang dag), Vajrakīlaya, Cakrasamvara, Hevajra, and so on, are wisdom or mother tantras, called "anuyoga." These principally teach the wisdom and the completion stage. Also with respect to the completion stage, since they employ the bindu of the bodhicitta element, they assert [the completion stage to be] the pristine consciousness of nonconceptual bliss and emptiness. The nondual tantras are Mahāmayajala tantras and so on, called "Atiyoga." They principally teach the union of creation and completion, the essence of inseparable method and wisdom. Their completion stage is asserted to be the great pristine consciousness of bliss, clarity, nonconceptuality, and unconceivable luminosity that is arises from nāḍīs, vāyu, and bindu.

We understand that he is classifying the Guhyagarbha within Mahāyoga, because he says:

Within mahāyoga tantras, [mahā] mahā emphasizes vaȳu, the creation stage, and method. [Mahā] anu emphasizes the element, completion stage, and wisdom. [Mahā]ati emphasizes that everythiing is nondual pristine consciousness. Further, all phenmoena are uniform from the start. Practice by recognizing this to be so.

Further, in the Treasury of Philosophical Positions, the five early lungs of translated by Vairocana, the thirteen lungs translated by Vimalamitra, the Kun byed rgyal po, the rmad du byung ba and the mdo bcu are mentioned, but no mention of Guhyagarbha. A number of klong sde tantras are mentioned, and a whole slew of intimate instruction series tantras are mentioned, but there is no mention at all of the Guhyagarbha. With respect to the unsurpassed secret cycle, the seventeen tantras are mentioned, as well as their ancillary literature, but there is no mention of the Guhyagarbha at all. Thus, there is no evidence for you assertion that the Guhyagarbha is to be accepted as an ati ati level tantra, let alone a tantra of the unsurpassed secret cycle. There are a whole number of reasons why this is so, and I am quite sure that Khen Rinpoche would be in accord with my perspective on this, since it is in fact Longchenpa's own perspective.

Further, in the Ngal skor gsum as well as the Treasury of Philosophical Positions, the Vajrasattvamayajala tantras are listed as belonging to the mind tantras that form part of mahāyoga, with the root tantra of all mahāyoga tantras listed as Guhyasamāja. But no where, in any list of atiyoga tantras, apart from the mahā ati division of mahāyoga, is the Guhyagarbha mentioned in any list of tantras. 

Thus, while it is true that Longchenpa wrote his commentary on the Guhyagarbha from the perspective of general Ati yoga on the basis of the Rosary of Views by Guru Rinpoche, and the commentary on the Guhyagarbha authored by Suryasimaphrabha (a very interesting text), he did not consider the text in and of itself a tantra belonging the 6.4 million slokas of the Great Perfection taught by Garab Dorje.

In other words, what is being claimed here is that when Mahāyoga is subdivided, there is mahā mahā, mahā anu, and mahā ati. And within Ati, there is ati mahā; ati anu, and ati ati. 

Clearly, this commentary is commenting from the point of view of the indivisible creation and, with an emphasis on the completion stage. I think you have slightly misunderstood Longchenpa's meaning and purpose here.

It is possible to clarify the lower by means of the higher, but one cannot elevate the lower to the higher.

Because it mentions the five signs, etc., fireflies, butterlamps, etc. 

As for your contention, no, this chapter does not place place the tantra in the unsurpassed secret cycle, and Longchenpa himself would never make such a claim. 

Why? There are two faults here: one, the teaching that the deities exist in the body with faces and hands a) does not go beyond mahāyoga in general; and with respect to the outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed secret cycles, this assertion belongs to the secret cycle, not the unsurpassed secret cycle.

With respect to Rongzom, Longchenpa says his opinion is irrelevant in one place, incorrect in another, and mentions him positively twice, amounting to four mentions, none of this amounts to a serious refutation. Longchenpa's commentary clearly depends on Rongzom's.

Yes, it is a form of oppression. 

The American Revolution did not take place in order to defend slavery as an institution. The vast majority of American soldiers who fought in the Revolution were from New England. 

Attitudes towards slavery in Massachusetts, for example, where quite jaundiced and by 1790 there were no slaves in Massachusetts as a result of case law (Walker v. Jennison and Commonwealth v. Jennison). Slavery was abolished ouright in Vermont in 1777. Connecticut began an emancipation process in 1784. Rhode Island abolished slavery in the 17th century, however the legislation was ignored. However, in 1794, it passed a manumission act which led the eventual ending of slavery in that state. 

The first and second Continental Armies were composed largely of troops from the New England states. It was only in the third Continental Army where each state was required to send one battalion. Ten percent of the Continental Army was freed slaves.

With respect to this, if one agree with the goals of an army, i.e., support the killing in which it engages, one accrues the negative karma of killing one person, times the number of people in the organization. For example, if a mob of 100 lynches someone, everyone in that mob who agrees with and supports the action, where the intent to kill, the object that is the object of affliction (hatred in this instance), the deed itself and satisfaction in the performance of the deed of killing all possess 100 times the karma of one person killing another person. This is true, even if only one person shot the gun or strung the noose. But if one belongs to such a group, but does not agree with and find satisfaction in the commission of acts of killing, then one is free of that karma. In this case then, if one is a cook who is gungho and totally supports the military goals of that army, one accrues the negative karma of each act of killing times the number of people in that army who actively support and are satisfied with such actions. If one is a cook who does not support the acts of killing, but simple prepares food for the troops, then one does not have even one person's negative karma of killing. The same is true of nations. If you belong to a nation at war and you actively support and take satisfaction in the success your army has in killing enemies, then you have the karma of the number of people in that nation who are similarly-minded. If you disagree however, you bear none of that karma.

The question is always whether such borrowings are apt. In this case, borrowing "alpha" for "ka" is not apt because there is no way the term can be used to handle the ablative case (which is missing in English, German, and Greek). The ablative case does exist in Latin, however, thus the ablative for "origo" is "orīgine." Of course, if you go to a Latin-English translation tool, and type in originally pure and original purity, you will not derive orīgene in any way from this. 

The earliest usage of the term original in middle English was in the phrase, "original sin." Of course, original purity is the very opposite of original sin, and far more reflective of the point being made with this term then the clumsy "alpha."

Basically, the equivalent is simply bad English grammar. 

Here is the problem: ka dag is a contraction of the term "ka nas dag pa", which is a noun formation in the ablative case. 

Alpha is just a simple noun modifying 'pure.'

 It might seem trivial to you, but then, scores of polemics in Buddhist discourse are based on just such grammatical niceties. In the case, we are dealing with a term that is in fact an adjectival phrase, where the ablative case in Tibetan is rendered as an adjective. 

There is no way to properly represent the ablative case with "alpha", mentioned above, because alpha cannot take the adjectival/adverbial "ly" ending. In English, you cannot say "pure from alpha", as this makes no sense at all. You cannot say "alphaly" but you can say "originally" and "primordially," and so on.   

"Ka nas" does not mean "from the syllable ka." Ka" is a tibetan noun which means beginning, origin, or first. Its synonyms in Tibetan are rtsa  ba, thog ma, and gdod ma; root, first, or beginning, respectively. Rtsa ba nas, thog ma nas, gdod ma nas, and ka nas are all synonyms in Tibetan, of which the ablative case may easily be rendered in English translation, i.e., from the root, from the first, from the beginning, etc. You can see this work as follows: fundamentally pure (rtsa nas dag pa); thog nas dag (initially pure), gdod nas dag (primordially pure), ka nas dag (originally pure). Or if we are taking the noun to be purity, then, fundamental purity, initial purity, primordial purity, and original purity. Since alpha is not flexible in this respect, it is not really very suitable as term for rendering ka/ka nas. This is the reason I found it to be an odd choice on KB's part, because he is an excellent scholar and a linguist. But it was a bad translation choice when Trungpa first suggested it, and it remains a bad translation choice still.

is not wise,
and will never see the meaning of ‘arisen from conditions’.

The auto commentary states with respect to this:

Therein, the aggregates are the aggregates of matter, sensation, perception, formations and consciousness. Those, called ‘serially joined’, not having ceased, produce another produced from that cause; although not even the subtle particle of an existent has transmigrated from this world to the next. 

The purpose of this is to point out that even though nothing transfers from this life to the next, the assertion that even a subtle particle is annihilated is false. Why? Because in Madhyamaka causes and effects are neither the same nor different.

Every consciousness is characterized by the ability to know and to discern. When it knows and discerns correctly, then this is rig pa. When it knows and discerns incorrectly, this is ma rig pa.

BTW, it is quite well known that Dzogchen does not reject external phenomena. The view of Dzogchen concerning external phenomena is the same as Prasangika Madhyamaka. Phenomena are not mind, but they are also not other than mind, that is to say, they are dependent on mental designations of appearances, but appearances, such as the appearance of a mountain, does not arise from the mind.

Title: Re: Question on Duality/Other

Rig pa is another name for a pure consciousness that recognizes its own state. If a consciousness does not recognize or mis-knows (ma rig pa) its own state, it then continues into delusion. On the other hand, rig pa and ma rig pa are likened to the front and the back of the hand-- they essentially belong together and are both forms of knowing. 

In order to understand this, you need to understand the three-fold ignorance model: ignorance identical with its cause; connate ignorance; and imputing ignorance. These there are discussed in the section on how delusion arises which forms the second of the eleven topics of the Great Perfection. The prayer you are studying uses a two-fold ignorance model -- this presentation is also fine, but I have seen that it can be more easily misunderstood. The tantra this prayer is found in defines things as follows:

In the beginning, since the the unconscious mind overflows from the latent all-basis, the connate ignorance arises. As above, since the deluded vision of sounds, lights and rays arises gradually, the subtle mind that thinks "the external world arises from me," or "I arise from the external world" moves as a mistaken belief.

Here, the all-basis refers to the ālayavijñāna, which is defined as neutral. The "unconscious mind" is the way this tantra defines the first ignorance, the ignorance identical to the cause. Here, this simply means that in the beginning one is unaware of oneself, i.e., unconscious. At the moment the sounds, lights, and rays arise, which are manifestations of one's own state, the connate ignorance arises because now there is a perception which can be mistaken for duality. 

Samantabhadra wakes up without entering delusion because in the second moment of the basis arising from the basis, he recognizes these sounds, lights, and rays as being his own state, and his consciousness becomes prajñā, and prajñā is rig pa, or vidyā. The way the Sound Tantra explains this is:

As such, in saṃsāra at the start and nirvāṇa at the end,
since the buddhas did not become deluded,
the sense organs that rose up out of the basis
recognized the self-appearances as natureless;
there was no lapse into mental analysis of external objects;
and [the self-appearances] were ascertained to be their own
movements.

Remember, ignorance does not equal delusion. This is an important point. 

When we do not recognize these sounds, lights, and rays as being our own state, as stated above, we engage in dualistic grasping, which is the third ignorance, the imputing ignorance. For this reason, the Powerful Aspiration states:

The connate ignorance
is an amnesiac confused consciousness.
The imputing ignorance
grasps at both self and other. 
The two ignorances, connate and imputing, 
are the basis of the delusion of all sentient beings.
Through the aspiration of the Buddha, myself, 
may all the sentient beings of samsara’s three realms
awaken from the thick darkness of amnesia, 
purify the consciousness of dualistic grasping, 
and recognize their own vidyā.

Thus in Buddhahood it is said:

If it is asked how delusion came about, delusion arose from the difference between the basis and the conscious aspect of the basis.

Remember, the basis is just one's unfabricated mind that is clear and empty. Buddhahood again:

As such, because the basis, one’s unfabricated mind, arose as the essence of the sole reality, there is no need to search elsewhere for the place, etc. Thus, that is called self-originated pristine consciousness.

In reality, one should study these things at the feet of a qualified teacher, because with Dzogchen, it is very easy to make mistakes and adopt wrong views. 

As a famous Sakyapa master said, until you gain certainty in the view, the view should not be expressed in words. I understand that you want to understand these things, but talking about them here on Dharmawheel and other places on the internet is likely to just lead you deeper into confusion and an incorrect understanding.

Title: Re: Question on Duality/Other
Content:
There is no such thing as a "single ground awareness." This represents a complete and total misunderstanding of the nature of the basis (ground).

If rigpa were a single ground, then there couldn't be two paths and two results of rig pa and ma rig pa:

All of the universe and beings, samsara and nirvana
have one basis. The two paths and two results
are the enchantments of knowledge (rig pa) and ignorance (ma rig pa)...

The basis being discussed, as clarified here by Jigme Lingpa, is not the original, generic basis (aka the unfabricated mind essence). The basis here is the "contextual" all-basis, which is not dharmakāya at all, it is one's consciousness. It is extremely important to distinguish the all-basis from the dharmakāya.

Remember, we are talking about SECONDARY practices, like the short thun, medium thun, ganapuja, etc.

If people are unhappy with this, or feel they need more support, they can go and follow other teachers. Everyone is free.

CHNN gave this lung frequently. Just look up retreats you gave attended on line, and track down the lung list. I am 100 precent certain you will discover you have received this transmission. Anyway, there is nothing in any Ngondro that is missing from Medium Thun. You really do not need anything beyond the short, medium, and long thun practices. The only reason to do some other Ngondro is if you meet some Lama who insists that you must, and you are actually inspired to practice under their direction. But in the mean time, since this is not the case, you do not need this transmission at all.

If he wants to practice guru yoga, he can practice the guru yoga of the medium thun. It is no different at all from the guru yoga of Dudjom Tersar, Longchen Nyingthig, etc., in meaning. And there is the ngondro practice in the Longsal teachings, mentioned above. I am just reminding him of this.

Nevertheless, a four vow holder holds the vows of refuge, as well as the the precept of not taking life, not stealing, and not lying. This is how it is classified in the three vows. 

But of course, as Mahāyānis, the principle of the precepts is not the physical action, but rather, the intention behind the action -- for this reason, Mahāyāna bhikṣus may handle money, associated with women, and so on, because much of what is prohibited in Śrāvakayāna vows is permitted in Mahāyāna and vice verse. The Trisamvara Chapter of the Ratnakuta goes into this at length, as does Sakya Paṇḍita in his Distinguishing the Three Vows.

Also, having a beer or a glass of wine, or even a whole bottle of wine, does not necessarily imply that one must lose one's mindfulness. It depends on one's capacity.

Can't violate it if you don't hold it. Observing the pratinokṣa vows is a choice, not an obligation.

Please tell me which of the ten nonvirtuous actions of body, voice and mind include the prohibition against alcohol? The point is that precept against intoxication is a prohibition, not a natural nonvirtue. The other four precepts—taking life, taking what is not given, lying, and sexual misconduct—are natural nonvirtues. Not only this, we can understand that the precept against drinking alcohol for monks is classed as the same kind of offense as pulling leaves off of trees. Not that serious. 

Further, in Mahāyāna, drinking alcohol is permitted for the purposes of conviviality with common people, and in unsurpassed secret mantra, it is permitted, period.

You are making a lot of personal assumptions here, which are unwarranted. 1) When did I ever defend Obama's Nobel Peace Prize? 2) When did I ever advocate killing Muslims as a sound and acceptable US Policy? I voted against Obama because of his policies in in 2012 [but not for Romney]. Finally, the Nobel Peace Prize is not mine to bestow or retract. You are just being deliberately antagonistic. 

Ok, having dispensed with your ad hominem remarks, the regime in Myanmar is not basing themselves on any US policy, perceived or otherwise. They are simply engaged in ethnic cleansing of a minority, a minority which enthusiastically backed Aung San Su Khyi's government, a minority they have sought to expunge for decades. The Myanmar Gvt. and its predecessors have been systematically depriving the Rohingya rights as a community since 1962. 

Finally, the idea that as an American, I ought to be quiet because my Gvt. is engaged in actions of which I do not approve is just absurd. You are Canadian, and your Gvt., as well as the British Gvt. was right in there in with American troops, "murdering Muslims" after 9/11 as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_in ... fghanistan. Yes, it is true that Canada sensibly avoided both Bush wars in Iraq, but your country did not avoid the Afghanistan war. 

With respect to Dzongsar Khyentse's letter, as I said before, he is entitled to his own opinions but he is not entitled to his own facts, just as you are not entitled to your own facts. 

These are the facts: 
Fact: The Rohingya have been getting a raw deal for more than half a century, since the military coup that happened in 1962.
Fact: The Rohingya have been a persecuted, stateless people under Myanmar Law since 1962. 
Fact: Aung San Su Khyi's government was won in part because of popular support of the Rohingya population. 
Fact: Aung San Su Khyi has turned a blind eye to the suffering of a significant ethnic group for whom she is responsible as the de facto head of the state. 
Fact: Dzongsar Khyentse's piece contains factual errors, whether or not one agrees with his opinions about the lowliness of Western Civilization or the glory of Asian Civilization. 
Fact: Last time I checked, you were a product of Western Civilization. Must be interesting to be a self-hating westerner. 

Just remember, the greatest Buddhist king in history, Aśoka, after his conversion to Buddhism murdered an entire community of 18,000 Jains for a slight toward the Buddha by one of them, and subsequently offered to pay a bounty of one dinara for the head of any Jain brought to him. By mistake Aśoka's brother, Vitaśoka, a Buddhist monk, was mistaken for a Jain, killed, and his head was turned in for the bounty. Only after this, only after misfortune was brought upon his own family because of his murderous policy, did Aśoka eliminate capital punishment. So much for the glory of Buddhist civilization.

There are some errors of fact in his letter, beginning with, but not confined to, his statement about the origin of the Rohingya people in the Rakhine State in modern day Myanmar. They were not laborers imported by British colonialists during the nineteenth century, since they were among the people encountered and described by the British in what is now the Rakhine state during the 18th century. Francis Buchanan, writing in 1799, states, "The Mahommedans settled at Arakan, call the country Rovingaw; the Persians call it Rekan" and "The first is that spoken by the Mohammedans, who have long settled in Arakan, and who call themselves Rooinga, or natives of Arakan."


I could point out other errors of fact in his letter as well, but there is little point.

The problem with this letter is not his opinions, to which he is certainly entitled, the problem with this piece is his apparent lack of knowledge of facts of the history of the Rohingya and Islamic presence in Burma for nearly a millennia. So, as the saying goes, he is entitled to his own opinions, but he is not entitled to his own facts. The notion that the Rohingya were 19th century British imports is simply false.

It is possible for someone to attain full buddhahood from abhiṣeka, for example, King Indrabhuti I, etc., but it is exceedingly rare.

The point of empowerment is to wake up. If you don't wake up during the empowerment, then you have a sadhana to practice. In that sadhana, you continue to take gather the two accumulations, take empowerment, and so on.

Love and compassion are the basis for Mahāyāna bodhicitta, the wish to attain perfect buddhahood for the benefit of sentient beings. However, love and compassion are not sufficient for eliminating obscurations, so for this one requires wisdom. 

Without compassion, one cannot generate bodhicitta, and without bodhicitta, one cannot attain perfect buddhahood. So one can understand that compassion is the field in which the qualities of awakening grow.

The range of the activity of common bodhisattvas is limited. They have not developed four basis of miraculous power, the five higher knowledges, and so forth. 

Ārya bodhisattvas have more range, since, from the first bhumi onward a bodhisattva has emanations that increase by the power of ten. This, first stage bodhisattvas have 100 emanations and so forth. Also, due to their realization of emptiness, bodhisattvas on the stages are not mired down by the connate fetter of grasping a self, and thus can engage in tremendous deeds. 

Nevertheless, the simple aspiration to attain full awakening has sufficient force to make certain that person will someday attain full awakening. 

With respect to the bodhisattva vow, this is, in actuality, only ever taken once. Each subsequent time one goes to receive the bodhisattva vow in another lifetime, it is signal that one has in fact received in in a previous lifetime. The bodhisattva vow is taken upon the mindstream because it is principally a vow taken as a motivation, unlike pratimokṣa and secret mantra vows, which are principally taken upon the body of this life as precepts for conduct. Thus, at death, one does not lose the bodhisattva vow, unlike pratimokṣa vows and secret mantra vows, which are lost at the breakup of the five aggregates at the time of death.

In order to become a buddha, the Sūtra of Ten Stages, the Lanka, etc., all specify one must receive empowerment. However, that empowerment only comes at the end of the tenth bhumi. In Vajrayāna, that empowerment is found at the beginning of the path. Therefore, common Mahāyāna is a vehicle of the cause, whereas Vajrayāna is a vehicle of the result. As Ācarya Tripitikamāla stated:


Although the goal is the same, since it is unconfused,
with many methods, not difficult,
and mastered by those of sharp faculties,
Mantrayāna is superior.

With respect to 24/7/365 practice of yoga, in Mahāyāna there are no actual methods for integrating all of one's activities into the path. Washing is not a practice. Eating food is not a practice. Taking desire into the path is not a practice. Taking sleep into the path is not a practice. Taking waking into the path is not a practice, and so on. There is no practice connected with developing divine pride. There are no practices connected with utilizing sense objects for one's own benefit, There are no practices which use the body as a basis. There are no practices for taking birth, life, and death onto the path. Mahāyāna lacks the manifold methods found in Vajrayāna. 

With respect to using sense objects in the path, in common Mahāyāna one is not permitted to use sense objects in the path unless one is trying to benefit others. So examples of bodhisattvas sporting with 60,000 maidens and so forth are in the context of benefitting others. By contrast, in Vajrayāna, one is permitted from the beginning to use sense objects in the path for ones own purposes. This is a fundamental difference. With respect to kleshas, different kinds of practices are suited for people with different mixes of affliction. In general, the dominant affliction of this age however is hatred, and so the majority of practices are related the Vajra family. 

The basis for it being appropriate for beginners to enter Vajrayāna is personal karma. People who are fortunate in this degenerate era will easily enter Vajrayāna teachings and make rapid progress, attaining full buddhahood either in this life or the bardo, or at worst, with three, seven, or sixteen lifetimes. In common Mahāyāna there are no practitioners who attain full buddhahood in less than three asaṃkhyakalpas, despite specious claims to the contrary in various schools, principally Sino-Japanese Mahāyāna, which directly contradict the Buddha's teachings on the subject in sȗtra. 

With respect to burning one's fingers, as the Hevajra Tantra states "That which binds fools frees the wise."

In one place you claim a given particular dharma is the dharmadhātu (x=y); in the next place you claim that any given dharma exists because all dharmas exist (because x—&gt; y), which you define collectively as the "dharmadhātu, which definition is incorrect; and finally, you assent to the point that "dharmadhātu" describes the nature of all dharmas (as emptiness, suchness, the limit of reality, and so on). This is incoherent. 

Moreover, your reasoning that dependent origination covers your identity proposition is also incorrect. Dependent origination only covers conditioned phenomena. Any given dependently produced dharma is compounded. The dharmadhātu is uncompounded. It is completely incoherent to claim that any compounded entity is identical with an uncompounded entity. There is no analysis that one can conduct to demonstrate this point. It would be like saying that upon analysis, earth is space.

All of these things, buddhas, bodhisattvas, hells, the triple realm, etc., are relative truths. None of them withstand ultimate analysis.

It is well understood in Mahāyāna in general that there are no phenomena not included in the dharmadhātu. 

The question here is not the general Mahāyāna understanding. Of course, if one is making this kind of argument that you proposed, if everything is the dharmadhātu, all cognitive processes and their parts are included within the dharmadhātu. This is trivial. The point you alluded to is covered explicitly on pp. 762-767 in vol. 2 of CSQI. 

As Aryadeva points out, by realizing the emptiness of one thing (dharmatā), one realizes the emptiness of all things (dharmdhātu). So I don't think this point is unique to Chih-I. But it is not controversial point, it's middle-period, standard Mahāyāna—&nbsp;empty sense consciousnesses arise from the meeting of empty sense organs with empty sense objects. Everything arises from emptiness, and everything disappears into emptiness. And even emptiness itself is not established as anything real. It is all illusory all the way down. 

BTW Swanson rightly abandons "realm of reality" as a gloss for dharmadhātu in CSQI.

In usage given in the citation, the term seems to be more consistent with the eighteen dhatus of Abhidharma, taken as a trio: the six dhātus of sense organs; the six dhātus of sense consciousnesses; and the six dhātus of sense objects. In other words, the sense organ element; the sense object element; and sense consciousness element for a given sense perception. The usage you note from Swanson has nothing at all do with the dharmadhātu as defined in Mahāyāna as a generic term for emptiness. It has to do with describing the process of cognition. You do not find the term dharmadhātu used in Mahāyāna texts in this way unless it is explicitly denoted as part of the eighteen dhātus. Calling any three of these dhātus "the absolute" is just wrong. It shows that BZ has no understanding of basic Buddhism. The usage of "dharma" here seems generic, in the sense that the eighteen dhatus are all dharmas, and the use of the term dharmadhātu here is generic because the sense organ, object, and consciousness are not being determined.

The main thing you fail to explain, in fact, is how all these highly skilled Indian Panditas were unable to detect that the text before them was spurious, great paṇḍitas such as Śṛī Siṃhaprabha, his disciple, Vimalamitra, and so on. If one is to take your contention seriously, one has to assume that between whatever date you assign in the mid-7th century for the composition of this text in China, it needed to make its way back to India, where it was enthusiastically received as authentic by the Vajrayāna community in India no later than the mid 8th century, and from there transmitted to Tibet. One must assume their Sanskrit and expertise in their own literature was superior to yours.

The "five characteristics" refers to the the way one analyzes the three natures. So, the five characteristics are name, sign, concept, correct knowledge, and suchness. Name in turn refers to the imputed nature; sign and concept refer to the dependent nature; and correct knowledge and suchness refer to the perfected nature.

The MMK 24:17-19 could not be more clear:

Whatever arises in dependence, 
that is explained as emptiness;
that [emptiness] is dependently designated, 
that is the middle way. 

Why? There exist no phenomena
that are not dependently originated,
Therefore, there are no phenomena
that are not empty. 

If all of this is not empty,
there could not no arising and perishing, 
and consequently, for you 
the four noble truths would not exist. 


This whole discussion of what is the middle way comes directly after the discussion of how the Buddha only teaches two truths. The two truths are themselves the middle way, the latter is not a third truth. The whole purpose of this discussion in MMK 24 is to explain how the four noble truths are possible only if dependently originated phenomena are understood to be emptiness. 

There is no fault in studying Chih-I, but there is a fault if one reads Chih-I into Nāgārjuna. It's best to leave Chih-I out of Madhyamaka altogether. Chih-I  generated his own school, and is how he should be understood.

The MMK 24:8-9 is pretty clear:

The doctrine taught by the Buddha
is correctly predicated upon two truths:
the relative truth of the world, 
and the truth of the sublime meaning.

Thos who do not know the difference
between those two truths,
do not know the the profound reality
of the doctrine of the Buddha.


Samsara and nirvana are both relative truths, and that is why there is not even a subtle distinction that can be made between them. 

The doctrine of the two truths is supported on the basis of the Meeting of the Father and Son Sūtra, the locus classicus for restricting the number of truths the Buddha taught in Mahāyāna to the two truths. The Buddha himself never taught a third truth. There was never any need. Why? Because as the sūtra mentioned above states, the doctrine of the two truths arose out of the Buddha's direct perception and personal experience.

Clyde, I have only agreed to explain to you what the traditional teachings say on the subject, not to engage with you in a debate. 

Ancient Buddhist conceived of all matter being as being composed of four states or qualities: earth (solidity), water (liquidity), fire (heat), and air (motility). A rock for example, will be understood to be predominately composed of the earth element, etc.

If you ask me what a gandharva's body is made up of beyond the subtle matter of the air element, I cannot give you that answer, because no such answer is supplied in the ancient literature. If this does not satisfy your wish to understand what ancient Buddhists understood about gandharvas, I am afraid our conversation is now at an end.

I will answer the last question first. Death, from a traditional Buddhist point of view, is reckoned from the moment the mind and body of this life separate. That takes place generally within 72 hours of the last breath. 

Your problem with the first question is that you are taking the word "air" too literally. You can understand here that "air refers to physical matter that is in a very motile state, what you earlier described as gaseous, but that really does not grasp the concept here. 

As for your second question, when your mind separates from the body in this life, it immediately appropriates a subtle body, and this being, which you have now become, is called a gandharva. The Gandharva, according to the ancient Buddhist conception of it, can pass through more coarse matter, is clairvoyant, etc., so not entirely confined by what we call "physical laws."

This has been explained, but I will explain it again. [Begin by placing your mind in the cosmological world view of the four elements] The body of a bardo being is made up principally of the element air, so bardo beings have a body, but it's physical body is principally the air element. The other four aggregates are mental, being mind and its mental factors. 

The gandharva arises after the dis-integration or breaking up, of the five aggregates of this life at death. One's mind immediately appropriates this "subtle" body, which in the first three weeks after death, resembles the body of the deceased in features and proportion. However, being subtle, it is not visible to ordinary people. It has all senses organs because it has a subtle body. The kind of birth they have— out of the four types of birth, apparitional, warmth and moisture birth, egg birth, and womb birth—&nbsp;is apparitional birth, like devas, pretas, and hell beings. Gandharvas persist in the bardo for a maximum of 49 days. This time period is deceptive, because time does not function in the bardo the same way we perceive it. These forty nine "days" can elapse in moments, in any case, the classical time period is 49 human days. 

When a gandharva enters the womb at conception it loses consciousness, and is not longer a bardo being, so it "passes away."

When you reside in New York, you are known as a New Yorker. But if you get on a train to  to move to LA, now you are known as a "passenger," and will remain so until you reach your destination. 

You can think of the bardo as Penn Station. You can think of the six realms as six cities to which you might move, such as Washington DC and so on. 

All beings who pass away spend 49 days in the intermediate state before they take rebirth as a being in one of the six realms. Any being in the bardo is known as a gandharva, just as any one on a train in known as a passenger (apart from engineer, conductors, and transit cops).

The point is that the fact that there was an earlier witness to a Sanskrit original, that is, an earlier translation, puts into question Nattier's idea that the Heart Sūtra was a Chinese psuedographia. 

Whatever syntax issues there are with the grammar can be understood differently. For example, it could have been written down in Central Asia in an ungrammatical Sanskrit, by someone who had formal knowledge of Sanskrit, but who was not a native Indian, there are many possibilities which have not been examined. 

But on the other hand, we know that Indians accepted the text as canonical by 800 with the arrival of Vimalamitra to Tibet. So, they apparently were comfortable with whatever grammatical novelties the text presented and made no mention of them in any commentary of which I aware.

"Gandharva" is simply name for a being born in the antarabhāva, the intermediate state, or bardo, just like "human being" is a name for someone born in the human realm, "animal" is the name for a being born in the animal realm, "preta" is the name for a being born in the preta realm and so on. The term was derived from gandharvas, which are somewhat equivalent to fairies, and often depicted with horses heads in Indian mythology, they are associated with music. In this case however, the term was chose because beings in the antarabhava persist on smells—&nbsp;gandharva literally means, "odor eater."

There is nothing with which to merge. 

According to the teachings of Man ngag sde (but not sems sde or klong sde), at the time of death, the elements dissolve: earth into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into space, space into consciousness, consciousness into luminosity, and finally, luminosity dissolves into pristine consciousness. This happens to all beings at the time of death. The question is: will one recognize the sounds, lights and rays of one's own pristine consciousness in the bardo of dharmatā or not? If one does, liberation.

A couple of observations:

The term "true self" is nowhere used in any Indian or Tibetan Buddhist text, not even in gzhan stong texts. 

Even in the Uttaratantra, where we find the Tibetan term, dam pa'i bdag in the discussion of ātmapāramitā, the Sanskrit text simply gives the term as ātma. The "dam pa" was added by Ngog Lotsawa to distinguish this "self," free from the proliferation of the self [i.e. existence] imputed by the hindus and nonself [i.e. nonexistence] imputed by śrāvakas, as  a quality of the dharmakāya, —&nbsp;in other words, it is another way of saying the dharmakāya is free from extremes.  This usage in the Uttaratantra comes from contrasting the impurity, nonidentity, suffering, and impermanence of compounded phenomena, with the purity, identity, bliss, and permanence of dharmakāya. But if someone should think this contextual usage of "self" with respect to dharmakāya means dharmakāya is an existent self, they have not understood anything of Mahāyāna at all, let alone Dzogchen, or even Buddhadharma for that matter. 

With respect to the term bdag nyid chen po, it is a somewhat rare Dzogchen technical term, also found in the Guhyagarbha literature. Even so, its usage is very restricted. In his commentary on the Kun byed rgyal po, Khenpo Zhenphen Ozer glosses it as rang byung ye shes.

But here we are talking about memory. Memories are active concepts of the seven consciousnesses. This is basic to all Buddhist thinking on the issue. The question concerned whether Buddhism acknowledged what we term unconscious mental processes. It doesn't. The distinction made in Buddhism is a distinction between nonconceptual and conceptual cognitive processes: for example direct perceptions on the one hand, and the identification of direct perceptions as objects on the other. We are not necessarily aware, in a conscious sense, of all that we directly perceive because direct perceptions are by nature nonconceptual, and to be conscious of a given thing requires us to have a concept about it. In other words, the first moment of cognition is nonconceptual; in the second moment, mental factors such as perception jump in and allow us to discriminate the blue object we are having a direct perception of as a blue cup. When we have direct perceptions of unfamiliar entities, we struggle to discriminate them, and often, we do not bother to discriminate them at all. But we cannot become conscious of a given thing of which we have not had a direct perception-- this does not bar us from having an imagination, but in reality our abstract imagination is predicated on bits and pieces of newly arranged direct perceptions. The Buddhist theory of cognition, as has been noted, is in general a) nominalist and b) resembles, somewhat, Hume's pov in the Inquiry into Human Understanding. The outlier is Yogacāra, which bears some similarities to Berkely's thought. 

In general, what Buddhism considers latent are afflictions (kleṣa), termed in their latent form, anuśaya. There are 6 basic anuśaya: attachment, anger, pride, ignorance, false views, and doubt. These anuśayas are not subconscious tendencies. These six then gets further divided into a total of 98. If you want to know more about them, their number and so on, consult chapter 5 of the Koshabhasyam. 

Karma can never be latent, why? Because karma is caused by afflictions. According to Madhyamaka, a karma continues without ceasing until it meets its condition for ripening; according to Yogacāra, a karma makes an impression, then ceases; and when that impression meets it special condition for ripening, it does. 

If you want to understand in more detail how this all works in Yogacāra, one should consult the Mahāyāna Samgraha.

Memories are mental concepts possessed by any of seven dhātus of consciousness of external or internal objects with which we are familiar. This is the basic definition. 

My point was simply that there were, in the view of Buddhadharma, no such thing as unconscious memories, i.e. data that is storied somewhere in some medium to be called forth later. Memory, in Buddharma, is simply the ability to recall objects that the mind has experienced. The power of that memory is commensurate with one's level of concentration. To repeat, no medium was ever proposed in which memories are stored. Essentially, from the point of view of Buddhadharma, we do not have unrecalled memories. If we do not remember something, it is not a memory. A memory can only be called a memory if there is a recollection of some past experience we have recalled in the present through a conceptual operation related to the seven dhātus of consciousness. An unrecalled memory is a nonmemory in Buddhadharma.  

But in modern parlance, we have become accustomed to referring to things we have not recalled as "memories" because we recall things we have forgotten, and so we infer, we must have unconscious memories because we are very conditioned by pop Freudianism, and imagine there is such a thing as an unconscious mind, also rejected in Buddhadharma, which stores memories and so on.

This may be because the semantic field of the Buddhadharma ideas of memory/recollection predate and never later accommodated a model of data storage based on writing things down on paper. 

The model used, if one can call it a model, is clarity vs. cloudiness, distracted vs. undistracted. That is If your mind is clear/concentrated, you can remember more, if your mind is cloudy/distracted, you remember less. But in this model, no storage medium was ever proposed or even intimated.

Buddhism explains memory perfectly well. It does just not explain memory with the present-day metaphor of data stored in a storage medium for later recall. Instead it describes memory as a function of mental nondistraction.

The ālayavijñāna is not actually a separate consciousness. It is a name for consciousness in its role as a repository of traces, vasanas (a theory of the Yogacārins the Madhyamaka find very faulty).

In the Yogacāra system, the ālayavijñāna does not perform any cognitive function at all, not even as an unconscious. In the Yogacāra presentation, it is basically inert, which is why Madhyamakas tend to reject their presentation.

Nope. Tathāgatagarbha, is not a consciousness, unless you take Lanka-avatara point of view and consider it to be the ālaya-vijñāna, And even here, the ālaya-vijñana does not engage in any mental operations at all. It is merely a name for consciousness in its role of a repository of traces. 

There is no "subconscious" in Buddhadharma. Derived karma are actions which result from conscious volitions—&nbsp;and there are no such a thing as unconscious volitions, at least, not in Buddhadharma.

Content:
In general, the lung for the sadhana is included in a given empowerment/blessing/permission rite, since the visualization read by the lama for the students is taken directly from the sadhana, as are the refuge, etc. prayers one recites in the empowerment, etc.

However, for any given deity cycle there can be several different sadhanas of different lengths with different details, so one needs generally to get the lung for these separately. But in some case, giving the lung for the longest sadhana is considered to be sufficient for the shorter sadhanas as well. It depends somewhat on the master and the tradition. 

In general, however, for permission rites, there is only one sadhana, and in this case, usually the permission rite is sufficient, all one needs following that is the explanation.

No, we do know why-- he is a great historian, he must have came to the conclusion that the version of the yum story is rather late (it is), and he found a earlier source where A ti Mu Wer manifested as the tiger and found that account more credible than the later tradition.

The texts that refer to the tiger/tigress as a yum all seem to post-date Taksham's revelations. I can find no evidence of this in any bio of Padmasambhava, Yeshe Tosgyal, or any terma cycle that dates earlier than Taksham's bio of Tsogyal. 

The collection of eight manifestations sadhana in the Northern Treasures states:

stag mo drud ma'i gdan la bzhugs. The verb "'drud pa" means to carry, so probably pregnant, as in "carrying" cubs. No mention of being a yum. 

The earliest independent sadhana I know of is in the Drigung Yangzab, which again has no mention of a tigress as a yum. Yangzab was revealed in the first half of the 16th century.

It basically boils down to the difference between the Buddhist, and largely western academic view, that the Bon of the time of the imperial period, 800 and before was a completely different religion from the Bon that emerged during the 10th and eleventh century under the influence of Buddhism. This is also Chogyal Namkhai Norbu's point view. From this perspective then, the Ati Mu wer that we see pictured in the Gekhod cycle is a later innovation, only nominally related to the A ti mu wer who was an important protective deity of Zhang Zhung. 

That fact that Buddhists do not accept Bonpo accounts of history in general is always going to be a sore spot between Buddhism and Bon. As far as the majority of Buddhists are concerned, modern Bon is basically an imitation of Buddhism. However, in many Bonpo ritual texts, and even some kinds of ritual texts preserved by Buddhists, such as lha bsang offerings and so on, we can see evidence of the real pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet. Most of the Buddhist worldly protectors are originally pre-Buddhist local deities, btsan, rgyalpos, and so on.

Bonpos, naturally, will be unhappy with these opinions.

Yes,in his Drollo ter cycle, the medium length sadhana refers to the tigress as the sbyor yum, "the consort for union," who is a passionate (ngar ma) bengal tigress (rgya stag). In another place, a long praise, the tigress is referred to as the "sgrol yum," the consort for liberation" who is a brilliant red, wrathful tigress. In the Kha thang literature, the union consort is generally understood to be Tsogyal, the liberation consort is generally understood to be Tashi Kyidren. In yet another place, the mount is a red and black terrifying bengal tigress with iron claws. 

Overall however, the liberation consort is generally identified as Ekajati, and as in the Bio of Tsogyal, Tsogyal is identified as Ekajati, while the tigress is Kyidron. However, as I specified before, this identification arrives in a terma of the later period, and it seems that it spread widely, since Taksham's bio of Tsogyal paints a far more comprehensive lifestory of Tsogyal than other, earlier bios which make no mention of this episode at Paro Taksang.

I think the most likely explanation is that the legend of Khyidron being the consort is quite late (I can find no reference to it earlier than the Taksham bio of Tsogyal -- it is not mentioned in any earlier bio of Tsogyal-- I looked), and that ChNN was referring to earlier historical sources he had available to him that are now obscure, since as you mention, it seems no one asked him for a source, including myself.

 -- Lady of the Lotus Born, pg. 96

This is without doubt the source of the identifications with one of Guru Rinpoche's consorts. It's fairly late, however. Taksham Nuden Dorje was active in the latter half of the 17th century. I am failing to find any reference to this idea earlier than this one.

Palden Gyatso (17th century) writes in his History of Kilaya:

At the cave of the Glorious Tiger's Lair in Paro, he engaged in the practice of Vajrakīlaya and Vajra Wrath (rdo rje khro bo) rode the tiger and liberated all māras and samaya breakers with the magic power of piercing and conquering the assembly of obstructors with his vajrakīla.

This event occurred when Guru Rinpoche was practicing Vajrakīlaya at Paro Taktsang. Thus, this is what it means to say "Drollo is the essence of Vajrakīlaya." Drollo is the personification of the khrodavajra, the vajra of wrath, "Rdo rje gro bo lod." This manifestation arises directly out of Guru Rinpoche's realization of Vajrakīlaya.

According to the DT Drollo chronicle, while at Paro Taktsang, Guru Rinpoche manifested the vajrakhrodasamadhi, the samadhi of vajra wrath, out of which he arose in the form of Dorje Drollo. If you examine any Kilaya sadhana, you will discover a line that says, "Vajra wrath severs hatred" or something of this nature. The source of this idea of mine is the late Yeshe Phunstog, an American who was a very close disciple of Dudjom Rinpoche, and Gyatrul Rinpoche's right hand man for many years. His main practice was Dudjom Drollo. He informed me of this on the occasion Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje's bestowal of the Dudjom Drollo in Boston, Ma., 1992, when asked, Ngakpa Rinpoche confirmed this. "Gro bo lod" is a corruption of krodhalokottāra, which is why the main sadhana of Dorje Drollo in the DT begins with "Namo mahāguru vajra krodhalokottāraye."

Now, then, I know what Shenphen Rinpoche told me, and I know what Ngakpa RInpoche said, and I know what Yeshe Phuntsog said. I don't know, nor do I much care, what other Lamas say. You are free, of course, to follow anyone's opinion you find more credible than mine.
