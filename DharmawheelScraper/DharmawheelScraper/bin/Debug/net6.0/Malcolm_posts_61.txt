Right, that was where the problem began at e-sangha. We would ask, people would get offended, etc. Then, in trying to establish international standards of ordination we ran into issues, such as Zen priests demanded to be treated and considered exactly the same as fully ordained bhikshus and so on. Our basic policy became that if you are not a shramana or bhiksu, you are not a member of the monastic sangha. You could be considered "ordained", but not as a monk. We drew a strong distinction, and a valid one at that, between lay "ordinations" and monastic ordinations. 

This was what lead to the Zen debacle at e-sangha. It caused many other problems as well.

I think evolution is more appropriate. There is a core DNA, if you will, dependent origination, that makes all these speciations of Dharma related to one another. But some forms of dharma continue to evolve, others are on the verge of extinction, or are functionally extinct (i.e. Huayen, etc.), and so on., and some are simply better adapted to survive in the modern world than others.

Title: Re: Other Buddhas
Content:
It is highly unlikely. 

No Pali suttas of which I am aware are so highly self-referential, making constant references to worshipping themselves in book form, or constant references to the doctrine they contain, or defensive remarks about criticizing their contents. In other words, the Agamas and Nikayas seem to lack any anxiety at all; whereas Mahāyāna sūtras seem to be filled with anxious polemics about their authenticity. 

This anxiety that is so noticeable in early Mahāyāna texts begins to vanish when India authors, copying a strategy of the Theravada Abhidhamma pitika authors, hit on the strategy of ultimately siting the original source of Mahāyāna sūtras in the person of Tathāgata Vairocana in Akaniṣṭha Gandavyuha. 

Now freed form the spatio-temporal constraints of Kapilavastu, Rajagriha, etc., and utilizing docetic strategies of transmission (the three kāyas), these texts were now immune to hermeneutical critiques of authenticity based on their composition as texts ultimately voiced by Shakyamuni located within the lifetime and career of Shakyamuni. Shakyamuni's role, in India, as the proponent of Mahāyāna was subordinated to that of Vairocana. Shakyamuni-as-nirmanakāya now appears more as a shepherd of the Dharma, rather than its ultimate source. There are many other threads one can work out from this basic premise. 

This did not happen without some dissenting backlash, of course i.e. the Saddharmapundarika can be seen as a reaction to this firm trend, with the ultimate result that in India the Saddharmapundarika was completely sidelined since it did not fit into the innovative Yogacara docetic model of sūtra transmission with the sambhogakāya acting as an intermediary between the dharmakāya and the nirmanakāya. 

Yogacara doceticism is a vital key also in the composition and dissemination of Vajrayana. Now, freed utterly from the dictates of the career of Gautama, Buddhist authors/mystics could fearlessly compose tantras free of concern about their historicity. The only evidence of anxiety in the tantras is that they would fall into improper hands. 

The Agamas, Vaipulya-sūtras, and tantras should be seen as a successive record of the religious experiences of people who attained awakening in some measure, starting with The Buddha. When the main themes of Indian compositional strategies in Mahāyāna had been set down, these themes adopted to compose original sūtras in Chinese, Tibetan, Khotanese, etc. These themes of composition were so strong, so compelling, that even nominally non-buddhist peoples such as Bonpos adopted them hook, line and sinker, developing a religion in Tibet that is virtually indistinguishable from Tibetan Buddhism other than details of narrative origin, and used these narrative strategies to express their own spiritual evolution.

I am a firm believer in evolution. I personally think that Buddhism is a religion that underwent and is undergoing significant evolution, reaching its high point in the teachings of the great perfection, and adapting itself to various cultures in an evolutionary manner according to the environment in which it found itself. 

The reason Buddhism was able to undergo this evolution without it's core being destroyed, but rather revealed and expressed with greater and greater clarity as successive generations of buddhas refined its essential message, is that the essence of the dharma is dependent origination. 

Ok, said enough, now have to get back to work.

We can speculate all we like. 

But there are some salient points to bear in mind. It was not imagined by Mahāyānists that there were persistent oral lineages of Mahāyāna teachings in Jambudvipa. 

Quite the contrary. Mahāyāna is the original treasure tradition. Mahāyānists came to believe that their texts had been laid away for four centuries or more and then revealed by such masters as Nāgārjuna and so on, kept by Bodhisattvas such as Mañjuśrī for safe keeping until the time was right for them again to be promulgated. Therefore, any honest person whose mind is not clouded by the delusion of religious zeal and fervor has to admit that it is unlikely that the detailed and highly complex literary compositions which we now know as Mahāyāna sūtras could not possibly have been composed in any thing other than a visionary manner at a much later time than their purported setting. Moreover, they would have to admit that these detailed literary compositions, (even as early as the Digha Nikāya), betray evidence of extensive editing and development over many centuries, as is proven by the layers of such texts in Chinese translation. For example, the Maitreya Chapter, so important to gzhan stong exegesis, is completely missing in Chinese sources, proving that it was a Yogacara addition to the PP corpus.

The main point is to fill the room with fragrance, if you are offering incense devotionally. Therefore, I recommend you use an aromatherapy nebulizer. 

You can then procure pure sandalwood essential oil, or agarwood, etc., add a couple drops to your nebulizer, and enjoy the benefits of the aroma and none of the downsides. You could even experiment with creating blends of essential oils for your needs. 

A nebulizer works by creating water vapor via ultrasound. 

Keep in mind that burning wood for fires, etc, also produce the same compounds. As well as cars, city traffic, etc. 

As long as your house is well ventilated, you use vetted pure incenses from a reliable sources that uses no accelerants, etc., then I think then there is no additional risk to your children that is not already present from our toxic industrial environment as a whole.

Well how about the obvious answer? The Mahāyāna sutras were written after the Agamas. That answers all questions concerning why this is nor present in that, etc 

I understand that there are some people who wish to dearly maintain a death grip on the idea that Mahāyāna sutras are literally, historically, the words of one Gautama Buddha physically uttered sometime between his awakening at 35 and his passing at age 80 -- but that is just religion, that is not Dharma. Dharma lies in the truth of the words, not the mise en scène.

Title: Re: Dzogchen Without Buddhism?

Hi Magnus:

The system of the nine yānas is actually an Anuyoga perspective, where Dzogchen is conceived of as the result of Anuyoga practice. 

However, since the dgongs pa zang thal cycle, the Vima snying thig cycles, etc., frequently define the most secret unsurpassed great perfection cycle as not part of the nine yānas I am pretty comfortable in asserting there is a dzogchen that lies outside the nine yānas. This is the source of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu's assertion that there are two approaches to Dzogchen, one gradual, based on the nine yānas; and one which does not depend on the nine yānas at all, Dzogchen as a completely self-contained system of realization that does not depend at all on the vehicles of cause and result. 

The Lamp The Severs Proliferation from the Copper Lettered Collection in the Vima snying thig has the following passage which will put things in context:

"The conceited vehicles of the nine yānas
do not depart even a an iota from eternalism and annihilationism."

The two can be taught separately, interwoven, or side by side. 

Saying that the utterly secret unsurpassed cycle of Dzogchen is outside the nine yānas is the teaching of Nirmanakāya Garab Dorje. Therefore, since it is the teaching of Nirmanakāya Garab Dorje, it is not outside the pale of Buddhism. 

Common Atiyoga is the basically sems sde, in this scheme of things.

According to Kongtrul the Great the mind transmission of Dzogchen can happen directly from Samantabhadra to high-level bodhisattvas without Garab Dorje or other Teacher. [/quote]

From the point of view of Dzogchen, attaining buddhahood is the state of Dzogchen. But from the point of view of Dzogchen, the vehicles of cause and effect cannot result in buddhahood. They are of provisional meaning or of indirect meaning. 


[/quote]
Nevertheless it was transmited to Garab Dorje and other  "twelve Dzogchen teachers" and Padmasambhava only as I remeber. According to terma of Pema Lingpa Padmasambhava had Samantabhadra and Vajrasattva, not only Garab Dorje, as His Teachers of Dzogchen.[/quote]

There are a few lineages of Dzogchen man ngag sde -- Garab Dorje, Manjushrimitra, Shri Singha, Jnanasutra, Vimalamitra; 

Garab Dorje, Shri Singha, Vimalamitra in tandem with  Padmasamabhava;

Garab Dorje, Manjushrimitra, Shri Singha, Vimalamitra;

Then Garab Dorje, Shri Singha, Padmasamabhava;

Then Garab Dorje, Padmasamabhava;

Garab Dorje, Shri Singha, Vairocana;

There is also a lineage of Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, Padmasambhava -- for example, the Khon Vajrakilaya gives this lineage. This just means that Padmsambhava was a full vidyādhara, a buddha possessing all three kāyas completely. So yes, there are terma systems where the lineage of Dzogchen teachings is as you describe, even so, believe it or not, Padmasambhava declares to Yeshe Tsogyal that Vimalamitra, and not he, is the main regent of Dzogchen teachings in Tibet. The resason Padmasambhaba teaches her Dzogchen is that she did not have the karmic connection with Vimalamitra to learn Dzogchen from him, or so it is stated in the dgongs pa zang thal. 

And lots of other lineages too numerous to mention both long and short, kama and terma. 

In any case, Dzogchen is not subject to the criteria of sutra. Things such as Supreme Nirmanakāyas and all this stuff is just a conceptual limitation created by trying fit Dzogchen within the narrow hermeneutics of Mahāyāna sūtra dogmatism. That is like trying to fit Mahāyāna sutra criteria into Hīnayāna sūtra dogmatism. 

Just as Mahāyāna shares some features with Hīnayāna, Dogchen shares some features with Mahāyāna, but just as Mahāyāna cannot fit inside of the narrow criteria imposed by the Hīnayāna conception of the personage of buddhas; likewise, Dzogchen cannot fit inside the broader, yet still limiting conception of the personage of buddhas imposed by common mahāyāna. In other words, if you try to impose a common Mahāyāna hermeneutical framework on Dzogchen, it does not work. It is best to abandon that framework since it is not important in Dzogchen and does not work at all. So while Shakyamuni is considered one of the twelve historical teachers of Dzogchen prior to Garab Dorje for reason we have already discussed (he predicted the arrival of the effortless vehicle in the future), our teachings of Dzogchen do not come from Shakyamuni and there is no evidence that he ever taught it on Jambudvipa. 

Nirmanakāyas do not have the certainty of place, time, teacher, teaching and retinue. Just accept that and move on.

Dzogchen does not require the ten tattvas described by the Anutarrayoga tantras, at least not according to Kun byed rgyal po rgyud. 

Dzogchen does not require the methods of the vehicles of cause and the vehicles of result. 

Even so, these two fact mention above do not place any teaching of Dzogchen "outside" Buddhism even though utterly secret unsurpassed Dzogchen is outside the nine yānas. 

As it is said, sems sde is for intellectuals; klong sde is for those who like to meditate; man ngag sde is for those who practice according to intimate instructions. 

Then among man ngag sde cycles there is outer, inner, secret and utterly secret, etc. 

Still, even the most advanced Dzogchen practitioners go refuge, cultivate bodhicitta and dedicate merits i.e. use the three sublime principles of the path.

Kagyu Mahāmudra in many respects is very similar to Chan, and even uses Chan sūtras like the Vajrasamadhi sutra to supports its dkar po gcig thub presentation.

He does not criticize Dzogchen, actually since he regards it as part of the Nyingma completion stage. 

Not all Dharma systems in Tibet assert that one must follow the five paths and ten stages approach. For example, Dzogchen. Dzogchen is definitely a cig char ba presentation.

There are two kinds of dharma: dharma of text and dharma of realization. 

There are two kinds of buddhism: buddhism of text and buddhism of realization. 

There are two kinds of dzogchen: dzogchen of texts and dzogchen of realization. 

In order to establish that "dzogchen" is "without buddhism"; one would have to identify something in Buddhism that Dzogchen is missing; or conversely, something in Dzogchen that Buddhism is missing. 

In reality, Dzogchen is just another way of explaining śūnyatāprābhāsvarāsaṁbhedaḥ in relation to the trikāya. No matter how profound Dzogchen may be (and it is the most profound teaching of Buddhism), it does not go beyond explaining how to realize the trikāya state through knowledge (vidyā,) of one's own basis (sthāna):
emptiness (śūnyatā, stong pa nyid; svarūpa, ngo bo; visuddha, ka dag; dharmakāya) 
luminosity ('od gsal, prābhāsvarā; prakriti,rang bzhin) nirabhogana, lhun grub; sambhogakāya) 
inseparability (āsaṁbhedaḥ, dbyer med; karuna, thugs rje; nirmanakāya)

Since śūnyatāprābhāsvarāsaṁbhedaḥ is nothing more than what the Buddha taught, even Dzogchen cannot go beyond being a teaching of a Buddha.

I understand your point of view, though I do not agree with it. I don't agree with your conspiracy theory either. 

You seem think that Vajrayāna is all about dhyāna, samapatti and samadhi. It isn't. 

Vajrayāna practice is a method of reversing dependent origination. Of course, in that process we need to use samadhi and samapatti. But not in the way it is used in sutrayāna methodology. 

There is a school in Tibetan Buddhism called the Kagyu school. They teach a system called mahāmudra. They assert that mahāmudra is also found in the Mahāyāna sūtras (but not, of course in Hīnayāna sūtras. And they teach, in their mahāmudra, a system called sūtra mahāmudra which is the basis of the famed four yogas of mahāmudra of Gampopa.  They emphasize the practice of dhyana in their system of mahāmudra

They also clearly recognize a mahāmudra that comes from Vajrayāna practice. They further recognize a type of mahāmudra that comes from sudden insight based on a kind of introduction by a master, called essence mahāmudra. 

They clearly differentiate sūtra mahāmudra and "tantric" mahāmudra by the methods that are used. The methods used in tantric mahāmudra are things like creation stage (visualizing oneself as a deity), mantra recitation, working with prāṇayāma (not mindfulness of breathing), "erotic" yogas, yogas connected with sleep, waking, etc. 

The methods used in sutra mahāmudra are solely śamatha and vipaśyāna combined with the four yogas -- which are really stages in the deepening of śamatha and vipaśyāna.

Essence mahāmudra has no methods. 

Vajrayāna is different than sūtra teachings because the methods of deity yoga, prāṇayāma, etc., are never taught in sūtra. No cakras, no ṇāḍīs, etc. None of that newage hippy Vajrayāna stuff is found in the sūtras, nor explained by sūtra masters -- not in India, not in China, not in Japan.  

We Vajrayānists assert that all of our hippy methods, deity yoga, and so on, cause our path to be faster than the pure Mahāyāna sūtra route. These criteria did not evolve in Tibet, they evolved in India. Of course, there is some internal debate as I mentioned above. The Kagyu school in many respects is close to Chan school and even uses some Chan scriptures as a basis for their arguments. 

You can accept or reject Vajrayāna claims -- but at least you should clearly understand what they are -- a clarity that thus far has been absent in your presentation.

The Buddhist view is essentially that all situations of samsara and nirvana come from inside and are resolved by looking inside. You cannot say that there is one kind of Buddhism which is "insider", and another kind of Buddhism that is "outsider". The essence of the Buddhist view is in "insiderness". There isn't other kind of Buddhism.

In Vajrayana, abhisheka is a method of attaining full awakening from Yoga Tantra on up. If you do not attain full awakening, then you have methods of sadhana, creation stage, completion stage and so on. 

These methods are all completely absent from sutrayāna teachings. Sutrayāna is vehicle of the cause; Vajrayāna is the vehicle of the result.

Garab Dorje is the predicted teacher of Dzogchen, not Shakyamuni.

It is easy to say something does not accord with logic or reality and refuse to explain anything. Point one simply is a claim. Ok, you have made an unsubstantiated claim. 

Vasubandhu clearly states that whatever accords with dependent origination, etc., can be accepted as "buddhavacana" even if not spoken by Shakyamuni.

However, some narrow-minded people make assertions such as "Dzogchen is not buddhist because it was not taught by Shakyamuni Buddha." Other narrow minded people say "Anuttarayoga tantra is not buddhist because it was not taught by the Buddha", etc. .Still other narrow minded people say "Mahāyāna was not taught by by the Buddha", etc. 

Yet in each case, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and Dzogchen are successively held by their adherent not only to hold the central message of Buddhism, but illustrate the most essential and salient part of Buddhist teachings not expressed in "lower" yānas. Of course, these adherents can also be accused of narrow mindedness too (even if they are correct). 

So, yes, there are narrow minded people who reject teachings based on biased criteria. And for that they are at fault. 

As Shantideva points out, the ultimate of the lower system is the conventional of the higher system.

In general, the point of view of narrow minded people is that if something is not taught by Shakyamuni Buddha, it is not the teaching of the Buddha. 

Nyoshul Khen's approach is a bandaid applied to Nyingma Hermeneutics to avoid Gelug refutation. He is basically claiming -- since the dharmakāya of all buddhas is the same, any teaching of Samantabhadra is a teaching of Shakyamuni Buddha.  The converse would also have to be true, since Garab Dorje is a nirmanakāya, Shakyamuni's teaching of Vinaya is also Garab Dorje's teaching.  Thus, this idea is only formally true -- it is not historically true.

For example, both Shakyamuni and Garab Dorje are nirmanakāyas of Vajradhara. Vajradhara is an emanation of Samantabhadra. But Shakyamuni and Garab Dorje are not the same person. They lived in different bodies, at different times, and taught different teachings.

Like Ayurveda, the most important features of Tibetan Medicine are diet and lifestyle. There are secrets in Tibetan Medicine, but they are mostly related to creating mercury sulfide compounds. While the process is described in detail, still you need to have personal instruction. I know a couple of doctors who know how to make so called detoxified mercury, but it takes a long time and many people working together to do it safely. 

You should examine David Gordon White's book on Indian Alchemy. You will find it interesting.

Well, according to Sonam Tsemo, what actually happened was this: when the Buddha was a hell being he aroused great compassion for other hell beings, and asked the yamas whether he could take on the sufferings of other hell beings. In doing, after his head caught fire and he died, he was born first as a deva of Trāyāstriṁśā heaven, then as the son of the a potter in Jambudvipa. At that time, he met the ancient Buddha Shakyamuni and, offering that Buddha some porridge, generated bodhicitta. 

So while one may technically claim that one must by necessity generate bodhicitta in the presence of a buddha in the past, the necessary precondition for bodhicitta is compassion, and it is for that reason that Candrakirit cites compassion as the cause of all bodhisattvas. 

Whether the above events are true or are a parable is irrelevant -- the point is that compassion is the cause of bodhicitta and so therefore it is possible to say that one can become a bodhisattva without having ever met a Buddha. I would rate compassion as more important than a vow.

What HHDL means is that among religions there is no shared authority, no central committee deciding for everyone what is true and what is false. Recognizing the subjective nature of religious opinion, HHDL offers a more secular view. This is correct. To protect everyone's liberty, it is necessary to subordinate religious views to secular law i.e. insist on separation of church and state. 

Since there can be no agreement among various religions around which is the "true" religion -- tolerance is required. This however does not mean that if you are a Buddhist you are required to think that Christianity makes truths claims that are as valid as Buddhist truth claims. All that needs to be recognized is that all religions make truth claims that cannot be verified by any mutually agreed upon standard. 

So, I know for a fact that HHDL feels that Buddhism is the best religion. He also recognizes that this is just an opinion and insisting on this opinion to someone who does not share the same idea leads to strife and war. So rather than insisting that Buddhism is the best religion for everyone, he merely asserts it is the best religion for himself. 

Then, when we cross that divide, we try to look at people from the point of view of their goodness. We try to meet people at that point.

Since we cannot make all religions the same, we need to recognize where it is that people are the same. Where they are the same is that they want happiness and freedom from suffering -- and religions evolve to provide those answers, differently for different people.

The teachings a given nirmanakāya buddha teaches depends on the student. That is why it is taught that in contrast to the sambhogakāya five certainties (time, place, teacher, retinue and teaching) nirmanakāyas do not have certain time, place, teacher, retinue and teaching. For example, Sikhin Buddha never taught vinaya. He did not have a sangha of ordained bhiksus, etc.

Nirmanakāyas are emanations i.e. they only are a facet of full awakening display to sentient beings based on their karma. Thus the teachings they bestow are also based on the karma of those sentient beings.

There is no involvement with Shakyamuni in any Mahayoga Tantra in Nyingma. It is not necessary. Teaching of tantras is mainly a Sambhogakāya teaching. Nirmanakāyas do not possess the five certainties. 

In my personal opinion, these "proofs" that Shakyamuni Buddha was directly related to disseminating Anuttarayoga tantra are baseless.  

As I said, we have example where according to tradition, the Buddha manifested the mandalas of Kalacakra and Guhyasamaja. But manifesting a mandala and teaching are two different things altogether. Even here, while Indrabhuti spread the Guhyasamaja in his kingdom eventually the lineage died out. It was later revived by a Dakini who received it from Vajrapani, and bestowed both the Tattvasamgraha and the Guhyasamaja to King Visukalpa, who then spread it very widely in South India. In reality the author of the present recension of the Guhyasamaja Tantra is Indrabhuti. The author of the present recension of the Hevajra is Mahasiddha Virupa, etc.

When I said "The Buddha" I was referring to The Historical Buddha, Shakyamuni.

Even so, Shakyamuni did not actually teach the anuttarayoga tantras. He gave the empowerment of Guhyasamaja to Indrabhuti. Indrabhuti acheived awakening. Indrabhuti wrote down the Guhyasamaja after that point. Kalacakra is similar. Buddha manifested Kalacakra mandala in the Dhanyakataka stupa. Others wrote the tantra down at a later time. Chakrasamvara has never been connected with Shakyamuni indirectly or directly. Of course some scholars, mainly Gelugpas, in the past have gone to much trouble to prove otherwise. 

If you follow Nyingmapa tradition, you understand that King Jah received some text somehow, practiced Vajrasattva, had a vision and received the mahayoga tantras in that way.

The abhisheka mentioned in the Dasabhumi sutra and the Lanka-avatara is only bestowed upon tenth stage bodhisattvas. It is not a method that is taught for ordinary people.

This statement however fails to provide us with a path to realize that result in the direct manner that we refer to as "Dzogchen". Hence it is not Dzogchen. 

We can also interpret Manjushrinama samgiti as a dzogchen text. It is not however as Dzogchen text and does not explain Dzogchen directly.

The Dzogchen forum was closed because the discussion was becoming completely dominated by people from Dzogchen Community. 

The Bon forum was closed primarily because one: the narrative histories of Bon and Buddhism in Tibet are largely incompatible with each other, despite many doctrinal similarities, and two: E-Sangha was a Pan-Buddhist Web site.
