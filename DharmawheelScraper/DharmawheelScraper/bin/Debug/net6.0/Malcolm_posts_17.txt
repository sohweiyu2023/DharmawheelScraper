You run the risk of conflating practitioners called "yogācārins," with the Yogācāra school and its sūtras. 

When Vasubandhu refers to yogācārins here, he is not referring to followers of the Lankāvatara, etc., sūtras.

We can understand these so-called "yogācārins" to be different than the Yogācārins following Asanga, because for instance, Samghabhadra's commentary mentions yogācarins exactly four times, and only the context those who are meditating the impure dhyānas, as does Dignāga. Sthiramati only mentions these past masters called yogācārins eight times, and without any indication this refers to the school we presently know as Yogācāra.

And my point still stands that there is no evidence of the Sūtrasammucaya attributed to Nāgārjuna mentioned in any text prior to the 6th century.

The economy is not money. The economy is "the wealth and resources of a country or region, especially in terms of the production and consumption of goods and services." Don't see money anywhere in that definition (OED) or "the structure or conditions of economic life in a country, area, or period
also : an economic system." (MW)

So, what we are discussing here is the destruction of one set of conditions for economic life and replacing it with another. The problem here is that when people start naively militating against consumption, they usually have no real plan for how to go about it, other than platitudes about eating less meat and so on.

Your stats are based on an error published in a 2006 report, whose author admitted the error and submitted a revision. In fact, only 14.5 percent of global GHG emissions come from livestock. This is from the UN's FAO report: http://www.fao.org/3/CA1201EN/ca1201en.pdf. This is a significant amount, but it is not in the stratosphere as someone would think if they just took your stats at face value. It can also be cut by 30%, the report says, by changing certain practices.

In terms of percentages, livestock emit:

Gt CO2-eq of CO2 per annum, or 5 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions (IPCC, 2007)
3.1 Gt CO2-eq of CH4 per annum, or 44 percent of anthropogenic CH4 emissions (IPCC, 2007)

The seven branch prayer contains everything, including confession. That confession renews your refuge and bodhisattva vows. In the Sarma schools, there is a specific prayer called "the daily confession":

I rejoice in the merit of beings. 
I bear in mind the bodhicitta of the Buddhas. 
I go for refuge until awakening 
to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Supreme Sangha.
I generate bodhicitta 
in order to truly accomplish my own and others’ benefit.
Having generated supreme bodhicitta, 
I invite all sentient beings to practice the pleasing, supreme conduct of awakening.
May I accomplish Buddhahood 
in order to benefit migrating beings.

No.

When I studied Madhyamaka in the Sakya school, it was pure Madhyamaka. In general, Yogacāra is held to be a lower tenet system than Madhyamaka in most Tibetan Buddhist schools. 

The Sakya, Nyingma, and Gelug schools identify their view as Prasangika Madhyamaka, which is the purest form of Madhyamaka with no Yogacāra at all. This Madhyamaka tradition regards the so-called Yogacāra Sūtras, such as the Lanakāvatara, Samdhinirmocana, etc., to be provisional in meaning, not definitive in meaning. 

Some Kagyus and the Jonangpa school follow a kind of "Madhyamaka" in which the doctrines of the Yogacāra school are mixed with the Madhyamaka doctrine of two truths. But this synthesis has been subject to severe criticism for the past 600 years.

You should understand that Śāntarakṣita would have been astonished by such classifications. These are Tibetan classifications dating from late 12th century and later. 

Śāntarakṣita is termed a "Yogacāra Madhyamaka" by later Tibetans because he adopted the idea of appearances being mind-only (cittamatra), which occurs in several Mahāyāna sūtras. 

However, Śāntarakṣita severely critiques the mind-only perspective advanced by the Yogācāra school in texts such as the Tattvasaṃgraha, and so on, as did his disciple, Kamalaśīla in the commentaries the latter wrote on his master's works. \

So, better not to take such labels at face value.

No. Yogacāra really emerged only as an independent Mahāyāna school in the fifth and sixth century CE. Thus, the target of Nāgārjuna's critiques were only Abhidharmikas. 

Also, there was never a Yogacāra-Madyamaka merger, so to speak. 

Both Mādhyamika scholars and Yogācara scholars were working on the basis of the same sets of sūtras; but their understanding and classification of these sūtras differed. 

In any case, the pre-Yogacāra scholars would be Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva. Even though the latter's text has the colophon title "The Yoga Practice of Bodhisattvas (bodhisattvayogacārya) composed in Four Hundred Verses," this has nothing to do with the later Yogacāra School of Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu.

Speaking as someone who has trained extensively in Tibetan Medicine and Ayurveda, one has to be very careful with sattvic diets. Most people cannot do a pure sattvic diet, because in many cases it will lead to vatta aggravation. Also recall, that milk, ghee, honey, and so on, are also part of a sattvic diet. Many people try to a vegan version of this and really damage their health. Seen it with my own eyes, more than once. In general, most people need to have also a little tamasic food, for grounding, and rajasic food for energy.

As a well-published translator of Great Perfection material (five books), I can be quite frank about the fact that we are in the infancy of translating these texts. We all try to do our best, and and we all realize there is a long way to go. We all try no to be too harsh with each other, because we are all in the same boat. 

There are three important factors to look for in a Great Perfection translation, which is very hard to evaluate for those who do not know Tibetan: is the translator's Tibetan grammar solid? Have the translations been peer reviewed? In general, one is not going to find peer-reviewed translations that are self-published on Amazon and elsewhere. Finally, does the translator have practical experience as well as the necessary Buddhist training both within the Great Perfection tradition itself and general Buddhist philosophy? Who are their teachers? What transmission have they received? 

All of the texts we are translating now will have to be translated again 50 years. But for now, we do our best, because we are trying to help people attain buddhahood, not make a living off of book sales (if that was the goal, we would have all starved to death long ago).

In order to become a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, or a samyaksambuddha, one must first generate the bodhicitta of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, or a samyaksambuddha. In order to generate that bodhicitta, one must have a teacher under whom one generates that bodhicitta. For example, Śākyamuni generated the bodhicitta to become a buddha under Dipamkāra Buddha. Prayekabuddhas are not like mushrooms that spring up in a field after a thunder storm, without any apparent cause.

For example, the Subāhuparipṛcchā sūtra states:

"The vehicle of those of medium devotion, of medium capacity, who enjoy solitude, who err on the side of personal benefit, who are diligent in concentration and equipoise, and aspire to their own awakening is called the pratyekabuddhayāna...adherents of the pratyekabuddhayāna are dedicated to perfecting the pratyekabuddhayāna now and in the future."

The Daśacakrakṣitigarbha sūtra states:

Because the tathāgata is compassionate, sometimes he explains the dharma of the śrāvakayāna, sometimes he explains the dharma of the pratyekabuddhayāna, sometimes he explains the dharma of the unsurpassed yāna, and therefore, by the power of aspiration and by the power of the kalyānamitra, all misdeeds that are a result of negative actions are purified, and some obtain the result of the śrāvakayāna, some obtain nirvana through the pratyekabuddhayāna, and some realize the meaning of the extremely vast, unsurpassed yāna.

So this should put to rest the question of whether or not pratekabuddhas have teachers, since they clearly do have teachers, here called  kalyānamitras.

Pratyekabuddhas are those, who, under the tutelage of a samyaksambuddha, aspire to awaken as pratyekabuddhas in a time when there is no dispensation of a samyaksambuddha. 

In other words, in order to become a prayekabuddha, one must generate the bodhicitta of a pratyekabuddha. That means first one must have understood what a pratyekabuddha is, and that will only be understood at the feet of the teacher.

You forget, HPB was in contact with "mahatmas," Masters Koot Humi and Morya, and their disciple Dwaj Khul, supposedly a Tibetan disciple of the former, who make their first appearance in the Mahatma Letters.

Dwaj Khul is Bailey's "Tibetan."

For example, the The Saṃcayagāthā states:

The excellent disciple with devotion to the guru
always relies on learned gurus.
If it is asked for what reason, the qualities of being learned arise from them

...................

The victor, the owner of the best of all qualities, has said:
“Rely on the Buddha, Dharma, and the virtuous mentor.”


The Tattvāvatāra states:

The all-knowing one praises reliance on a guru,
not the independence of a disciple. 
A blind person is not independent, 
unable to climb a mountain. 



The Saṃcaya-gāthā states:

Just as a group of patients relies on medicine to be cured, 
one should rely unwaveringly upon a virtuous mentor. 

The Sutrālaṃkara:

Rely on a virtuous mentor who is disciplined, peaceful, pacified, 
diligent in the highest qualities, very learned,
understands the truth, eloquent, 
has a loving nature, and has abandoned regret. 


The Bodhicaryāvatāra states: 

The virtuous mentor 
skilled in the meaning of Mahāyāna and 
possessing the supreme disciplined conduct of a bodhisattva
should never be abandoned, even at the cost of one’s life.

The Ratnāvali states:

If you rely on those who
are content, compassionate, and disciplined, 
with discerning wisdom that removes afflictions,
through knowing them, give them respect.

The Gaṇḍāvyuha sūtra states:

Young Manibhadra, bodhisattvas who correctly adhere to the virtuous mentor do not fall into lower realms; they realize the uniformity of all phenomena; they are shown the paths of bliss and misery; they are instructed in the conduct of Samantabhadra; they are shown the path to the city of omniscience; they are carried to the place of omniscience...

The Ratnamegha-sūtra states:

Now then, since virtuous qualities will increase and nonvirtue will decline if one relies upon the guru, the preceptor [mkhan po, upādhyāyaḥ] will generate the thought of teaching those with greater or lesser hearing, or those with discipline or corrupted discipline.

Ārya Śrisambhava teaches in the Gaṇḍāvyuha sūtra:

The virtuous mentor comprehends incorrect actions, correctly turns one away from shameless places, extracts one from the city of samsara…Child of a good family, since one always thinks in that way, serve virtuous mentors.

So you see, also those interested in Mahāyāna must always rely on a teacher.

I never said that Sino-Japanese Buddhism was devoid of the four seals. 

What I said what was "any Buddhism that does not adhere to the three or four seals is not valid buddhadharma." For example, the Pudgalavādins, a Buddhist school that existed prior to the fall of the Gupta empire, and perhaps beyond, asserted the existence of an inexpressible self that was different than the aggregates, because they were unable to conceive rebirth in anything other than substantialist terms. They were roundly refuted on all sides. You can read about this in the Refutation of the Self composed by Vasubandhu. 

The point is that your contention that what others are calling a "soul" is just what Buddhists call "consciousness" is not a valid assertion.  

These kinds of theories exist in many forms, some of them belong to indigenous traditions where Buddhism has spread, such as the Tibetan cultural idea of bla; others are like the Chinese cultural idea of shen, hun, and po; kami in Japan, etc., some of them are a result of philosophical speculation, like the Upanishadic atman, the Christian soul, and so on. These concepts are virtually impossible to reconcile with buddhadharma, end of story, no matter who bitterly complains about my assertion out of misplaced grudges and resentments.

The term "soul" does not describe anything in Buddhadharma. The referent to which "soul" refers is negated in Buddhadharma. It has no existence at all, other than as a name. 

Consciousness is described in Buddhadharma, but it is explicitly denied by the Buddha that consciousness can be equated with something called a "soul" (atman).   

Now, there are Buddhisms which entertain all sorts of wrong views; much of which falls under the rubric of "Buddhism" is not Buddhadharma.

No, this is an error. When one dies, the next moment of consciousness appropriates an apparitional birth as a so-called gandharva in the intermediate state.

Then you should criticize the translation, rather than my objection to such ideas being represented as valid doctrines within Buddhadharma.  

These ideas have nothing to do with Buddhadharma, they are foreign to it. The point is not making allowances for Chinese, Tibetan, etc.,  cultural ideas. The point is to clearly distinguish cultural ideas from core Buddhadharma. 

Distinguishing Buddhadharma from Daoism, Confucism, etc. does not denigrate the latter. Pointing out that there is no holy ghost in Buddhadharma does not denigrate Trinitarian Christianity. Pointing out that there is no Allah in Buddhadharma does not denigrate Islam. 

The hun is something that in Daoism, etc., was considered to leave the body at death. Whether one calls this a spirit or a soul does not matter much, since this idea is foreign in every way to Buddhadharma.

The Tibetan concept of bla (pronounced "la") is irrelevant here, which in any case receives very limited treatment in Tibetan Buddhism, apart from Tibetan Medicine, elemental calculation, and some Nyingmapa rites (bla 'gugs, bla bslu), which presumably have some Bon antecedents. Even so, the pre-Buddhist concept of bla is quite attenuated in Tibetan Buddhism, and is basically considered to be a support for srog, lifeforce, and a synonym of tshe, longevity.

Mahāyāna Sutras, in Indian Buddhism, were grouped by subject matter, rather than by presumed time of teaching. There are three major groupings: Prajñāpāramita, Tathāgatagarbha, and Yogacāra. Then there are miscellaneous sūtras that do not clearly fall into this or that category such as the Bodhisattvapitika, the Samadhirāja, the Lotus, the Ratnakuta sūtras, and so on. 

Zhiyi's historical grouping has no precedent in Indian literature, and certainly is not how Tibetan Buddhists divide the teachings: which are generally divided into the three turnings: the first (Hinayāna), second (Provisional Mahāyāna), and third (Definitive Mahāyāna), based on a single passage from the Yogacāra Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. Depending upon school, the second and third are considered defintive, and there is much debate around which sūtras are included in which turning. Then of course there are the tantras, which have no place at all in Zhiyi's scheme. 

So, frankly, it is hard to have a conversation about this because the historical assumptions which are common in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism are not shared with the Sino-Japanese Buddhism and vice versa. 

For example, as far as I am concerned, the Prajñāpāramita sūtras are the most important Mahāyāna sūtras. Others in the Indo-Tibetan Buddhism tradition feel the Tathāgatagarbha and Yogacāra sūtras are the most important, and while they certainly agree the Prajñāpāramita sūtras are important, they feel their full import cannot be understood in absence of  the Tathāgatagarbha and Yogacāra sūtras. I on the other hand, being a Mādhyamika, regard Yogacāra sūtras as provisional, and Tathāgatagarbha sūtras as conditionally definitive, providing they are correctly interpreted, since their incorrect interpretation is nothing more that atmavāda. 

No one really reads the Lotus Sūtra in Tibetan Buddhism, it is just not that important in our tradition because it does not contain any doctrines that cannot be found in other sūtras as well. In fact, because of the heterogeneous nature of sūtras in general, these three main streams of sūtras were codified into the five treatises of Maitreya, which alongside the study of Nagārjuna's collection of reasonings, became the dominant focus of scholastic studies from the 6th century onward in India and then in Tibet. 

We see a recent reengagement with the sūtra tradition in the teachings of Dzongsar Khyentse and Khenpo Sodar and so on, but this is a sort of a modern rediscovery of sūtra literature by Tibetans, it is not the focus of the Tibetan Buddhist system, which focuses more attention on the exegesis of tantric scriptures such as the Guhyasamāja, and so on. Sūtras are there mainly to be ritually recited once or so a year for merit. They are not generally studied. Part of the reason for this is that the language sūtras are translated into tends to be archaic Tibetan, since most of the sūtras were translated during the imperial period (prior to 840 CE), whereas the treatises that form the basis of the study of scholastic Buddhism in Tibet were constantly revised and updated through the 14th century and the final compilation of the Tibetan canon by Buton Rinchen Drup. 

So, this will be a hard to discussion to have, simply because the historical assumptions which are common in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism are not shared with the Sino-Japanese Buddhism and vice versa.

He wrote one when he was quite young, the Lion's Roar of Extrinsic Emptiness. 

The more mature texts he wrote concerning Yogacāra materials were an attempt to reconcile Yogacāra with standard Madhyamaka, in which he resorts to interpretations of phrases in such yogacāra texts as the Dharmadharmatāvibhaṅga in ways that are impossible in Sanskrit, such as substituting snang ba for rig pa in the term rnam par rig (vijñāpti). There is no Sanskrit equivalent for rnam par snang ba. Someone working with Sanskrit texts would never try this kind of linguistic sleight of hand. So Mipham's interpretation only works in Tibetan, not Sanskrit. Therefore, we can understand it is removed from the original source texts. 

Khenpo Shenga's approach is more sound and conservative (though not as fun nor inventive) which is why he is the dominant influence in setting the curriculum for the Nyingma school in the early 20th century, and remains so up to this day.

So you cannot really claim that he was removed by time and geography. Even today, Hsuan Tsang remains the dominant figure in Chinese Yogacara.

Tibetans used to carry gaus filled with sacred things in order to protect them from bullets and so on. It still didn't stop Chinese machine guns from mowing them down in large numbers in 1959, when the Khampas tried to repell the Chinese invasion of Lhasa. 

These kinds of things have a place, but one cannot rely on them at the expense of common sense. For example, during this corona virus many amulets are being distributed on line like this one:

Gyerphung is considered in the Derge edition of the ZZ, in the  Rje ta pi hri tsa'i lung bstan, to be a contemporary of Trisong Deutsan.

The way it declined can be understood from the line of chronicles like the index. At that time, Gyerphung Chenpo Nangsher Lodpo...etc."

There is a problem with this text however, as it places Ligmincha as a contemporary of Trisong Deutsan, but this, as ChNN and other scholars have shown, is historically wrong. Ligmincha was in fact a contemporary of and assassinated by Srongtsan Gampo.

No, it is measured by four things; the object; the afflcition; the deed itself; and the resultant satisfaction. If there is no satisfaction in the deed, then the vipaka of the karma is considerably weaker, and may never ripen. See chapter 4 of the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ for a full detailing of karma and is results. 

It is true that killing an animal of any kind is a nonvirtue, but that is not what the first root precept concerns: it only concerns killing human beings. If a lay person kills an ant, they have not broken the first precept, even though they have committed a nonvirtuous deed.

In short, some Indian Buddhists commonly accepted that feticide was only a homicide after a certain number of weeks, generally after the stage of six sense organs, and as long as 19 weeks, if one was following the Ayurvedic understanding of the periods of gestation.

In other words, Mādhyamikas conventionally accept the notion that a sense consciousness will not arise in absence of the sense organ and sense object, but they do not accept that any of these things are substantially real or exist independently of one another.

People are born into families. Those families live in countries. Those countries tend to have dominant religions. 

In any case, my point still stands, if someone is born lacking the eighteen freedoms and endowments, they do not have a precious human birth. In case anyone does not know the eight lack of freedoms, they are described by Nāgājruna:

Birth as one holding wrong views, as animals, pretas, and hell beings, 
as one without the teaching of the victor, or in a border country,
birth as a barbarian, as one stupid and dumb,
or birth as any of the long-lived gods
are the eight faults of lacking freedom. 


The ten endowments are divided into five personal endowments, and five external endowments. The personal endowments are:

A human born in the central country, complete sense organs, 
not engaging in wrong livelihood, faith in the object.

The external endowments are:

The Buddha has arrived, he has taught the Dharma, 
the doctrine exists, there are followers of that,

Had you written "isn't championing women's rights in opposition to championing the right to respect life even on a cellular level the same as the converse?"

My answer would have been the same in all respects. You can champion the right to respect cellular life, but it is meaningless cause. What are you going to do, go out and hold up posters in front of drug companies and demand that they respect cellular life?

In short, restricting women's access to safe abortions is both short-sighted and lacking in compassion.

Well, you have to take into account that the whole debate about abortion comes from Christians who believe they only have one life, this one, after which the soul goes to heaven or hell. 

They also believe in original sin; so, from their religious point of view, abortion is extremely serious. 

Now, from our point of view, we believe in rebirth. If a being in the intermediate existence is conceived and aborted, this does not ruin that beings's chance at a human rebirth. 

Also, as long as the abortion is performed prior to 19 weeks, the fetus will suffer no pain because, in Buddhist texts, it is stated that a fetus will only have operational sense organs from 19th week onward. 

Stating that something is or is not permissible by a strict rule is not the Mahāyāna way. In Mahāyāna, motivation is more important than the action.

Those who support a woman's right to choose are not imposing beliefs on anyone, since any woman who believes abortion is wrong is free to choose not to have an abortion should they do not want one.

It is not so clear. While it is true that if a monk causes an abortion after the 19th week, it is a parajika, prior to the 19th week it is not. 

As far as paying for abortions. It is interesting you mention abortion, but not war. 

The fact is, that your belief that abortion is wrong is only a belief, and it is not shared by others. 

We do not pay taxes based on what personally believe. I don't like the fact that Christians get massive federal subsidies for their charter schools, but our taxes get spent on that too. 

Basically, you are entitled to believe in whatever you like, but you are not entitled to force your religious beliefs on others. It is a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment to do so.

Whether abortion is legal or not, women will continue to seek abortions. Where it is outlawed, or where access to abortion is restricted, women’s lives are placed in danger. So, one either chooses to understand that women need to be able to make this choice on their own, and wrestle with their own conscience, or keep dying because of illegal and botched abortions performed in back ally clinics. It’s more of a public health issue than anything else. And all arguments against abortion are religious in origin, none are based in science.

I, for one, do not want to have other people’s religious opinions, principally the opinions of men, turned into laws that affect a woman’s right to treat her own body as she needs.

Content:
Your statement is false. 

In Buddhism, abortion is only considered the taking of a human life after the 19th week. How do we know this? A bhikṣu etc., only commits parajika, a complete defeat, if he causes an abortion after the 19th week. Prior to that, causing an abortion is not considered killing a human being. 

All of the arguments against abortion hinge on religious beliefs. Therefore, they violate the establishment clause of the first amendment.

Nah, the Tibetan Gvt.,  religious, and aristocratic establishment was throughly corrupt and brutal. And, Tibetan politics had been dominated by China since the mid 18th century, apart from a 40 year or so hiatus after the fall of the Qing dynasty, and the inevitable war between the Kuomintang and the PLA. 

The disintegration of the Tibetan Empire was partly an outcome of the reasons you mention, though Tibet's role as a conquerer has always been overstated, both by themselves and by some lazy historians. They were more like raiders than conquerers.

Just as long ago, Sakra, the king of the gods, thinking of the profound meaning of the Great Mother, the Perfection of Wisdom, and in dependence on the might and power of reciting the words was able to ward of evil Māra, and so on, likewise, also by our thinking of the profound meaning of the Great Mother, the Perfection of Wisdom, and in dependence on the might and power of reciting the words, by the power of the truth of the Three Noble Jewels, may all that is contrary to me and my companions’ practice of the sublime Dharma be repelled immediately! (clap) May it be prevented! (clap) May it be pacified! (clap) May it be totally pacified! (clap)

There has been a lot of recommendations one sees in various places on line for what kinds of practices one should be doing during this time. Here is my list of essential practices. Most of these are concerned with pacifying the eight classes, In particular, these diseases are spread by Mamos. 


Orgyen Menlha/Medicine Buddha-- best to do for people when they are ill. 

Chod practice for those who are ill. 

Preventative practices:

Riwo Sangchod-- this or any general rite of Sang is important for everyone to do during this time because these outbreaks are always a result of our general contamination and disrespect of the environment, as well as violation of our three vows. This practice is used to purify ourselves, and in this way, acts as a rite of repelling.  

Wrathful pratices such as Takhyung Barwa, Guru Dragpgur, Dorje Drollo, Vajrapani, and so on, which are used to pacify and control the eight classes. 

The Golden Libation for the Eight Classes by Nubchen (degyed serkhyem), again, used to appease local deities, etc.

Parnashavari is particularly effective in this time. 

Dorje Gotrab, but one needs to do a three day silent retreat on this practice. 

Tārā, especially the 20th Tārā mantra. 

Reciting Barche Kunsel and Sampa Lhundrup.

For those who do not have Vajrayāna empowerment, reciting the Heart Sutra with the repelling rite is effective.  

Obtain and wear a Nagpo Gujor pill. Consult your guru for how to use it best. 

Wash your hands frequently, reciting the Seven Line prayer to Padmasambhava slowly while doing so = three happy birthdays. 

Stay home and practice.

Right, and when discussions on upaya are addressed, the burning house metaphor is invoked, but in general, the sūtra usually resorted to to explain upaya is the Upāyakauśalya Sūtra, which is usually relied upon more, probably because that is the source of the sea captain murdering the thief trope. But in terms of buddhological doctrine, the important points of the Lotus are not so much about upaya, because there are many sutras that address this, but rather, primordial buddhahood and ekayāna, because there are not so many sutras that address those two points.

The orgins of the this idea lay the notion of the transformation of the mind stream. The basic idea is that the mind contains seeds, which are activated when meeting specific causes for arising.

Well, highest yoga tantra has thirteen stages. Some schools interpret these merely adding two more stages to the bodhisattva path, other schools understand this as being actual stages of buddhahood. The locus classicus of the thirteen stages is the Samputa Tantra, which pretty explicitly states that buddhas of the eleventh and twelfth bhumi have slightly defective omniscience. In yoga tantra on down, buddhahood is the eleventh stage.

That is not a refutation, that is not even a consequence. For example, in order to show that I was mistaken, you would need to show that Nāgārjuna's intent was that emptiness, in that verse, intended ultimate truth; and that dependent designation intended relative truth (they don't). You cannot rely on a vague legal principle like "penumbra" to explain this away, that somehow this third truth was lurking there all along, just waiting to be discovered by Zhiyi, mystically concealed in the Lotus Sutra by the Buddha. 

I have already provided scriptural citations flat out denying there is such a thing as third truth, etc., as well as citations which show how this verse intended to be understood. As far as I am concerned, the whole discussion is based on Chinese Buddhist misunderstandings of the intent of Nāgārjuna, misunderstandings that continue to this day because people refuse to study these things properly.

Zhiyi would not have read the Sūtralāṃkāra, it was not translated into Chinese until 630. 

And this is just a reference to to the three natures, the imputed, the dependent, and the perfected. What are these? The verse is, "Since the emptiness of the nonexistence is know, and likewise, since the emptiness of the existent and natural emptiness is known, one is called the knower of emptiness."  The first is the imagined, the second is the dependent (aka all-basis consciousness), and the third of the perfected (the absence of the imputed in the dependent). 

Now. in Vasubandhu's commentary on Maitreya's verse (this text was not written by Asanga), he comments that the first emptiness is the imputed nature; the second is the dependent nature, and the third is the perfected nature. But again, this is a question of perception, and it is clarified more readily by the Madhyānatavibhańgakāriks̄:

The imagination of the unreal exists;
duality does not exist in it;
emptiness exists in this;
and the former exists in the latter.

Since everything is explained 
as not empty and not not-empty, 
since there is existence, since there is nonexistence, and since there is existence,
that is the middle way. 

The first line of the first verse explicitly explains the appearances of the triple realm, that is, the imagination of the unreal (parikalpita), that is, the imagination of subject and object exists. However, that duality does not exist, and in fact, it is exists as the imagination of an unreal subject and object. The former, duality, exists in the latter, emptiness, which is to say duality exists in a consciousness that is empty of duality. 

Now, here emptiness and the imagination of the unreal both exist (not empty), but they are empty of duality (not not-empty). The imagination of the unreal is all compounded phenomena, and emptiness is uncompounded, hence, this explains all phenomena. Therefore, the imagination of the unreal exists, duality does not exist, but that emptiness of that duality does exist; and since everything is not wholly empty and everything is also not wholly non-empty, that is the middle way as described by Maitreyanatha. 

To say that not everything is wholly empty is to say that everything exists as a projection of a deluded consciousness; to say that everything is not wholly nonempty is to say that the projections of that deluded consciousness do not exist. This is Maitreyanatha'ss formula of the middle way.  

This presentation is completely different than what Zhiyi is getting at. Zhiyi is trying to reconcile a substantialist misunderstanding of Madhyamaka that plagued earlier Chinese scholars, who mistook epistemology of the two truths for an ontology. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, Zhiyi never totally overcame this ontology, and still continued this misunderstanding, even as he tried to resolve it.

"Support" is exactly now to put it. It is like arguing case law. In a legal argument, you need to find support for your position in previous cases, precedents, etc., which support your present argument. But in this case, there is no way you can argue that the Lotus sutra supports a three truth position: a) because Zhiyi's three truths violate the law of the excluded middle, etc. The only place you can go from here is mystical irrationalism. That's fine, but mystical irrationalism is not acceptable in Buddhadharma.

Do you know what an excluded middle is? For example, when confront with a choice: true or false, there is no third choice. The middle is excluded because, for example, between a false cognition and a true cognition, there is no third option, a true cognition that is false, or a false cognition that is true. 

Quite frankly, Zhiyi's argument fails the excluded middle test, rendering his position irrational. Nāgārjuna himself never violates the law of the excluded middle. 

When we understand that the two truths refer to cognitions of objects, rather than objects themselves, then we can understand very clearly that the two truths are describing the experiential mode of perception of worldly beings on the one hand, and the experiential mode of perception of āryas in equipoise on the other. 

Worldly beings can conceptually infer ultimate truth (otherwise, they could never realize it); but even that inference is not their experiential mode of perception, since an inference too is just a relative truth, even in mundane equipoise.

No third step is needed. Why? Because there is no excluded middle in the two truths. It is not like the two truths leaves something out that needs to further supplied. As I mentioned before, the two truths are objects of cognitions, true and false respectively. In order to have a third third truth, one would have to have an object of a cognition that was at the same time true and false. And that is impossible.

This is unwarranted. Nagārjuna was certainly aware of the Meeting of the Father and Sun Sūtra (ārya-pitāputra-samāgamana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra) where it is emphatically stated there is no third truth.

 There there is the Discourse of Ultimate and Relative Truth Sūtra (ārya-saṃvṛti-paramārtha-satya-nirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra). No mention of "three truths" there either. 

Finally, notion of a third truth contradicts not only sūtra, but it also contradicts the writings of Nāgārjuna himself.

In very simple terms, yes. When we do not recognize an affliction is in play, this causes us to engage in an action, and that action ripens as suffering. When we recognize an affliction is in play, we can refrain from carrying out the action it would otherwise cause, and thus, that suffering will not arise for use as a result in the future.

The two truths describe how ordinary people falsely perceive the world on the one hand, and how awakened people on the bodhisattva stages correctly perceive the world on the other hand. That's all. End of story. 

Zhiyi's three truths are a way of understanding the Nāgārjuna passage I posted yesterday—that is, a way of understanding what being empty, dependently designated, and the middle way means. It is useful for people who want to study these things to understand where they come from and their roots. 

However, when we get right down to it, what is that which is empty, dependently designated and the middle way? Dependently originated phenomena, which are empty and dependently designated, and the middle way. 

The whole point is that dependent origination is the middle way, the middle way between asserting existence or nonexistence with respect to phenomena. Because dependently originated phenomena are empty, they are free from the extreme of existence; because phenomena are dependently designated, they are free from the extreme of nonexistence. That is what it means to say that dependent origination is the middle way. So when we look at what Nāgārjuna is actually talking about in this passage, he is just talking about the central insight of the Buddha, dependent origination, and nothing more. 

The main thing we need to understand in Buddhism is dependent origination, since dependent origination is the central theme of the Buddha's Dharma. If we do not understand dependent origination, we won't understand anything else of the Buddha's teaching. As the Buddha said, "Whoever sees dependent origination, sees the Dharma; whoever sees the Dharma, sees me."

So if we are going to discuss the role of truth in Buddhism, the role of truth in Buddhism is to discover the truth of dependent origination and nothing more.

When you show me a sūtra that teaches three truths, rather than two, that will be a different story. But such a sūtra does not exist. Thus the Buddha only taught two truths. 

Now, with respect to the so-called "three truths," Nāgarjuna said:

Whatever arises in dependence
that is empty, 
that is dependently designated, 
that is the middle way.
Why? There exist no phenomena 
which do not originate dependently.
Therefore, there are no phenomena
which are not empty.


Now, I understand that Zhiyi took these three terms, and he decided that the middle way reconciled the first two terms. However, in reality, all three terms are merely synonyms for dependent origination. Whatever is dependently originated is empty and dependently designated, and that is the middle way. There is no need to call these "three truths." Buddhapalita (not a Tibetan) explains:

I explain that whatever arises dependently to be empty. That is dependently designated. That is the middle way. Therein, if there is some entity which exists, that is dependently originated and dependently designated. Why? Because there are no phenomena which are not dependently originated, therefore, there are no phenomena which are not empty.

"Emptiness," "dependent designation," and "middle way" are absolute synonyms for dependent origination. But this passage is not actually about the two truths at all, let alone three truths. This passage concerns the meaning of the profound truth that the Buddha taught, dependent origination, the madhyama-pratipad, i.e. the middle way, and nothing else.

Tathāgatagarbha is a sūtra tradition, but in India, as far as we know, it never developed into a coherent philosophical school, likely due to the fact that post Tathāgatagarbha sūtras like the Lanka relegated tathāgatagarbha to the position of being a doctrine taught for people who were afraid of emptiness. 

Thus, while Tibetan and Sino-Japanese schools raised the tathāgatagarbha theory to an elevated level of philosophical discourse, there is virtually no discussion of it in the classical Indian period apart from Maitreyanatha's survey text on tathāgatagarbha sūtras, the Uttaratantra and its commentary.

As I have tirelessly pointed out, the three turnings are mainly a historical device adopted by certain Tibetan historians on the basis of the Korean master Wongchuk's massive commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. 

But what is interesting is that the Indian masters seemed completely disinterested in commenting on this scheme, and it was not adopted by all Tibetan scholars as meaningful. I think that this is because when you look at the claim that the third turning is substantially different in content, when the citation itself is examined, we find that all it really says is that the third turning is merely an emphatic restatement of the definitive context of the second turning.

Yes, this is ideal, but for example, when HH Dalai praises HH Sakya Trichen as a "perfect teacher," if we think HHDL is an awesome person (he is), then this is sufficient information to feel confident in receiving teachings from this teacher. When it comes to the lineage heads in general, there should be no problem. The issue arises with teachers of lesser reputation and fame. When one is a beginner in Tibetan Buddhism, it is better to start off with teachers of known reputations, lineage heads, like HHDL, HHST and his sons, the Karmapa (choose one), HH Dudjom Rinpoche Pema Shepa Dorje, Shechen Rabjam, Drikung Khyabgon, Lama Zopa, etc. Then, when you have a little more experience and "know the turf" you can then seek out other teachers when you know how to follow a guru in a proper way.

Your assertion, "the relative is reliant on the absolute" is unsupportable, especially when one has no experience of the ultimate truth. For commoners such as we, the ultimate can be only be inferred through reasoning, since we have not had a direct perception of emptiness. So, it is quite the opposite: the ultimate depends on the relative, since it is only through analysis of relative truths that one arrives at ultimate truth. This is especially the case since the two truths are different ways of seeing conventionally-designated entities, one false, one true. However, both perceptions are based on examining relative entities that do not exist as ultimate. The ultimate itself is not something which is expressible in words. In other words, there is nothing that can be identified as the "absolute." Emptiness is also empty. 

With respect to traditions, far as I am concerned, there are only two common Mahāyāna traditions: the Yogacāra tradition of Maitreya and Asanga and the Madhyamaka tradition of Nāgārjuna and his sons—the former being provisional and the latter definitive—with awakening, liberation, and omniscience being possible only for those who realize the meaning of the latter, the Madhyamaka tradition.

Look, it is pretty simple. When one analyzes something, whatever is left over is "ultimate," because this is the limit of one's analysis. For example, for Sarvastivadins, water is a relative truth, and its wetness and limpidity are ultimate, since for them, this is as far as they carry the analysis. For a Madhyamaka, water is a relative truth, and it is also empty of all extremes, because one cannot take any analysis further than a total deconstruction of ontological assertions about this or that given thing—hence, emptiness is ultimate truth for Madhyamaka. 

But there is no such thing as an ultimate that exists separate from a relative entity. There is no polarization between relative truth and ultimate truth. Relative truth is a truth about a thing prior to analysis, for example, stating, "This is a car." If you and another person perceive the same car, this is relative truth. When both of you analyze the car, you will both find there is no car either in the parts, in one of the parts, or separate from the parts. There is a seven-fold analysis used by Candrakīrit to illustrate this.  

Indeed, the problems arise when people begin to hypostasize the two truths, as if they are somehow independent domains. They are not. All entities bear two natures, one relative, the other ultimate. Why? Because all phenomena are empty. As the Heart Sūtra states,  "Matter is empty, emptiness is matter; there is no matter apart from emptiness, and no emptiness apart from matter" and so on for the rest of the aggregates, etc.  

The Buddha explained his definitive Mahāyāna teachings in terms of the two truths. As Nāgārjuna puts it:

The doctrine of the buddhas
truly relies on two truths:
the relative truth of the worldly
and the ultimate truth of the sublime.
Those who do not understand
the distinction between the two truths
do not know the profundity
of the doctrine of the buddhas.

So, that's it. You can either accept the Nāgārjuna's word, and devote oneself to the study of the true intention of the Buddha, or you can waste time chasing mirages. Not only this, but a third truth is emphatically denied in Madhyamaka, so whatever reason Zhiyi had for concocting a third truth in the Chinese Buddhist context, it is irrelevant to Madhyamaka proper. For this reason, Chandrakīrti refers to the Sūtra on the Meeting of the Father and the Son (Āryapitāputrasamāgamananāmamahāyānasūtra):

The truth of the knower of the world
was seen for yourself, not received from another.
Those are relative and ultimate:
there is no third truth.

Duckworth is making an argument that defends yogacāra as a phenomenology, rather than an ontology-- following another modern scholar, Dan Lusthaus. This is a fashionable stance in the modern academy, but it is certainly isn't what Mipham is actually up to. All Mipham is trying to do is reconcile Yogacāra with Madhyamaka analysis. 

Mipham, an amazing scholar, was fond of trying adopting novel positions and also of trying to restore deprecated Madhyamaka scholars like Śantarakṣita (8th century), whose Madhyamaka-alaṃkara is considered to be a Yogacāra/Madhyamaka synthesis to the extent that he accepts the idea that all phenomena can be mind-only conventionally. However, apart from that, Śantarakṣita never uses any specifically yogacāra concepts such as the all-basis consciousness, the three natures, etc. in the course of his treatise.

In this case, "false" means mistaken with respect to the nature of the object that is being cognized, simply put, apprehending that things exist by way of their own nature, as opposed to veridical cognitions, which directly apprehend absence of existence by way of inherent existence, aka emptiness. 

When discussing the relative truth, Candra again divides this into a functional relative, and a nonfunctional relative: the former being conventional truths upon which we all agree, such as the earth being round; as opposed to the false relative, the belief that the earth is flat. 

Candra's definition of conventional depends on the notion of functionality (ārthakriya).

If the two truths are subject to interpretation, and there is more than one way of presenting them, then they are not the two “truths.” Among Madhyamikas, there are slight pedagogical differences in presenting relative truth, depending on whether we are addressing nonbuddhists or buddhists, but among madhyamikas, there are no real differences when it come to the meaning of the two truths.

No, existence in the form of five aggregates is not a single entity. The whole point of the Buddha teaching the five aggregates was to defeat the notion that there is a single entity which constitutes a person. There is no single entity in which there is obfuscation or lack of obfuscation. The five aggregates cannot be construed to be a single entity, otherwise, they would not have the name "five aggregates." Actually, the five aggregates are the five sense organs, the five sense objects, fifty four mental factors (when sensation and perception are included), and consciousness, for a total of 65 separate factors (and if you add the four primary elements and the eleven derived elements, there are a total of 80 separate factors).

The two truths are modes of cognition of a single entity. The first mode is cognition mistaken about the apprehended object, the second is a cognition unmistaken about the apprehended object. 

You continue to reference a "buddhanature," but it is not at all clear what you mean by the term. If buddhanature is conceived as a real entity encased with impurities, etc. this is a provisional view at best and a wrong view at worst. If, on the other hand, it is understood as the potential for sentient beings to wake up and realize buddhahood, then this is a correct view. In some presentations, buddhanature is equated with the luminous original nature of the mind, but this term "luminous" is actually just a synonym of emptiness, and refers to the intrinsic purity of all phenomena. Because of that intrinsic purity, we all have the potential to realize that intrinsic purity and wake up.

You definitely missed something along the way. Vipassana focuses on the so-called three marks of existence: anitya, dukkha, and anatman, that is, impermanence, suffering, and the absence of personal identity. 

Mahāyāna vipaśyāna by contrast focuses in the two fold emptiness: the absence of identity of persons and phenomena. The latter is not taught in the Śrāvaka canon at all.

When I am across, I'll send the raft back, I won't just throw it away. Someone else might need it.

And if samsara does not exist, then of course there is not even a pinhead of happiness in it, since it does not exist.

On the other hand, "ultimately nonexistent" does not mean samsara is like a barren women's child. It seems like you are using the ultimate to negate the relative, but that is a wrong view. I sure you would not commit that error, since you have proclaimed yourself to be on the other side, and therefore, to possess omniscience.

Despite my feelings of gratitude, I would understand this to be a sign of the the suffering of illness and death. If the doctor were to question me about the nature of suffering, I would be perfectly frank with them, and explain how the Buddha describes three or more kinds of suffering, including the suffering of change. 

In short, there is no happiness in samsara, not even the size of the head of a pin.

No, this is not correct. Sems sde was integrated with Vajrayāna practice—it was and is never practiced as a stand-alone system. Norbu Rinpoche mentioned this many times.

Not exactly. It is a little different. Generally, the guru introduces one to this knowledge. Then you practice this knowledge. Then you realize this knowledge. Sometimes this is referred to as the outer guru, inner guru, and secret guru. But when one is practicing the creation stage, there is no deity from the clarity and emptiness of one's mind.

84,000 pays $250 per folio side. People pay, are getting paid, etc. Nothing is free. In this case, since the main donor for this project is a millionaire several times over, it is no sweat of his or her back since most of those millions were donations anyway, to begin with. Someone always pays. The metaphysics we attach to this or that economic exchange is not the measure of whether someone paid something or not. 

If you try to buy books from the BDK, you have to pay for them. If you want to download the PDF, well, that is "free."

Thus far, 84000 has avoided printing its books. If they were to print them, it is like that they would have to charge for them. Nothing is free. Someone always pays.

Well, when people start invoking traditional Buddhist values, I think it is only fair to serve them up. People with less financial resources should understand too that every dollar they spend on Dharma brings them more merit. So, they should not complain if some Dharma program is out of their reach because of finances. They should understand that do not have the merit to participate. I myself have experienced this many times, and still do. I cannot afford to go to all the programs I would like to attend.
