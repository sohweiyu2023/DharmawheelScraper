Saṃkhya ideas also show up explicitly in other Indian Buddhist Tantras, such as the Samputa. It is very likely they penetrated Budddhist texts via Ayurveda. 

Perhaps the earliest text treatment of Samkhya we have is presented in the Carakra Saṃhita, when Caraka provides proofs for rebirth by positing an atman, and then outlining the Saṃkhya system. 

The other main place where Buddhism and Samkhya are mismatched, is that in Buddhism in general, the five elements are regarded as primary, from which everything springs, whereas in the Samkhya system the five elements are the grossest aspect of tamas and are the last things to evolve.

Dzogchen Tantras like the Self-Arisen Vidyā take special pains to negate Saṃkhya, from the recognition that the two systems can be easily confused for one another. 

I had meant to add that Patanjali, those who do not know the idea of purusha get lost in sattva, forever contemplating only on this most subtle aspect. Buddhists, I believe, were his main targets with this charge. 

Kalacakra's Saṃkhya is modified because purusha in this system is replaced with emptiness.

Prakriti does not in fact change. It's evolutions are a product of purusha not recognizing itself, thus cause the three gunas to appear to transform. When meditating according to the Samkhya system, even getting the buddhi/mahat level, the most sattvic level is still a deviation. Patanjali speaks about yogis who get involved with the most subtle level of the three gunas, without realizing that even the most subtle aspect of sattva is still not the self, not the purusha. It is only when purusha turns back on itself, resting its own radiance, that the apparent, but unreal evolutions of a real prakriti cease. Prakriti is as real as Purusha, both are permanent, but samsara comes about from not knowing (āvidya) that the evolutes produced out from prakriti are not itself. When it is known (vidyā) that the display of prakriti is not the self, then the purusha turns away from prakriti and one reaches the state of kaivalya. Basically, what happens is that the radiance of purusha illuminates prakriti, because while purusha is sentient, prakriti is not sentient. Purusha mistakes its radiance reflected back to itself off of prakriti as other. Saṃkhya is a very interesting, rational system. But it is realist and eternalist in characteristic.

You're being a little hysterical here.

It merely shows that Buddhists have strong differences of opinion over the question of the intrinsic evil of Islam as an entity, divorced from its monotheistic ideology held in common with Christianity and Judaism. Arguably, Christianity is the most pernicious and aggressive religious movement in history, and continues to be so.

Red herring of all red herrings. 

The problem with Harris is that he blames Muslims for not being sufficiently Western and liberal. This is why I think he is a bigot. He targets Islam, and Muslims for special venom in his writing, etc. This is amazingly clear evidence of his bigotry:


4. It is perfectly possible—and increasingly necessary—to speak about the ideological roots of Islamism and jihadism, and even about the unique need for reform within mainstream Islam itself, without lapsing into bigotry or disregarding the suffering of refugees. Indeed, when one understands the problem for what it is, one realizes that secular Muslims, liberal Muslims, and former Muslims are among the most desirable allies to have in the West—and, indeed, such people are the primary victims of Islamist intolerance and jihadist terror in Muslim-majority countries.

Muslims became radicalized when Western powers started attacking Muslims. Muslims did not start attacking the West. 

He continues to talk about "reform within mainstream Islam itself," while having zero expertise in Islam, being completely ignorant of its history, tradition, language, and doctrines. 

He then says:

6. The next acts of jihadist terrorism to take place on American soil will most likely be met with terrifyingly blunt (and even illegal) countermeasures by the Trump administration. If all that liberals can do in response is continue to lie about the causes of terrorism and lock arms with Islamists, we have some very rough times ahead.

The cause of terrorism from Muslim countries is Western economic imperialism. Harris does not understand, or refuses to understand the real causes of violence that is coming against the West from the Muslim world. And even here, that violence is minimal, compared to the violence that competing factions fighting resource wars against each other in the Middle East, etc. are inflicting upon one another. Harris' point of view is rooted in bigotry because it does not address the real issues and relies on scapegoats.

My intellectual distaste for monotheism as a socio-religious-economic system is distinct from my lack of sympathy for Harris' politics of scapegoating.

Different day, different point. You will note that I do not spare Christianity nor Judaism from the charge that they are religions essentially founded on the basis of culture wars and ethnic cleansing. 

What we are witnessing now is a fundamentally Christian exercise of power over the Muslim world. Terrorism against Western populations is a direct consequence of US wars of aggression the Middle East, and the failure of an anti-Commiunist foreign policy that made crucial policy errors in the 50's, not limited to the CIA's replacement of Mosedeq with the Pahlavi family in Iran. 

I fully understand the anxiety of Europeans who are fearful. I also think that the Harris response, i.e., to try and blame Muslim terrorist behavior on books absurd. 

The difference between what I am saying and what Harris says is that I am saying is that monotheism itself is the problem, not any of its particular expressions. 

I am not apologizing for Islam, I saying that Harris is a bigot who has problems with Muslims based on their belonging to a religion. For example he claims:

 "While the other major world religions have been fertile sources of intolerance, it is clear that the doctrine of Islam poses unique problems for the emergence of a global civilization...The only future devout Muslims can envisage—as Muslims—is one in which all infidels have been converted to Islam, politically subjugated, or killed."

This statement is such absolute bullshit coming from a person who lives among Fundie Christians in the US. His laughable defense of the Second Iraq war is equally pathetic. 

He summarizes, "It is not at all clear how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world." Yes, it is not at all clear when one engages in dehumanizing and humiliating others based on what you imagine they believe.

Hatred for Muslims is often racist in character, since what people are reacting to is ethnicity, not religion. Muslims are, by and large, not white people. Religion is just used as an excuse. For example,look at the way Catholics were treated in the US. Irish, Germans, and Italians were all represented with characteristics that were at best subhuman in the press of the day. Most of the so called "anarchists" who were tried in US courts were from Catholic countries, Saco and Vanzetti being just one famous example of Catholics being tried and convicted of crimes in which they had no involvement. 

However, perhaps "racist" is the wrong word for Harris. I would settle for "bigot."

Virupa. However, Virupa had many signs, but since he never received the intimate instructions connected with Vajrayogini from his gurus, he did not properly understand the signs he was having, and interpreted them as bad omens and signs of failure. Thus he became despondent, tossed his mala in the toilet, which led to his dream of Nairatmya, and his subsequent meeting with her in human form. She then sorted him out, and he achieved six bhumis in six days as a result of her teachings. 

Personal experience indicates to me that signs are better, and that they often come before one has done a complete number or time. For me the worst practice was mandala, and it was the practice in which I had the best signs. Then the rest of my retreat was a breeze. 

The Sakya approach to Ngondro has always been much less number oriented anyway —&nbsp;classically it was based on time periods, one month of this, then that, etc.. The number trip is a rather modern thing for Sakyapas. I did follow it, actually, but in retrospect, I would have done things a little differently. In any case, no matter, I finished my retreat. Another thing, the signs I had from mandala I did not recognize at the time as being specific to mandala, etc. But later on, some years later, I read a commentary that specified the signs of each of the ngondro practices and I can report that I had those experiences.

For example, in Sakya they have a system where one can visualize oneself as a Hevajra, and practice it as a yidam. One can also practice Hevajra Guru yoga where one visualizes the guru as the mandala of Hevajra. But theory behind each practice is completely different. They are separate paths. The latter bypasses creation and completion stage completely. 

In Nyingma they have many practices related to Guru Rinpoche. For example, in Dudjom Tersar it is common to practice Drollo as the Guru, Kilaya as the Yidam, and Troma as the Dakini, for blessings, siddhis, and activities respectively. 

In Konchok Chidu, we have the outer, inner, and secret guru, Pema Obar, Guru Dragpo, and Simhamukha as guru deva and dakini. 

But in the end, it is the practice of guru yoga that is most important in all schools.  All a Nyingma practitioner really needs is Shower of Blessings by Mipham, or something similar. 

The long Dudjom Tersar Ngondro states that it itself is enough, and that there is no need to do other creation or completion stage practices. Taking this as a basis, then one is given teachings on the three spaces and the text on rushan, and thogal. 

But since people's karma is different, there are many practices of the three roots for people of various dispositions and karmas.

We all experience moments of unfabricated consciousness at all times, but those moments are contaminated by cognitions. This is what is known in Dzogchen parlance as "unripened rigpa." 

Unless our experience is confirmed by an experienced teacher, we, on our own, have no way of validating whether what we think we are experiencing is conceptual blather or moments of unfabricated consciousness.

As far as other lineages go, I don't practice them and I cannot comment on people's experience.

My objection is to absurd neologisms, not to neologisms in general. No one knows what "ground-presencing" means since it is not English at all. "Presence" is a noun. There is no verb "to presence" in English. 

By contrast, a few simple Buddhist technical terms kept in Sanskrit (and a couple in Tibetan such as khregs chod and thod rgal) will keep translations much cleaner and neater.

We all experience "instant presence" all the time. The reason we have no confidence in this is that we have not been clearly introduced to it. When one is clearly introduced to it, the words do not matter very much. 

Rongzom Pandita stated that the words of Dzogchen are very simple, but their meaning is profound. It seems the hardest task in the world for Dzogchen translators to put these texts into simple language. Much of this is Herbert Guenther's fault. Thus we wind up with absurd neologisms like "ground-presencing" which mean absolutely nothing in English.

Actually, these definitions are quite clearly made in Tibetan texts. 

All that remains is for Westerners to stop conditioning Tibetan Lamas with mistranslations from their own naive misunderstandings of Dzogchen texts so that we can have good reliable translations of them based on native definitions of words. For example, with respect to the term dhātu, the actual Tibetan explanation is that a dhātu (dbyings) is a 'byung gnas," a source, hearkening back to the original Sanskrit meaning of dhātu as a "mine."

We must keep in mind that some of the most influential Dzogchen translations where made at a time when not only did the translators not understand Tibetan very well, let alone Dzogchen, but that the Tibetan Lamas involved knew almost no English. 

This is not to fault anyone, but merely to point out that Dzogchen translation is still in its infancy. But when one talks about translations, people get all mad because they invest a lot in what they thought they understood through translations they like.

He gives two glosses, depending on context. One is "instant presence." This is more in reference to the state discovered in direct introduction. 

The second is "knowledge of your primordial state [ye thog gzhi]." This is more global use of the term, when the term rigpa is used for the actual essence of Dzogchen. 

His translators just generally phoneticize the term as  rigpa these days, or use instant presence with rigpa in brackets. And his translators also understand that rang rig is not "self-knowing," but rather "one's knowledge."

They are all transitional, first attempts to translate a difficult subject by a difficult writer into English. Longchenpa' prose style is considered very elegant in Tibetan, but in English it has been generally rendered very turgidly so far. His verse translates into English somewhat more elegantly, but without considerable intellectual contrivance on the part of the translator, his verse, like most Tibetan verse, winds up being rendered very prosaically. 

But as with all first attempts, there can be errors, sometimes important ones, like the calque for dharmadhātu, "basic space of phenomena;" or the use of "ineffability" for nonexistence (med pa), which was the result of a translator/editorial team imposing a top down interpretation on a text, rather than reading the text itself, and more importantly, the tradition as a whole. Sometimes inertia just sets in, where people just follow what people before them did out of lack of certainty, clear research, or laziness. 

Some people want to translate everything into English, whereas I want to make some terms English, like dharmadhātu, dharmatā, etc. After all, no one translates the word "gaucamole" or "puttanesca" into English? They have become English words in their own right.

Madhyamaka is just a means of enforcing correct view. That's all.

It is strictly a critical approach for correcting other systems. It has no system of its own, but it does enforce rationality by subjecting propositions to the test of whether or not they have hidden statements of essences within them. Why? Because assertions of essence are irrational.

Among all these, Nāgārjuna accepts that latter is reasonable. He then goes on to deconstruct karma from an ultimate point of view, having already settled on the best conventional theory available to him.

There is Gyurme Dorje's, but it suffers from the same issue. Awareness is an inadequate, unattested, unjustified rendering for rig pa. I am afraid we are stuck with it until enough people have studied enough primary commentaries so the tides shift in a better direction.

It is really quite simple. This translation, one of the earliest made of a Dzogchen introduction text, was made in 1985, 32 years ago. Both teachers with whom Reynolds consulted were not fluent in English at the time this translation was made. We have made considerable progress in Dzogchen studies since that time. This should not be construed as a criticism of Reynolds, he did his best with limited resources. 

The use of "awareness" for rig pa in Dzogchen translations has become a chronic issue, one that causes a great deal of misunderstanding, and one it seems few translators have the courage to face. There are really no good words in English which capture the full semantic range of the term rig pa as it is used in Dzogchen, just as "avocado sauce" does not really capture the meaning of the term "guacamole" (from Nahuatl ahuacamolli, from ahuacatl ‘avocado’ + molli ‘sauce.'). Given this, it is as useful to translate rig pa as "awareness" as it would be to translate rig pa as "guacamole."

The passage is:

E ma

'di ka lta ba kun gyi yang rtse yin/

Amazing!
This clear, insubstantial knowledge (rig pa)
alone is the absolute pinnacle of all views.

The term "intrinsic" (rang) occurs nowhere in the passage. 

In case anyone continues to harbor doubt that rig pa should be understood as knowledge, Longchenpa clearly states in the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:

The definition of rig pa: the knowledge (rig pa) gained through the guru’s instructions which was formerly unknown (ma rig pa) is rig pa.

BTW, if something is not different from something, that makes it intrinsic. For example, water is intrinsically wet.

If you have been around the block, Ray's contribution is not "great;" anyone who teaches anything to do with Vajrayāna must by definition frame these things with reference to the body. For example, in the very first teaching on Vajrayāna I ever received from HHST, he made it very clear that the main difference between Vajrayāna and other forms of Buddhism was our emphasis on methods connected with the body which are wholly absent in sūtra. This is why we have yantra yoga, prāṇāyama, and so on in Vajrayāna. 

Then I mentioned that in common Mahāyāna etc., there is mindfulness of the body.

The reality is that since the body culture of India and Tibet was only come to us in fragments and dribs and drabs, quite often people overlook the vast literature on physical cultural, health, and illness that exists in these traditions, or because of biomedical prejudice, ignore it.

Tathatāgatagarbha is just a name for dharmakāya covered with afflictions. As such, it refers to the nature of the mind, that's all. It's doctrine was formulated as a reaction to the idea that the ultimate nature of sentient beings, beings with consciousness, is a blank emptiness. Hence, these sūtras and their commentary, the Uttaratantra, while acknowledging the essence of the mind is emptiness free from all extremes of proliferation, emphasize that the nature of the mind is an unconditioned clarity, just as for example, fire is not merely heat, but also light, for example, water is not just wet, it is also limpid. 

Also, the Nirvana Sūtra and so on explicitly reject the atman of non-buddhists.

He does indeed say what he means by Advaita. He is a student of Poonja-ji, like Andrew Cohen, Ganga-ji, Mooji and so on. Thus, we have a very clear idea of what Advaita means for him. 

He also paints a very clear picture of what Dzogchen means for him. This is one of the reasons why I characterized his description of Dzogchen as Vipassana gussied up in Tibetan drag. 

He describes his religious career very precisely: He first practiced Burmese-style Vipassana; he then went on to study with Poonja-ji, and then he spent a few years (5) taking teachings from Tulku Urgyen.

His book is entitled, "Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion." In this book he describes his view of religion in general, and Advaita and Dzogchen very thoroghly. 

Now, as for myself, I really do not have anything more to offer on the subject of this book, other than that as a "purist," someone who has devoted to the past 25 years of my life to studying and practicing Dzogchen, I do not think these sorts of popularizations of the teachings do anything more than confuse people. People are very influenced by the first book they read on a given subject, and it pains me to think that the first book someone might read on the subject of Dzogchen teachings is Harris's book.

No, these days EPK leaves it untranslated because apart from a few holdouts, everyone agrees "awareness" is not the right word for "rig pa."


The problems with translations of terms is that the field shifts more rapidly than we can reedit earlier work to reflect advances in our knowledge. Like deprecated or legacy code which has a large install base and is hard to upgrade, deprecated translations have a very long half-life, and people resist upgrading their terms. But the reason why deprecated code is deprecated is that it causes errors in computation. Likewise, legacy translations can cause errors in understanding. For example, many times you see texts translating rlung as prāṇa, when in fact rlung is a translation of vāyu. Prāṇa is properly translated into Tibetan as srog, life, and prāṇavāyu is translated as srog 'dzin rlung, lit., "the wind that sustains life." But over and over again we see people using the term prāṇa to refer to the five vāyus. This inaccuracy is a holdover from the introduction of Yoga to the West, from which these terms were first introduced.

Thus, students also have to keep up with the times, and when there is a major shift in how this or that term is understood, they have to shift with it. 

When it comes to clarity, however, clarity in Dzogchen is not a cognitive faculty. A commentary on the Blazing Lamp Tantra clarifies perfectly that the clarity discussed in Dzogchen is not the the clarity found in the three realms, but is rather clarity (gsal ba) in Dzogchen means zang thal, pellucidity, or 'od gsal ba, luminosity.

Finally, the point is not to make one person right and another person wrong. This is like science. When the facts change, we change accordingly.

The mind essence is unconditioned, empty clarity. The mind is conditioned. A person who has directly perceived their own mind essence is someone who has rig pa, knowledge. 

The mind essence is not cognizant, however, any more than a mirror is cognizant of the reflections on its surface.  

For example, to use a metaphor Norbu Rinpoche frequently employs for making people understand clarity, when you look at a vista and swiftly move your head from one side to the other, all of the impressions on your sense organ of the eyes (in this example) are part of your clarity, but one has no awareness or cognizance of any object within that field. If you recognize something in that field and pick it out, that is mind, not clarity. 

"Cognizant" (meaning to know of or be aware of something, ) means that one must have something to be cognizant of. It's built into the way the word is used in our language. You never use the verb without "of" being appended to it.

But the fact that he continues to state that the point of Dzogchen is the same as Advaita (nondual consciousness) to me shows that he misunderstood the intent of Dzogchen teachings.

Dzogchen is only for people who are truly interested in it. Others should find paths more suited to their wishes, As Pagor Vairocana said to Paṇḍita Prajn̄āsiddhi, when asked with which vehicle can the result be attained, he replied:

The individual entrances into the innermost view of ultimate dharmatā
are differentiated by grades of capacity. 
The result will also be obtained by realizing
any vehicle of the sublime Dharma taught by the Buddha.

Yogācāra already offers insights into the nonduality of consciousness. Indeed, that is the point of the whole school. 

Since Dzogchen rejects Yogācāra insights ( i.e. a Buddhist nondual realism) concerning the nonduality of consciousness, why would it accept Advaita (i.e. a non-Buddhist nondual eternalism) presentations concerning the nonduality of consciousness?  Dzogchen texts and teachings take explicit pains to differentiate themselves from non-Buddhist schools such as Saṃkhya, Vedanta and so on, as well as Yogācāra and so on. Mañjuśrīmitra takes pains to explain why Dzogchen and Yogācāra are not commensurate views. So does Rongzom, so does Longchenpa, etc.

More importantly, he makes a gross error in asserting that Dzogchen and Advaita seeks to provoke the same insight. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I also expect you will now withdraw your claim, "He explicitly and repeatedly does NOT equate advaita with dzogchen," because he repeatedly and explicitly does.

There is a very great misunderstanding that has arisen around the so called "transmission days." Originally they were anniversaries where the DC would gather every where in the world at the same time to do a practice related to that days anniversary. 

Then, sometime in the late 90's, ChNN came up with the idea of doing remote transmissions guided by video tape. This was soon replaced by webcast transmissions. 

But if you have not at least listened to ChNN intro to Dzogchen talks and so on, it is unlikely you will be properly prepared to receive transmission. So many people attend these webcast transmissions, but not understanding the real principle, they remain confused through no fault of their own.

Such a state does not indicate awakening. For example, in the Yoga Sūgtras, there is what they call "Kaivalya." A person who has attained kaivalya might appear much as you describe Ramana to be. Certainly my yoga guru discussed this in these terms: when you achieve liberation through Yoga, for you there will be nothing to do, just sit in your apartment,  breath, eat, shit, until you die, absorbed in purusha. 

But what distinguishes such a person? How does one know they are awakened, as opposed to resting in a mundane samadhi? 

If your notion of liberation is divorced from putting an end to samsaric rebirth, how is it even relevant at all to Buddha's teachings? And if it is not relevant to Buddha's teachings, why waste your time here?

Smṛti and saṃprajāna always accompany one another. If you are being mindful, you are being aware. If you are being aware, you are being mindful.

If you are a student of ChNN, you have three main jobs: 

1) Guru Yoga as a means of finding and then sustaining knowledge of your own state (rig pa). 
2) Being present and aware, i.e. mindful and aware. 
3) Working with circumstances. 

That's it.

The view gained through empowerment/direct introduction is experiential. The views of sūtra are analytical (bracketing Chan/Zen here). 

In sutrayāna, it is important that one's view in equipoise and post-equipoise match. It is for this reason that Madhyamakas such as Candrakīrti assert one cannot attain the path of seeing via Yogācāra. This is because one's view in equipoise is a product of analysis. 

If one faithfully practices the methods of sadhana, however, the method itself familiarizes one with the experiential view gained in empowerment that corresponds with the correct view arrived at in sūtrayāna equipoise. Then, it does not matter whether you advocate Yogācāra or Madhyamaka, since both are within the general rubric of Mahāyāna and emphasize the two-fold emptiness. 

With respect to that, even if you hold very wrong views, such Advaita, Samkhya, and so on, theoretically cultivation of sadhana methods of the Buddha can help you overcome these views through the development of the two accumulations. But if for example, one still believes in purusha or brahmin as an ultimate self/principle, then you will not make much progress in your practice beyond accumulation merit for a better rebirth, as well as having made a solid connection with a Buddhist guru.

There is however one other slight problem with thinking you can hold Hindu views while practicing Buddhist Vajrayāna sadhana ——&nbsp;it is a breakage of samaya to abandon the view of emptiness free from extremes. So there is that as well.

No, because their fundamental confusion will interfere with the meaning of the view pointed out during empowerment. Of course, if through practicing they abandoned this confused idea well then, no problem.

It is not the same with respect to Yogacara and Madhyamaka. Both advocate emptiness as correct view.

This of course has a lot to do with a difference in perspective about empowerments from an Ati point of view and a Maha or Anuyoga point of view.

There is considerably more to it than that. It is not just a pretty rite with nice haunting melodies. When you are inviting guests with the kangling, all kinds of formless spirits come.

By definition there is no yidam practice without empowerment. Yi dam is a translation of samādāna.  Samādāna means to undertake a promise. One only receives a yi dam, a commitment, from a guru. 

One may, out of devotion, choose to engage in a cycle of offerings and praises to any buddha or bodhisattva, including reciting their mantras/dhāranis which are found in sūtra. But this does not make this practice a yi dam or samādāna practice.

The original purpose of Sang, as I understand it, is that one has made some error, one purifies this mistaken through fumigation with aromatic plants. The second ancient idea of Sang related to nomads was that one would make any newcomer who came to your camp through juniper smoke, etc., to decontaminate them. When doing Sang with Tibetans, this custom is still observed. Later Sang became merged with the Buddhist idea of making offerings to the four classes of guests, but this is not part of the original, pre-Buddhist custom. And of course, confessions are a very important part of the Sang rite; absent, for example in Chö.

You might wish to think about that the next time you offer unsolicited advice. 

A lot of unintended consequences can result from making offerings to worldly beings. For example, there can be unintended consequences from making Sang offerings, sometimes fatal ones. But everyone thinks Sang offering are great, and never question the wisdom of making them in this or that place. But when one looks a little deeper, one discovers many stories of people who have mistakenly upset demons in a given area through doing Sang, through doing Chö, through doing Serkyem, etc. When you go and piss off some nāga for making an offering at the wrong time, or with the wrong incense for example, the effects may not hit you, because nagas strike out at random when they are annoyed —&nbsp;this is just one example.

The basis is ka dag, i.e., emptiness. It does not make sense to say that emptiness is one thing or many things. However, the emptiness of all things is the same; and yet it makes no sense to speak of emptinesses that are not the emptinesses of specific things. This is why we call the basis, "the generic basis." This basis, though nondual since existence, nonexistence, and so on do not apply to it, is also neither one thing nor many things. If it was one thing, it cannot manifest as a diversity; if it is many things, its single nature is contradicted. The Cuckoo of Vidyā states:

The primal nature of diversity is also nondual; 
in reality, free from the proliferation of partiality.

Śrī Heruka is an early form of Hevajra, and was Padmasambhava's main practice. 

The Laghusamvara indeed is a later tantra, appearing long after the Guhyasamaja and so on were translated during the first promulgation of tantras to Tibet. What makes it more valid than a whole host of earlier tantras in the Nyingma corpus, for example, the Guhyagarbha? This text definitely was translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan during the early ninth century. Did it ever occur to you that the circles in which tantras like Guhyagarbha. Vajrakilaya and so on were necessarily smaller since Vajrayāna was still an extremely new movement in India? Indians were just like Tibetans, going after newer revelations, and neglecting older ones. In fact, Indian panditas who came to Tibet in the 11th were unable to read the palm leave manuscripts from the late 8th/earlhy 9th century at Samye because in that 200 year period, scripts had changed so much. Dzogchen was a teaching which existed at Nalanda during the eighth century. We know this because there are several Indian commentaries on that tantra, we have mentions of a commentary for the rdo rje sems dpa' nam kha' che by Śrī Singha quoted bu Nubchen. Why do we accept the Chan masters he quotes as being real people and real texts, but throw shade on the Dzogchen texts and masters he mentions? It is shitty scholarship to do so.

1) What do you mean by Shamanic?
2) How is Yungdrung Bon shamanic at all?  
3) How is Nyingma related to Yungdrung Bon, what specific practices do you mean? You cannot possibly mean Dzogchen because Dzogchen's roots in "India" are very clear and well established.

As far as I can tell, you are just repeating old orientalist tropes from the early 20th century.

Buddhism had the custom of offering incense, part of the standard set of offerings we find in Indian religion. That's it. But it was nothing like a purifying Sang offering, or Native American rites using sage and other aromatic plants for purification. Such smoke offerings are absent from all Buddhisms apart from Himalayan Buddhism.

I also think it is not useful to say that these things are "shamanic," the term is to vague and ill-defined.

It was, ChNN, building on Samten Karmey's research, points out that a specific custom we find in pre-Buddhist Tibetan rites is that they always detail the history and purpose of the rite as a prolegomena, and that recitation is integral to the rite itself. This distinguishes autochthonic Tibetan rites from Indian imports. 

I would argue that this custom has carried over into Tibetan Buddhism as a concern for lineage and origin narratives, a concern largely absent from Indian Buddhism in general.

No, this is a conceit of these schools, and at one time I believed this, but in reality, in their own way, the practice of Vajrayāna in Gelug and Sakya is as far removed from Indian modes of practice as it is in Nyingma. The Gelugpas and Sakyas also make use of thread cross rituals, sang offerings, elaborate tormas, Drala rites, and so on.

The problem with this conversation is that the term "Shamanism" is too vague and imprecise. We have a pretty precise idea of what Buddhism is, in all its aspects, and we know quite well its flexibility in accommodating local cults. But we do not have a very precise idea of what the blanket term "Shamanism" entails.

Of course, you are wholly ignoring the fact that the whole passage is predicated on defining knowledge (rig pa) with respect to its opposite, ignorance (ma rig pa).


For example, Mipham warns about fabricated knowledge that arises from analysis:


Making effort for a long time in growing the huge poisonous tree of the appearance of clinging to union that is fertilized with the empty clarity of a fabricated vidyā that analyzes each extreme is a ground of deviation in the luminous Great Perfection.

No, it implies that the state of the teacher and student are the same state as in all water is wet, all fires are hot. There is no separation in "all water is wet, all fires are hot," where "all" refers to all instances of wetness or heat. When one takes things as a group, a group is by nature not individuated. 

Dzogchen does not abandon the firmly established nominalism which permeates general Buddhist discourse, and Buddhist logic in particular—&nbsp; in fact it reinforces it.

If I understand your question: you are asking if rig pa is the substance of consciousness? I have already provided an authoritative citation from a commentary on a primary tantra which answers this question:


Furthermore, based on the power of repelling the armies of samsara, vidyā (rig pa) is 1) the knowledge (vidyā) of names designated by words, 2) helpful, worldly knowledge such as healing, arts and crafts, and so on, 3) the five sciences (rig pa gnas lnga) of the treatises and so on, 4) knowing (vidyā) as a factor of consciousness, 5) sharp and dull worldly knowledge and so on, and 6) the knowledge of the essence (snying po) that permeates all that is free from ignorance, unobscured by the obscurations of ignorance and so on.

No, rig pa is a kind of knowledge. All sentient beings are born with consciousness, and aspect of consciousness is the ability to know things. Sentient beings are not born with rig pa. Rig pa is something one learns from a teacher experientially.  Before one has rig pa, one has ma rig pa. This applies even to Samantabhadra, the adibuddha.

There are three transmissions in Dzogchen, mind, symbol, and verbal. The teacher explains things verbally using symbols, and if the student can be in that state with the teacher at the same time, this is the mind transmission. 

Direct introduction is different. With direct introduction the teacher uses experiences to show the student the nature of their mind. There are introductions through ka dag and lhun drub. They are different, but bear on the same point. 

At this point, since what you really want to discuss is comparisons between Dzogchen and Zen, I suggest that you open a separate thread since this is kind off topic in a thread devoted to Sam Harris.

There is certainly a similarity, but again, in the Broughton book, this is not a direct introduction, this is more like someone hearing about the Perfection of Wisdom teachings and activating traces of having practiced Mahāyāna in a past life. It is also true that one will never even hear the word "Dzogchen" in this life without some past life connection with the teaching. Apart from these topographical similarities, however, I see no reason to assume that step 1 of Zongmi is identical in content to what we call direct introduction in Dzogchen without futher concrete evidence in how Chan/Zen is transmitted in the present day. 

In brief, Both Chan and Dzogchen maintain they are "outside the scriptures." But this too is merely a topographical similarity. In the case of the former, it is outside sūtras, but depends on sūtras for its context. In the case of the latter, it is outside tantras, but depends on tantras for its context. So when we say that Chan is a sūtra teaching, it means that it is part of the Perfection Vehicle and all of its rhetoric turns on themes found in Mahāyāna sūtras. When we say that Dzogchen is a secret mantra teaching, it means it is part of secret mantra and all of its rhetoric turns on themes found in outer and inner tantras, with less attention paid to the three vehicles of characteristics. 

There exists only one sustained discussion of the similarities and differences between Chan and Dzogchen in one text written by the Tibetan master, Nubchen Sanggye Yeshe, which is also one of our earliest sources for Dzogchen prior to the 10th century in Tibet. There is an interesting little book published recently by Van Schaik called Tibetan Zen: Discovering a Lost Tradition which will certainly add the conversation. However, the main point I am making is that Tibetans familiar with Chan grouped it in with the sūtrayāna while at the same time respecting that Chan termed itself a sudden path and a teaching nominally outside of the sūtras since it depended on experience rather than intellectual analysis. Dzogchen is also a path which depends on experience rather than intellectual analysis (but in fact the same may be said of all classes of tantra), but the contexts of the two teachings are really different because of the milieus in which each arose. 

Whether a translation of Nubchen's text will prove interesting to Chan/Zen people is doubtful, because apparently the Chan in that text represents the long dead Northern School, and not a living tradition of Chan.

Well, simply put, the buddhahood realized in Vajrayāna is deeper than the buddhahood realized in Mahāyāna because the means are different. 

Mahāyāna only leads to the eleventh bhumi. Vajrayāna in general leads to the 13th bhumi, Vajradhara. What is the difference? According to the Saṃputa Tantra, buddhas of the eleventh and twelfth bhumis do not recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own pristine consciousness. This realization is confined to buddhas of the thirteenth bhumi. Of course, whether someone accepts this or not depends very much on whether one accepts the Saṃputa Tantra, a general commentary tantra on the mother tantras, as being valid. Why is there this difference? Because the paths or means are different.

He does talk about mahamudra in this book. On page 33, he offers a useful distinction. 

On page 67 he says, "When seeing the three qualities simultaneously, this is called seeing the nature of the mind. In Dzogchen, this is called rigpa, or you can call it the Dzogchen view."

Very clearly, he describes seeing the nature of the mind as rigpa. And I agree with this completely. Again, on 68, "When the clapper strikes the bell, it is like a moment of seeing the nature of the mind. That is rigpa."

When I read this book, I understand him to say that seeing the nature of the mind is rigpa. Therefore, I do not see a real difference between the essentials of what he is saying and what I am saying.

Yes, I addressed this point earlier. It is well known that in Gampopa's mahāmudra the paths and stages are regarded as little more than distractions, and not important. That still does not make the four yogas any less sequential. The error is asserting that the mapping of them to the paths and stages was definitive or even necessary. This is what freaked out the Sakyas ——&nbsp;"irresponsible" Kagyu yogis telling them they didn't need no stinkin paths or stages.

According to Gyalwa Yangonpa, the four yogas are for those who, in his words, cannot be in this state:

 It is not soiled by experience and sensations, it is not corrupted by realization and certainty, it is not divided by view, meditation and conduct, it is not sectioned into a basis, path and result, all of these phenomena of appearance and existence, samsara and nirvana are neither removed nor added, bound nor freed, nor fixed with an antidote. Recognition of and self-liberation into one’s own state is called “mahāmudra.”

It is for people who do not experience buddhahood through intimate instructions; with respect to that, the four yogas are like thögal in Dzogchen.
