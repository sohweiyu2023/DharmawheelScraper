Then, you should accumulate merit by practicing Ngondro. Your inability to receive higher teachings means one of two things: you do not have a karmic cause and condition to meet the teachers you want to meet; or two, you have not accumulated enough merit to meet them.

Since there is never a time when we did not have the innate grasping of our continuum as a self, it has always been distinct, since there is no beginning of consciousness or anything else. The logic of dependent origination forbids any sort of first cause or prime mover-- all causes are effects, and all effects are causes in their turn. Our consciousnesses are distinct because we apprehend them as a self and what belongs to a self. But the more practical point is this-- my karma is my karma and ripens on me alone, even after I attain realization and until buddhahood is attained. One cannot speak of what happens to a buddha's mind after the breakup of their aggregates, since this is one of the 14 questions to which the Buddha refused to respond. When I taste a lemon, there is no taste of sour in your mouth. This is because our psycho-physical continuums are distinct, with distinct physical and mental sense organs, etc. Even when the aggregates break up at death, because of the innate grasping to self, the mind immediately appropriates a new series of aggregates. This is why the aggregates are referred to in Sanskrit as upādāna-skandhas, addictive aggregates—we appropriate them because we are addicted to the three afflictions, driven by the obscuration of knowledge that is the innate grasping to I, me, and mine. Even tenth stage bodhisattvas, while they are not subject to birth in the three realms, still have the knowledge obscuration, the most subtle grasping to "I, me, mine."

For the most part, there is no meaningful difference between bulk of teachings of Tibetan Buddhist schools. They are all Mulasarvāstivādin from the point of view of ordination; from the point of view of path, they are all Mahāyāna; and they all claim to be Prasanga Madhyamaka in intellectual orientation—though Karma Kagyu and Jonang might considered outliers, they still claim they adhere to Madhyamaka. 

The principle difference between Tibetan schools is what Vajrayāna traditions they adhere too. But even this is misleading, since Sakya, Kagyu and Jonang, largely base their teachings on the late Nalanda tradition and the Vajrayāna practitioners who associated with this university, such as Naropa, Ratnakarashanti, etc. While Nyingmapas follow earlier Vajrayāna traditions, they too are based on Nalanda Buddhism. Geluk is based principally on the Sakya and the (now defunct) Kadampa schools. 

Thus, in terms of the  vast majority of teachings, the four or five schools of Tibetan Buddhism are much more similar than they are different. 

The academic curriculum of Modern Tibetan Buddhism is based on Mulasarvāstivādin Vinaya, Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras, Madhyamaka, and some study of Yogacāra. However, the dominant influence in Tibetan Buddhism is Nāgārjuna, and anything that does not comport with Nāgārjuna is considered wrong or inferior view. 

In short, trying to tell a Tibetan Buddhist they do not belong to the Madhyamaka school is like trying to tell Chan and Zen Buddhists they do not follow Bodhidharma. You are not going to get very far with that claim.

Ummm....no. Your rebuttal is way, way, off the mark. First of all, your objection confuses the position concerning the cessation that the highest tenet system of Hinayana holds, vs. our own personal understandings of these issues in a Mahayana context. 

Second my remarks never addressed nirvana with remainder, but were strictly confined to what nirvana without remainder meant, and I referenced a Sutta in the Sutta Nipata which directly addresses the issue of what one may say about an arhat whose aggregates have broken up—nothing at all is the answer—and why.

The issue of what Buddhas and arhats experience while they are alive, according to shravakas,  is an entirely separate topic.

From a Mahayana point of view, nonarising and unceasing have a completely different meaning than they do from a Hinayana point of view.

Content:
1) It is very clear the Sautrāntikas do not accept the Abhidharma treatises of the Sarvāstivādins to be word of the Buddha. If they did, there would be no basis for dispute.  This does not however prevent them from accepting that the Buddha taught a subject called "abhidharma," scattered throughout the Agamas. 

2) The Sarvāstivādins are forced, in the Mahāvibhāṣā, to reconcile the composition of the treatises of Abhidharma by arhats, with the claim that they are also the word of the Buddha. On pg. 19, the Vibhāṣā is quoted, "If this is the case, why does the tradition attribute the writing down of this treatise [the Jñānaprasthāna] to the Āryan Kātyāniputra?" After claiming that the this treatises was indeed the word of the Buddha, the respondent also admits that according to another opinion, the Jñānaprasthāna is just the work of the Āryan Kātyāniputra. Thus, our Vaibhāṣika author attempts to conclude that while the Abhidharma is the word of the Buddha, it is also the work of Āryan Kātyāniputra. 

But if we accept this to be case, this is very problematical, because of the number of places in the treatise where Vasubandhu refutes theories which, according to your view, would be theories originally enunciated by the Buddha, thus leaving open the claim that Vasubandhu was rejecting the Dharma. 

Further, on pg. 36, Poussin lays out the position of the Sautrāntikas in eleven points of difference, the first of which is the rejection of the authority of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma. 

The notion that the Buddha taught Abdhidharma to the devas in the desire realm is a Pali tradition connected with the Abhidhamma Pitika, and has no corresponding analogue in Indian Buddhism. 

Now, generally speaking, the Sautrāntikas are held to be the higher tenet system, and therefor, in Mahāyāna we also do not accept the authority of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma. Further, Mahāyāna has its own Abhidharma, in the form of the now lost Abhidharma Sūtra.

There are two kinds of pratimokṣa vows: śrāvaka and Mahāyāna. One need not take the former to take the latter. 

For example, supposing you have never before taken refuge and you go to an empowerment from an upāsaka guru such as HH Sakya Trichen. During the empowerment you will receive pratimokṣa vows (as well as bodhisattva vows and vajrayāna samayas of all four classes of tantra), but not śrāvaka pratimokṣa vows, you will instead receive Mahayāna pratimokṣa vows. One can only receive śrāvaka pratimokṣa vows from a bhikṣu, and never an upāsaka.

No. 

Mahāyāna vows and practice do not require srāvaka vows and practice as a precursor. Among the three vows, Mahāyāna has its own pratimokṣa, so there is no prima facie need to take srāvaka pratimokṣa beforehand. 

Mahāyāna is a independent vehicle, and does not require śravakayāna as a foundation.

Not annihilation, absolute cessation of the continuum of the aggregates. What else could it be, if there is nothing else apart from the aggregates upon which an a self is imputed. 

Peter Harvey, in Selfless Persons, argues that an unconditioned consciousness continues, but he is not a classical shravaka, and does not cite classical shravakas sources which confirm his ideas. He bases his argument, as far as I recall, On some very elusive passages in the Pali suttas. But the sautrantikas still argue that nirvana is unreal, whether you like it or not. Not only this, but everyone who has ever written a book on the subject of the four tenet systems in India and Tibet also confirms this fact.

Even the Sarvastivada acknowledge that that their seven treatises of Abhidharma were not directly taught by the Buddha. And the sautrantikas base their critiques in sutra, rejecting abhidharma metaphysics where they contradict sutra, which is why, in the scheme of the four tenet systems, the latter are considered higher than the former. This is apropos, because you invoked sutra in defense of your claim that shravakas do not seek a kind of total cessation.

The truth of the matter is that there has not been an official position established by the College of Kagyu Cardinals at a theological convention. Anyone in any school is free to accept any variant of Madhyamaka they prefer. The fact that people decide to follow an "canonical" opinion is merely indicative that they are playing team sports and cannot be considered a serious scholar. 

Karl B., is a serious scholar, but he is also playing team sports, since even he admits that the way gzhan stong pas use Yyogacāra material is not consistent with the way the founders (Maitrya, Asanga, Vasybandhu) of yogacāra use it. There is a place for both, but most of Buddhists are not serious scholars, and only play team sports for the views promulgated as official in their school. This is why I personally abandoned paying too much mind to what Tibetans had to say about madhyamaka, and exclusively rely on what can be discerned in the authentic treatises of the founders of these two systems, madhyamaka and yogacāra, and free of the largely Tibetan historical interpretation of Buddhist doctrine through the lens of the three turnings, a lens entirely neglected by Indian masters.

What is the difference between this and yogacāra? 

This won't work with Dzogchen by the way, where a hard distinction is made between snang ba (appearances), subjective experience, and snang yul, objective appearance (apparent objects). The former are understood to be coterminous with the mind and indistinguishable from it; the latter are understood to be different from the mind, and distinguishable from it.

You seem to be using “experience” in place of “direct perception”. But this is an error, experiences are second order cognitions. For example, the meditative signs such as smoke and so on, are called experiences because you interpret such experiences as products of equipoise, unlike the experience of seeing smoke on a hill. For example, a taste of sweet is not an experience of sweet until it is categorized as such. Example, if you first place a bit of an herb called gymnena on your tongue, it blocks the sense receptors for tasting sweet, so even you place sugar on the tongue, you will not experience a sweet taste.

In the system of yogacāra, there are seven cognizing consciousnesses: the five physical sense consciousnesses; mental consciousness; and afflicted consciousness, which apprehends phenomena as "I or mine."

Not by an ordinary sentient being, only by a buddha. Why? Because the ālayavijñāna is neither an object of cognition nor a cognizing consciousness. 

Ālaya is actually just a name for ignorance, in the system of Dzogchen. And this is made extremely clear in all the commentaries that bear on the issue. 

But perhaps what you mean to refer to is the ālaya, aka the nature of the mind, which is the inseparable clarity and emptiness taught in the Kagyu and Sakyapa schools. If this is the case, while clarity of course can be recognized, this is not the ālaya being spoken of in Dzogchen teachings, which is the subject of this discussion. 

In this case, the ālaya and the dharmakāya can only be differentiated or distinguished by a person who attains complete and total buddhahood in this life, at the time they attain complete and total buddhahood. This is discussed somewhat extensively by Vimalamitra in his commentary on the Blazing Lamp Tantra.

Conscious in what sense? Is it a conscious event inherently? Is it a conscious event in absence of contact? In absence of an object? In absence of a mind? How can one even speak of appearances at all in the absence of subject/object bifurcation? It is elementary to understand there are a subject, object, and contact, given, as you admit above, there can be no experience in absence of that triad. Further, in the case of a dream, it is clear there is an absence of this triad. Therefore, with respect to dreams you have to account for the experience of them based on some other theory of cognition. Also, given that direct perceptions are nonconceptual by nature, even your invocation of “experience” is merely an inference, and thus it is in no better place than the inference of subject/object bifurcation, which is standard in Buddhist models of cognition, and in many ways, inferior to it.

Without receiving the empowerment, one cannot practice any deity yoga at all. 

Deities are just expressions of Abdhidharma concepts, in general. For example, the celestial mansion is understood to represent the thirty-seven bodhipakṣadharmas and so on. The purpose of deity yoga, the creation stage, is to counteract the ordinary concept of "I," "I am Malcolm," for example, with a transcendent concept of oneself, " I am Mañjuśṛī." And then you have a completion stage, to break attachment to even that sense of identity, in which nonconceptual samadhis are rapidly generated with a combination of prāṇāyāmas and postural yogas, etc.

The whole point of these is purify the obscurations related to afflictions and obscurations related to knowledge, respectively, that is the creation stage deity yoga is the remedy for affliction; the completion stage is the remedy for knowledge obscurations. 

And yes, you need a guru, since you need empowerment, and yes, trying this on one's without guidance is always disastrous. One becomes a rudra.

This just reflects your upper middle class background. Working class people have always cussed and sworn. These mores came to the fore only when the new middle class Americans began to ape Victorian mores. Before that, there was a lot of cussing and swearing. 

Also, I just want to point out that the large majority of our more offensive swear words are normal Anglo-Saxon words that were in regular use in common language prior the Norman invasion, and only became deprecated due to systematic oppression of Anglo-Saxon language by the Normans. So, also, we can understand swearing as a social revolt against our "betters."

Adi is translated into Tibetan as "dang po," first. Thus adibuddha is dang po'i sangs rgyas, the first or original buddha.

The all-basis, (kun gzhi, ālaya), is just ignorance; it is the Dzogchen term for what in other systems is called "the knowledge obscuration."  This is why in the text called Stainless Space in the Lama Yang Tig, the mind, aka all-basis, is called "an obscuration to be abandoned."

It is distinct from the basis (gzhi, sthāna), which is never contaminated by ignorance.

All Tibetan Buddhist schools are ekayāna schools. It is standard Indian Mahāyāna. The discussion of three vehicles is from the point of view of bodhicitta of the aspirant-- the very real fact that there are people who prefer to become arhats, and eschew, for various reasons, entering the bodhisattva path with Mahāyāna bodhicitta. They prefer the inferior bodhicitta of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas for this and that reason.

The 52 stages are strictly Chinese Buddhist interpretation of the Avatamsaka Sūtra, which has five chapters describing the qualities of the ten bhumis; but in China, it was interpreted that these chapters (such as the ten dedications, etc.) were themselves distinct stages and levels of practice. This concept is complete absent in Indian Mahāyāna.

"He or she therefore studies the tantras and their commentaries."

The word in red is not "studies." It is "mnyan pa," to hear. In other words, one is encouraged to go and hear about the general meaning of "tantra" in order have confidence. For example, like the words of encouragement at the end of the Lam rim, etc., which encourages faith in Vajrayāna and briefly explains its superiority to common Mahāyāna, but it certainly does not mean studying tantras and commentaries without guidance. Moreover, it can be read that what is being encouraged here is to study with meaning of the word "tantra" itself. There is no mention of "rgyud rnams," tantras in plural, but rather "rgyud" alone. So, I think you've misunderstood this point. It is certainly fine to study what the word "tantra" means and have confidence in this vehicle. But it is passingly strange to encourage people to study tantras and commentaries, and contradicts what Kongtrul says about the need for secrecy in Buddhist Ethics (TOK, book 5, pp. 261): "(7) To disclose secrets to immature persons means to reveal the secrets of profound bliss...to someone who has not been ripened by initiation..." 

Now in fairness, Kongtrul assumes this means that one should not disclose Vajrayāna methods to people interested in practicing as a śrāvaka and so on. But other masters, such as Sakya Paṇḍita, have a very different idea. Sapan remarks that this seventh root downfall includes showing one's vajra and bell, etc. or performing ganacakras, etc. explaining secret mantra, etc. to anyone who does not possess empowerment.

I am still not sure about this. One reason is that to study the tantras and commentaries means a. One is literate, still rare in Tibet in 19th century; b. Has access to texts. C. Most unlikely, a literate person in in Tibet who has never ever received any empowerment. D. Each section of a major empowerment qualifies one to study different kinds of tantras, and not before. So this may indeed be JK’s position, but there is a lot of context missing here. So I still think it not sound advice, considering what the tantras themselves say about such matters.

Of course these days, everything is published and people are free, but they really should not be reading the Hevajra Tantra, the Guhyasamaja Tantra, the Cakrasamvara Tantra (!), etc., prior to having received empowerment.

It is not a question of convenient or inconvenient. They are distinct paths. 

Common Mahāyana is based on renunciate conduct and intellectual analysis. 

Uncommon Mahāyāna Secret Mantra is based on non-renunciate conduct and experience derived empowerment and practice. 

I am not claiming that one should cease to study sūtrayāna material. I am claiming however, that to deprive people of access to Vajrayāna methods is simply a gross misunderstanding. Why? Because Vajrayāna is self-sufficient method of realizing the paths and stages to buddhahood, and moreover,  it is a much more rapid path than any path sūtrayāna has to offer. My understanding of sūtra material is a result of practicing Vajrayāna, not the other way around. I did not begin to genuinely understand Madhyamaka and Abhidharma for example, until after I had been practicing sadhana practice for some years. But on the other hand, I was a highly motivated student. Not everyone is very highly motivated.

The aversion to analysis is different than aversion to concepts. Someone who has never received any kind of introduction must depend on analysis. But this person is also not practicing mahāmudra. The fundamental distinction between mahāmudra practice and sūtrayāna practice must be introduction at the time of empowerment, otherwise the word, mahāmudra, is quite meaningless.

Whether people are successful or not in a Vajrayāna retreat depends on them. If one recites mantras, etc. in a state of distraction, one will make little progress.

What are we supposed to do? Coddle people's misconceptions in hope that if we are sufficiently gentle they will somehow wake up from their misonconceptions.

New agers never give up bad ideas, but just keep piling more and more "esoteric" crap on top of the old "esoteric" crap, like sea birds filling an Island with guano. The only difference is that guano can be used as fertilizer, whereas nothing but mental weeds grow in New Age manure.

All teachings must be subject to rational analysis, as the Buddha said, one must examine teachings, including his,  in the same way a goldsmith evaluates the purity of gold: by weighing, cutting, and burning. 

BTW, "empirical recognition" means that such a teaching is evaluated through the consensus of people without special knowledge or special faculties, who verify this or that fact through rational analysis. I think perhaps you mean "direct perception," such as that involved in tasting sugar, which cannot be described to someone who has never tasted anything sweet. Saying "sugar is sweet" means nothing to such a person. 

However, even realization may be gauged through the kinds of experiences one has, which is why in Vajrayāna teachings, and even in sūtra, the criteria set out for what a realized person experiences is very carefully mapped in order that people who are practicing the path can distinguish between valid experience and delusion.

No, Dzogchen realization is not a "nondual awareness,"  since "awareness" is a mistranslation of the term vidyā/rig pa. Vidyā, in Dzogchen texts, refers to knowledge of one's essence (snying po, garbha). For example, the commentary of the Tantra Without Syllables, the main upadesha tantra of the view, states:

Vidyā (rig pa) is (1) the knowledge of names designated by words; (2) the five sciences (rig pa gnas lnga) such as helpful worldly knowledge like healing, arts and crafts, the treatises, and so on; (3) knowledge (rig pa) as a factor of consciousness, such as sharp and dull worldly knowledge and so on; and (4) the knowledge of the essence (snying po) that permeates all, which is free from ignorance (avidyā), unobscured by the obscurations of ignorance, and so on.

If you carefully read Longchenpa, you find out that in the view of Dzogchen, nonduality is a description of the state of all things that is free from any ontic extremes such as being, nonbeing, and so on. But it is certainly is not the state of Paramshiva described in Trika texts, which regard everything as an expression of Shiva, and thus existent and real. In Dzogchen, even Samantabhadra possessed ignorance at the time of the basis. 

When one carefully studies Dzogchen teachings under the direction of a qualified person, one discovers that the promiscuous overuse of the term "nondual" anything in Dzogchen is very misleading. I am not denying that the term "nondual" is used in Dzogchen, because of course it is, but it does not mean the same thing as the nondual state discussed in Advaita and Trika. It just isn't. The Dzogchen usage is grounded in Yogacara language, in this respect, and indeed it is the Yogacarins who prove that mindstreams are independent, unique, and differentiated, while at the same time denying external objects. 

On the other hand, Dzogchen does not deny external objects, which is why Longchenpa laughs at the idea that they do not exist, and provides an account in the Treasury of Citations about the relationship and difference  between outer objects (rol pa), bodhicitta ()byang chub sems) or the basis (gzhi), and the potential (rtsal) of bodhicitta, which of course is just one's personal state. If you study this carefully, you will understand that calling Dzogchen a nondual system similar to Advaita and Trika is really a huge error. You can understand that again and again, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu explains that the basis, the primordial state is personal, not universal.

The notion that Dzogchen and Trika are commensurate is a complete error. Dzogchen does not propose an absolute nonduality of any kind. If you think so, you are deeply mistaken and you need to study more, or better yet, study with a qualified teacher who can remove the cataract of your ignorance. 

And in general, since every mind stream arises based on its own unique set of causes and conditions, mind streams in Buddhadharma are considered individual, unique, and differentiated. There are reams of Mahāyāna arguments which prove this. These individual, unique, and differentiated do not possess any svabhāva, they are free from extremes, and therefore, the fault of attributing identity to them does not exist.

Actually, five: male, female, intersexed people (this is modern name for hermaphrodites); people with same sex orientation, and congenitally-sterile people. 

Most transgendered women would be considered eunuchs, from a classical Buddhist point of view. Since all of these gender definitions are defined because of criteria for entering the Sangha, women are left out of it, hence included in same sex orientation in general. However, we could consider transgendered men eunuchs as well. The other two kinds of paṇḍakas, voyeurs and people who are only sexual active with the phases of the moon are not in consideration here.

They are all paṇḍakas, and all for the same set of reasons. One cannot perform a procreative physical act with a person of the same gender. It is also unkind to subject these people to moral judgements. A transgendered person is someone who was born that way, even if they need to have reassignment surgery. This is why the Dharma recognizes that there are more than two genders. Modern society should catch up.

If you have received any Vajrayāna empowerment, you are required by samaya to take sense pleasures for your own enjoyment. 

However, I was making a little joke. Epicurus, the founder of Hedonism, is the founder of the doctrine at the heart of so-called Deism, a cover term for atheist, among educated Anglo-Americans during the revolutionary period. 

It is the secularism at the heart of Hedonism which I was invoking. And after all, there is nothing wrong with living for pleasure, mundane or transcendent. It is better than asceticism.

Gnas pa is not really equivalent with formal śamatha. In other words, you do not have to have perfect śamatha of the type described in lower teachings. Gnas pa really just means being without concepts, or mental movements, for a little while. Then you discover that. You also discover that you cannot stop the movements of concepts. That is mi g.yo, "not moving." Then you disover they are the same state, mnyam nyid. Then having discovered that sameness, then you can effortlessly be in your real nature, lhun grub. 

In order to create understanding in others, we equate the first two samadhis with śamatha and vipaśyanā, but it is a very gross and inaccurate comparison.

In general, from the perspective of Dzogchen teachings, there are two kinds of persons: people who are inclined towards perceptual objects, and people who are inclined towards the self-appearance of vidyā. Teachings like semzins, tummo, chulen, etc., are oriented towards the former, and trekcho and thogal are oriented towards the latter. 

In the section I mentioned, the progression is recognition, trust, and decisiveness. The Sound Tantra relates:

The recognition of one's own state is encountered with trust, 
Decisiveness establishes one in confidence.

This is just a very concise summary of the basic principles of Dzogchen teachings that are reinforced by the Three Phrases and so on. 

These days, practicing śamatha accompanied with Dzogchen view is sometimes referred to as trekcho, but it is not really trekcho. Trekcho cannot arise out of śamatha. As The Tantra Without Syllables states:

Though the nature of vidyā pervades all,
the dharmakāya is encountered in the intimate instructions.

While it is certainly the case that practicing śamatha or mantra recitation (they are equivalent) with a Dzogchen view is beneficial, it is not the actual path of Dzogchen.

He has said this.

It’s not possible for anyone to differentiate the alaya from the dharmakaya, or cut through the alaya, etc.,  unless they realize the exhaustion of dharmata in this lifetime. The alaya is the knowledge obscuration. It’s the last thing that goes before buddhahood fully dawns in ones mind. 

The classical definition of trekchod is someone attaining full awakening upon introduction. Trekcho is related to the basis, the view. It is wisdom, shes rab. This is why they say trekcho is for lazy, intelligent people who don’t like to meditate.

In dzogchen teachings one is using many different methods to discover natural concentration. Discovering shamatha is relatively simple when you use the approaches taught in the dzogchen tantras, rather than relying on the gradual method introduced by Kamalshila. 

Rigpa is knowledge of your own state, when you have it, you never lose it, even if you are distracted. 

One point where I really disagree with Wallace is his idea that trekcho is Dzogchen shamatha. I really dispute this notion.

I think the myths and legends found in Buddhism and Bon are important. They lend a sense of place and tradition. But when it comes to making truth claims on the basis of these myths and legends, this is where the trouble begins. For example, Virupa lived in the late 9th century. It is claimed he stopped the sun for three days while he and his two companions were on a drinking spree. You'd think that such a major astronomical event would be recorded somewhere in the world...but it isn't. Ergo, legend.

But when we find evidence in Indian treatises refuting Śṛī Simha by name, we have to conclude  Śṛī Simha was at the head of a genuine movement within Indian Buddhism in the mid-8th century called in Tibet, "rdzogs chen," and that whether one wants to accept the traditional accounts as facts or not, no one can deny the existence of Śṛī Simha nor can they deny he was the teacher of Vairocana. One can certainly debate what Dzogchen might have constituted at this early period, but we cannot deny that what took shape in Tibet as "rdzogs chen" is grounded in Indian Vajrayāna of the mid-8th century.  The contemporary record of Bonpo documents from the same period (eighth century) however, do not reveal any teachings even remotely resembling Buddhism, let alone rdzogs chen. The conclusion most students of history will then draw is that the Bonpos borrowed and adapted much Buddhist material to their own set of  cultural narratives, much as Taoists in China borrowed and adapted much Buddhism to their own cultural narratives. 

This does not mean that Buddhists did not borrow Bonpo innovations in Dzogchen. As I point out in the intro to my forth-coming translation of the Blazing Lamp Tantra and its commentary, the scheme of six lamps is utterly absent from any Nyingma tantras in the Nyingma rgyud 'bum (for example, the term dkar 'jam rtsa is absent, etc.). On the Buddhist side of things, the six lamps seem first to appear in Longchenpa's Lama Yang thig and Zab mo yang thig in a set of texts called snyan brgyud. Since we know that there was interaction between Buddhists and Bonpos, especially between Nyingmapas and Bonpos, and since we know that Zhang Zhung Snyan Brgyud was written down after the seventeen tantras were revealed, but before Longchenpa, and given that the six lamps form a major part of that ZZNG textual cycle, the appearance of a similar list (though not precisely identical in all details) in Longchenpa's oeuvre bearing the title "snyan brgyud" leads one to speculate that Buddhists borrowed the scheme of six lamps from ZZNG and modified it to suit themselves. However, it is notable that in the Seven Treasures, there is no presentation at all of six lamps, only four. At present, the schemes of four and six lamps are very standard in various Buddhist Dzogchen curriculums. The scheme of six lamps earned its Buddhist canonicity from Longchenpa and also from the 15th century Zhitro cycle of Karma Lingpa.

What I can say is that one argument that could be made is that when practicing the visions, during the second vision one begins to develop clairvoyance, such as past lives and so on, and so the obvious rejoinder to anything I have put forward is to claim special knowledge based on yogic vision, similar to the Buddha's statements about past Buddhas and so on in his past lives.

Yes, this is his idea. I don't really share his opinion. When you compare them to say Vairocana's translations of the five early lungs -- the former betray a smoothness of composition that one really does not find in orally transmitted texts. That said, they are excellent little verses, and their commentary is even more interesting. 

Regardless of origin, I think that many Bon teachings are valid Buddhadharma, even if I do not buy their historical narrative, but then, I don't necessarilyu buy all Buddhist historical narrative, like the Kālacakra dates for Buddha's lifetime. The study of Bon literature is absolutely vital to understanding Tibetan culture. There are so many useful and interesting things that Bon texts have to share. 

I am sympathetic with their story, and am happy to admit they have long suffered oppression in the hands of Buddhists. 

But if you ask me to just blindly accept their historical claims...can't do it.

I am aware that ChNN made this observation, I studied with Precious Vase with him directly, so I know exactly what he said about it. He said the twelve minor tantras do not constitute a path, and that everything in Bon Dzogchen that could be construed as a path was borrowed from Buddhism.

He used ZZNG as an example of aural lineages, where the teachings were preserved in kernal form, which could later be unpacked. 

He made the same observation about this line from Chanting the Names of Mañjuśṛī, "ye shes mig gcig dri ma med," that is, "The single eye of pristine consciousness is immaculate."

Well, frankly, you need to read the Old Tibetan documents and read what they have to say about Shenrab, actual rituals that address Shenrab and so on. You need to get a subscription to Academia and read what Henk Belzer, etc., have to say on these issues. There is quite a lot of good scholarship on Bon these days. Their conclusions including Samten Karmay's, are pretty much the same as mine. 

It is quite clear that, Shenrab has been subject to extensive reshaping from shaman to cosmic world teacher at the hands of the creative writing of Bonpos, beginning with Shenchen Luga. It is not an exaggeration to say that Bon as we know it today is largely his invention. 

Of course, Sṛī Siṃha, etc., have also been subject to creative story-telling at the hands of Tibetans. It is simply that we have real third-party evidence of all these Indian figures, Garab Dorje included, and really none at all for these Bonpo figures. Pure vision is one thing; history quite another, as Norbu RInpoche remarks the book I mentioned above.

Totally. 

According to the 12th century klong sde history, the Vajra Bridge, Vairocana was eight years old when he was placed in a translation training program at Samye. He was sixteen when he was sent to India. If Dzogchen teachings existed in Zhang Zhung at that time, it would not have been necessary at all for Trisrong Detsen to send Vairocana to India, especially if the child already knew Dzogchen teachings from Zhang Zhung.

Certainly Bonpos claim Vairocana as one of their own, but it does not really make much sense, honestly.

The so called rgyal dgongs rgyud is not a mind to mind transmission. Garab Dorje was a Buddha, therefore he had all three kāyas: Samantabhadra is a name for his mind, just as Vajrasattva is a name for his speech. As for the 6.4 million slokas of Dzogchen tantras, these were written down by Mañjuśṛīmitra and divided into the three series, according to the lo rgyus chen mo, and then divided into the four cycles by Sṛī Simha, which were then given to Jñānasūtra and Vimalamitra, etc. The transmission for these texts however was given in symbols, rather than extensive discourses, hence the symbolic vidyādhara lineage. Finally, Vimalamitra, according the lo rgyus chen mo, translated these texts and gave them to  Tingzin Zangpo (who hid them in Zhva Gonpa), initiating the so called aural lineage of esteemed persons. However, this aural lineage was accompanied by texts from the beginning, since according to tradition, Vimalamitra translated many Dzogchen tantras into Tibetan, some where hidden as treasures, and others, like the thirteen later lungs, were part of the bka' ma tradition. Naturally, the historical accounts given in the so called sems sde histories and klong sde histories are represent an earlier tradition of Dzogchen teachings than the lo rgyus chen mo, and are significantly different form the lo rgyus chen mo in terms of the details they present. We have independent confirmation of the existence of Sṛī Simha, etc., in the form of an Indian polemical treatise, which dates from the late 10th century and was authored by Mañjuśṛīkīrti, that refutes the views of Sṛī Simha by name and the movement he presented. So one thing we can be quite confident about is that there was a guy name Sṛī Simha, he was a student of Mañjuśṛīmitra, he taught a radical doctrine whereby he asserted only the completion stage was necessary. Finally, we can also be certain that there was a Tibetan named Bagor Vairocana, who was the first person to translated Dzogchen texts in Tibetan, and we can also be certain that Sṛī Simha was a contemporary of Trisong Detsen. Before this period, it is extremely unlikely there was anything remotely like the teaching of the Great Perfection in Tibet. Dzogchen is wholly an Indian-inspired Vajrayāna movement. There is really no evidence that suggests otherwise.

The Bon forum was suspended because members of the board began to complain to the staff about claims certain Bonpos were making about Śākyamuni Buddha, as well as the origins of the Great Perfection, and it was decided at the time by the staff that the competing historical narratives of Buddhadharma and Bon did not fit well together. Also people could not understand why a nonBuddhist religion was being allowed space on a Buddhist board. Therefore, the forum was suspended. 

There were a lot of issues at E-Sangha -- competing narratives about the nature of Buddhadharma led to three way split-- Theravadins went their own way with Dhammawheel, David provided this space for Mahāyānis here, and the Zen folks went their separate way. Because Bon is a naturalized Tibetan form of Mahāyāna Buddhism (like all the other Tibetan Buddhist schools), whether they want to admit this or not, I guess David decided that they deserved a place here too. 

As there are few Theravadins here, and few Zen people to complain about Bon, the Bon forum has persisted largely in the form of one person making frequent posts, as well as a couple of other folks with Bonpo connections who post infrequently.

Incidentally, the information this article provides for Norbu Rinpoche's dates for the birth of Tonpa Shenrab are wrong. The correct date is 1917 BCE (see page 158, Drung, Deu and Bon), not 3927 BCE. Norbu marks this date as the beginning of Tibetan history, and it has been widely adopted by Tibetan nationalists. Norbu's Rinpoche's work in this area, by his own admission, was driven by nationalist sentiment and a desire to provide Tibetans with an ancient history on equal footing with Persia, India, and China. 

Some of his theories, such as the one that writing existed in Tibet prior to the 7th century, for example, lack convincing evidence. All Tibetan scripts descend from Gupta era scripts, including Zhang zhung dmar, and while Tonmi Sambhota himself may be a legendary personage, it is pretty clear there was no official writing system in Tibet prior to the 7th century. 

Still, he opened up important areas of research into pre-Buddhist Tibetan culture and history, along with Samten Karmay.

The myths of the twelve Teachers of Dzogchen are inspiring, but it is mythology, and quite late, textually speaking, originating from the treasure cache of Zhangton Tashi Dorje, which was revealed circa 1118, and are quite specific to Dzogchen man ngag sde. The detailed account of these twelve teachers are found in the lo rgyus chen mo, composed by Zhangton. He explains too why the twelve teachers are the twelve teachers, and why Śākyamuni is included among them, even though the latter never actually taught Dzogchen directly in this world. The reason is as follows. The conventional account of a Buddha's life is that they perform twelve deeds. All Buddhas do this. But the twelve teachers are unique in that they perform 108 deeds: thirty-six for the body, speech, and mind of the dharmakāya; thirty-six for the body, speech, and mind of the sambhogakāya, and thirty-six for the body, speech, and mind of the nirmanakāya. So these twelve teachers are considered unique by virtue of their 108 deeds, and are unlike all other buddhas for this reason. The inner meaning of this is pretty clear: 12 deeds X nine yānas.

Bon Dzogchen is quite excellent. It does not mean one must accept the Bonpo alternate version of Tibetan history hook, line, and sinker.

Title: Re: Sogyal, etc. split from THE SELF-ARISEN VIDYA TANTRA thread
Content:
No, that is not the controversy. Most Buddhist gurus are ordinary people, who have expertise in certain ritual systems and the conferral of certain kinds of teachings. 

Fundamental to this system is pure vision. Pure vision is from our side. We are supposed to understand that the guru from whom we receive empowerment is same as the buddhas of the three times. If we do not have this idea, it is held, than we cannot benefit from their teaching. As practitioners on the path, we are supposed to understand the universe and all the beings in it as members of the same mandala, sublime deities, buddhas; not hell beings, pretas, etc. We exercise our pure perception by practicing deity yoga and guru yoga. When we realize that everything has never been different than the state of buddhahood, and that everything has always been the state of buddhahood from the very beginning, this realization is called mahāmudra, the great symbol; or mahāsandhi, the great perfection. 

The controversy exists because there are teachings which indicate that prospective students need to be vetted on the basis of their intelligence, devotion, and lack of concepts. Likewise, gurus are vetted on the basis of their education, expertise, and personal qualities, but not their ultimate realization—how can any normal person perceive that? 

Plainly put, sometimes qualified gurus pick unqualified students, and this causes problems. Likewise, qualified students sometimes pick unqualified gurus. Thus, some in the Sogyal scandal think Sogyal was an unqualified guru. Others think that Sogyal chose unqualified students, or students who broke their samaya. Frankly, from a traditional point of view, there is no way one can argue that those letter-writing students did not injure their samaya when they composed their letter, since they all received empowerments from and with Sogyal. The whole point of samaya vows is to maintain the integrity of the Vajrayāna Sangha. The very first samaya vow is that one should not harshly criticize one's guru. This is even worse than criticizing the Buddha himself. The second one is that one should not cause conflict with vajra siblings. 

Vajrayāna disciples are expected to regard everything their guru does as sacred, unless it directly violates Dharma ethics. Hitting a disciple with the intention to benefit them is well within that range. It is not acceptable in our culture, but it is quite acceptable in Tibetan culture. Having multiple sexual partners (if unmarried) is fine, so is being a sybarite. 

What is not acceptable is taking life, taking what is not given, speaking with intent to deceive, and sexual misconduct, the four basis of training. Of course, excluding sex crimes, these four can also be given a pass if performed with bodhicitta motivation. 

Anyone can leave the company of a given guru with or without cause, but if someone has taken samaya vows with someone who is qualified to give them, then one should never harshly criticize that person. 

When it comes to Dharma ethics, we in the West tend to treat these as legal frameworks, but they are not. If anything, the Rigpa affair points to the deficit in corporate-style Buddhism; where feeder programs are created in order to introduce people into the path; who are in turn vetted for their actual interest in higher teachings and so on. Most of the people in Rigpa are not Vajrayāna students, just as most of the people in Shambhala Centers are not Vajrayāna students. So if these people think that Sogyal and Mukpo suck, there is no problem. But it becomes a problem when one enters into a samaya relationship. 

The whole system of Vajrayāna is based on the unassailable authority of the guru. So, caveat emptor.

It would not have screened out anyone anyway. You see, we are Anglos. We believe in laws. We live in nations where laws are above persons. 

Tibet was not like that, as you know. Tibet had no legal system to speak of. No courts, no jails, just aristocrats with their soldiers meting out punishments based on local custom and personal capriciousness. The Tibetan establishment is still based on this idea. 

If Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodo says Y is the tulku of X, that is it. There is no council that recognizes tulkus. It is all based on the word of a man. 

For example, Dilgo Khyentse's family was the wealthiest family in the Derge region. Of course, this does not reflect poorly on Dilgo Khyentse, but since his family was the number 1 sponsor of Khyentse Wangpo, they had a significant say in the disposition of the Khyentse Ladrang's estate after his death. This is one of the reasons why there was significant tension between adherents of Loter Wangpo's Khyentse tulku, and the adherents of Chokyi Lodo, etc., who preferred him for various reasons, probably because Loter Wangpo was not from Kham, but rather, Tsang, and ceding the Khyentse Ladrang would have been ceding enormous wealth to someone who has not a Khampa.

You are forgetting that a large number of bhikṣus were educated brahmins. Also, the Buddha very likely knew Sanskrit, since he shows familiarity with Vedas, and could converse with brahmins in this language. 

I think the situation on the ground is considerably more complicated than this idea that Buddha taught in Prakrit, and then this was translated later into Sanskrit. Clearly no one was concerned to preserve the Buddha's actual words in the dialect in which the Buddha actually taught, since there are too many dialects in which he taught in various places in Central India. But this of course has nothing at all do with the history of Vajrayāna.

The Democrats lost precisely because they were backing the unions, which were wholly undermined by GOP "right to work" laws aimed at undermining unions. This was deliberate, since the GOP understood that unions were the main constituency of the Democrats:

"By weakening the relationship between Democrats and unions, we anticipate that RTW laws will drive state policy—including, but not restricted to labor policies—in a rightward direction. We hypothesize that this will be a product of the direct electoral effects of RTW laws: by favoring the election of GOP candidates to state legislatures and governorships, states with RTW laws in place will be more likely to have partially or fully Republican- controlled governments. But RTW laws should also move policy to the right even when states are fully or partially controlled by Democrats. With labor unions a less central member of the Democratic party coalition, we expect that Democrats will have less reason to pursue the left-leaning economic policies favored by labor unions (e.g. Bawn et al. (2012)). And to the extent that RTW laws make it harder for working class state legislative candidates to win office, that should also move state policy to the right."

And:


"The anti-tax political activist Grover Norquist recently declared that while President Trump may be historically unpopular, the GOP could still “win big” in 2020. The secret to the Republican party’s long-term success, Norquist argued, involved state-level initiatives to weaken the power of labor unions. As Norquist explained it, if union reforms cutting the power of labor unions to recruit and retain members—like RTW laws—“are enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic Party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics.” A weaker labor movement, Norquist reasoned, would not just have economic consequences. It would also have significant political repercussions, meaning that Democrats would have substantially less of a grassroots presence on the ground during elections and less money to invest in politics."

And:

"Working class candidates—politicians most likely to be backed by the labor movement—are less likely to hold office in states fol- lowing the passage of RTW laws. State policy as a whole, moreover, moved sharply to the ideological right in RTW states following the passage of those laws."


https://businessinnovation.berkeley.edu ... ct2017.pdf

Ergo, what we need in the USA is a broad, renewed labor movement, and Bernie Sanders is the only person who can lead this movement. The reason the voice of the working class in America has been muted has everything to do with GOP successes in state legislatures, and nothing at all to do with some imagined abandonment of the working class by left-wing intelligentsia.

Tantras do not equal texts. There are of course textual artifacts that are called "tantras," but that is not really what a tantra is in the Vajrayāna tradition.

What we are referring to as a "tantra" when we are talking about a text artifact is a practice manual. But that is a very limited scope.

First, you must choose a career that aligns with right livelihood. Nursing is one of the best careers for a buddhist. It is flexible, portable, and it involves caring directly for people who are suffering. It also allows one to do retreat attend teachings and so on.

It somewhat depends on what you mean by "tantric," an imprecise term at best. The earliest texts that we have which involve conferring empowerments and advocating mantra recitation, fire offerings, and so on as paths to buddhahood seem to have emerged in early 7th century in South India, near Nagārjunakota, and other places, such as the Swat Valley, and were first promulgated outside of India to Khotan in Central Asia, Java, etc., and China. By 800 CE, all the formative material which characterizes later Vajrayāna teachings were firmly established traditions in India and elsewhere, and had been adopted into the Monastic Universities. The Siddha tradition also seems to have emerged in the mid 8th century, circa 750 CE. However, most of what we know about the origin of Vajrayāna is in second-hand sources, due to the destruction of great monasteries and their libraries at end of the 12th century.

Simply put, we need to change the laws in order to force corporations to behave for the benefit of sentient beings, and not for the exclusive benefit of their shareholders. This is how corporations used to be structured in the early USA: a given body that wished to form a corporation had to present their business plan to their local community, and then that body was either given a time-limited corporate charter (generally seven years), or denied. At the end of that charter, it came up for review, and either continued or denied, depending on the social benefit or ill that corporation rendered to that community.

Best guess has it that traditions began to diverge during the Buddha's lifetime.

Every Indic text we have is a translation out of one Indic language into another, whether Pali, Gandhari, or Sanskrit.

Suffice it to say, we do not know exactly which Mahāyāna sūtra is the oldest; but we do have some idea which ones may precede the common era. One positive argument for the PP in 8000 lines is its universal popularity in India and its role as an object of devotion, not really accorded to other sūtras even in the same class. I have always personally wanted to have a copy inscribed in precious ink, in my book it is the single most important Mahāyana sūtra there is. YMMV.

"Corporation" is a name for a specific type of collective. If you admit that collectives can command, then you admit corporations can command. 

Of course, we are discussing nothing more than a convention. But this is why we have the term "conventional truth." Unfortunately for your argument, conventions do not bring entities in being. Entities appear, and are then given conventional designations. We also do not create sentience. From the point of view of Buddhadharma, a given stream of consciousness has no start point, no creator. I also stated that corporations were merely legal persons; but as legal persons they are given rights, have agency, and so on. So-called "individuals" are no more immune to deconstructive analysis than any other composite entity— hence the five aggregates, twelve sense bases, and eighteen sense elements.

The fourth empowerment common to gsar ma and snying ma is a kind of introduction, but it is not sufficient for practicing Dzogchen, so to answer your question directly, the empowerment is not foundation for any practice. One also needs to also have further introductions and liberating instructions. And there are further introductions one will need beyond that. For example, the Meteoric Razor (gnam lcags spu gri) Vajrakilaya tradition of Dudjom Lingpa, even after one has received the empowerment in a proper way, it is assumed one will have practiced in some detail the preliminaries, creation and completion stage, then the special Dzogchen preliminaries. Nevertheless, one needs specific further introductions in order to practice the main practices of Dzogchen. 

Likewise, in the Jonang tradition, merely receiving the outer four empowerments is not sufficient for practicing the six limb yoga; or in Lamdre, merely receiving the cause empowerment, which has all four empowerments, is not sufficient for practicing the pratices associated with the three inner empowerments, one needs also the path empowerment and the blessing empowerment of Vajrayogini/Nairatma.

The four snying thig empowerments are subdivisions of the fourth empowerment, actually. Basically, if you are interested in Dzogchen, you need to find someone you believe is a real Dzogchen practitioner to receive teachings from. Right now, I think Khenpo Namdrol is the best teacher available to westerners from whom to learn Dzogchen, due to the depth and length of his explanations. But it is not so easy to meet him. There are many other qualified teachers out there as well. But choose wisely, many Tibetan Lamas hold up a deer's tail, but sell horse meat instead. Thus, caveat emptor.

Well, for example, it is said the retributive result of killing is that plants, the sun, and so on have diminished vitality; by stealing beings are crushed by stones, or dust storms and acid rain; sexual misconduct results in being covered with dust or caustic materials; lying causes one to smell bad or be in a place with bad odors; malicious speech causes one to be inhabit holes and hilly regions; harsh speech causes one to live in a place where the soil is either contaminated with salt or infertile, and the plants are pernicious and so on; gossip results the seasons being out of order; greed results in small fruits; hatred result in sour fruit; wrong view results in few fruits, if any. There are many such descriptions one can read in various places. 

The basic idea is that every action has a result which must be experienced providing its cause has not been cut off either through rebirth into a realm where such negative results cannot come to fruition or the elimination of the karmic obscuration. 

Theravadins have a diffent idea in so far as they understand some things to merely be a manifestation of conditions, such as plane crashes, etc., not necessarily tied to a specific act on one's part.

According to Sarvastivadin Abhidharma, no. Since both Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna are largely grounded in this system, the answer you will generally receive is that any and all results one experiences, including the creation and dissolution of the universe are all results of individual karma.

The so called Vajrayoginī cave in the Wild River, in Bristol, VT. is right here: https://goo.gl/maps/Cve4gvc8mMw6UBFc8. It is a very popular swimming spot frequented by thousands of people every year in the summer.The bank from the road down to the river is quite steep, and the cave can only be entered by wading through the manmade pool in front of its entrance. I have been in this cave, which is located behind the waterfall in the picture, many times, and yes, this is the cave that HH Chetsang Rinpoche allegedly identified as a source of sindhura. The original source of this story is David Arndt. When asked about it, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa did not agree, and thought it was just an ordinary place with ordinary clay, not sindhura at all. David was very disappointed to hear this, and chooses still to advertise this location as a Vajrayogini place. For him and the Drigung faithful, it is such a place. For others, not so much. 

As for the "cave" on Deer Leap Rock (http://obscurevermont.com/wp-content/up ... 59_pe1.jpg), KDL did not have a dream about it, he just thought there was a cave up there, and when Pema Wangdi and David went up to investigate, sure enough there was a rock overhang that might serve as a cave with some improvements. I was in Lincoln the day they reported discovering a cave up there, though did not walk up there myself, as I was busy attending KDL. KDL thought that if there was a cave up there, as he suspected, it would be a good place to do retreat, having spent many years as a wandering mendicant before finally settling down in Rangapara, Assam. Also, I was in the car with KDL when he first noticed the rock face and opined it might have a cave. It was a result of his yogi's eye, and not a dream, that led to the discovery of that cave. He never mentioned anything about phurpas in relationship to that cave in my hearing. But I was not with him 24/7/365. 

As far as Lincoln, VT. itself goes, however, it is the first place in the US where Kalu Rinpoche had a place, and has hosted many lamas over the years, principally Kagyu and Nyingma Lamas. It is a very special town, one of the most impressive towns in VT, from the point of view of its views and location. Some places one can look right down the valley and see Lake Champlain. The mountain range behind  it has the appearance of a women lying on her side in repose, and Mt. Abe has the distinct shape of a breast. On eastern side of these mountains are a number of ski resorts, like Mad River Glen, etc. I am actually looking at Mt. Abe as I write this to you. So, sindhura or not, Lincoln VT. is a special place, where I have received many wonderful teachings from fantastic gurus, and that is really the main point.

I am personally sorry that it is has come to this point, but I have done nothing wrong, and have at heart only the interest of people learning and progressing in the true Dharma that exists in the nine yānas the Buddha taught in correspondence with each person's individual inclinations. To that end, I have introduced scores of people to qualified teachers, and answered thousands of questions about all aspects of Dharma to the best of my ability. Now, my sojourn in these waters must come to an end. In the interest of comity, I am permanently signing off. I will not be looking at this board again, so I will see no further personal messages.

No, the object of cognition is not "representation only," (vijñāptimatra) for it it were, there would be no difference between Cittamātra and general Madhyamaka. 

I get a little tired of repeating myself, but here it goes again: 

Because all entities can be perceived veridically,
it is found that all entities can be apprehended with two natures.
When some object that is perceived veridically, that is true. 
All [objects] perceived falsely are said to be relative truths. 


Candra continues:

"The buddhas that know with correct wisdom the intrinsic nature of the two truths have taught that all external entities such as formations, sprouts, and so on, have two intrinsic natures. These [natures] are relative and ultimate. 

This excludes your contention that what is being referred to are mental representations. 

He continues:

The ultimate is the acquisition of the essential identity of the specific object of the wisdom (jñāna) that sees the truth, but is not established through its own nature. This is the first nature. The other is all the mental eyes of ordinary people that are obscured with opthalmia and cataracts, which find an existent self from the power of false perception. Whatever becomes the object of the perception of children,  such a nature is not intrinsically established. Therefore, the nature of all entities are apprehended in these two ways. 

Frankly, the frustrating thing about you is that you don't do your homework, and don't seem to bother to educate yourself about these things. This is the main reason why I have no interest in your exercises in logic. It is a waste of time, for me, because your logic is not grounded in citation. Time and again, in order to even have a discussion, I define terms, which you consistently ignore, based on some personal criteria which is opaque at best. We have wasted the better part of thread supposedly devoted to Dzogchen to just running on the same hamster wheel. So am I out.

Gomadevi, like Mandarava and Yeshe Tsogyal, is a realized historical personage. In her case, she is a realized Dzogchen master who attained the highest realization. Therefore, there can be no questioning the validity of her practice, especially given her association with Guhyajñāna.  

Achi Chokyi Drolma, Sakya Pandita, Lonchenpa, Marpa, Mila, Gampopa, Karma Pakshi, etc. are realized historical personages, they all have guru sadhanas, etc.. There is no tantra, per se, that recommends Śakyamuni Buddha as a yidam or Bhaisajyaguru as a Yidam, but indeed, we have kriya tantra practices of these figures, which can be practiced as self-generations by those who have received HYT initiations. The procedures for this are very clearly explained in the tantras. 

For all of these practices, precedent can be found in the tantras for the elaboration of their practices.  For those practices like Krodhakālī, one, she is a form of Vajravārāhi, whose practice is fully explained in mother tantras; 2) her sadhana was received from a ḍākinī in Oddiyāna by Mahāsiddha Virupa and transmitted to Tibet by Padampa Sangye, and so on. 

But there are no practices involving mundane protectors like Indra, Vaiśravana, and so on, as yidams. And we know what HH Dalai Lama says about relying on mundane protectors as enlightened. He could not have been more clear.

Hi Wayfarer:

The key to understanding everything is the term "dependent designation." We don't question the statement "I am going to town." In this there are three appearances, for convenience's sake, a person, a road, and a destination. 

A person is designated on the basis of the aggregates, but there is no person in the aggregates, in one of the aggregates, or separate from the aggregates. Agreed? A road is designated in dependence on its parts, agreed? A town s designated upon its parts. Agreed?

If you agree to this, then you should have no problem with the following teaching of the Buddha in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa Sūtra:

This body arises from various conditions, but lacks a self. This body is like the earth, lacking an agent. This body is like water, lacking a self. This body is like fire, lacking a living being. This body is like the wind, lacking a person. This body is like space, lacking a nature. This body is the place of the four elements, but is not real. This body that is not a self nor pertains to a self is empty.

In other words, when it comes to the conventional use of language, Buddha never rejected statements like "When I was a so and so in a past life, I did so and so, and served such and such a Buddha." Etc. But when it comes to what one can discern on analysis, if there is no person, no self, etc., that exists as more than a mere designation, the fact that agents cannot be discerned on analysis should cause no one any concern. It is merely a question of distinguishing between conventional use of language versus the insight into the nature of phenomena that results from ultimate analysis.
