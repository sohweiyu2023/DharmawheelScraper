There are three essential books you need to have to understand ChNN's presentation of Dzogchen: the Guruyoga book; the Precious Vase, and the Song of the Vajra book. Now that you have received transmission from YSN, you can purchase these books and learn from them. Many Dzogchen practices such as the separation of samsara and nirvana as well as the semzins can be practiced with no further required transmissions other than a direct introduction. So now it is up to you. You practice these things, you gain some experience, and then you will have something to ask about. In the meantime, without some experience, you will not have any real valid questions. First things first, however. Learn Song of the Vajra. It is the supreme method of discovering your real nature.

The term semzin is a translation of the term dharāṇa, as as it sounds, it is a prelude to dhyāna and samādhi. 

There are twenty-one semzins mentioned explicitly in the the Dzogchen tantras and there is a smaller subset identified by . They are divided into three groups: the first group of seven are for placing the mind in a calm state; the second group of seven are for parting mind and body; and the third group of seven are for entering into dharmatā. Then there is rushan practice. But as I already mentioned, Longchenpa criticizes the approach of normative śamatha and vipaśyanā, which is object-bases. You might object, the semzins are object based as well. However, the semszin are structured in a logical sequence which indeed is more efficient, and allow one to easily discover the natural dhyāna of rig pa, which after all is the point. 

This is far more effective than trying to achieve perfect śamatha, which is still based in mind, and is without any method of nakedly exposing rig pa.

If it isn't trekchö, it isn't Dzogchen. A beginner's practice should be focused on developing trekchö, systematically using the semzins and rushans. Sure, one can also apply Dzogchen view to the cultivation of the first dhyāna or also deity yoga using the six limb approach, but in reality, klong sde and man ngag sde are faster and more certain than these sems sde approaches.

The idea that one needs to spend months and years on developing śamatha according the middle Bhāvanakrama of Kamalaśila is misguided, from the point of view of Longchenpa. Longchenpa very specifically criticizes this approach in chapter 10 of the autocommentary of the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu.

Considering that their goal is personal salvation, this is not surprising in the least. There is no bodhicitta in Christianity, nor Hinduism, Islam, etc., regardless of their charitable motivations.

I am referring to Ephesians 6:5:

Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. 

There are several similar passages in the New Testament.

That’s topic 2 of the 11 topics of dzogchen., the liberation of Samantabhadra and the delusion of sentient beings.

This has nothing to do with what you agree or disagree with Jules. There is considerable room for improvement in your understanding of Dzogchen. For example, are you going to disagree with Vimalamitra when he states:

Thus, ignorance (ma rig pa) depends on knowledge (rig pa) and delusion depends on nondelusion. As such, knowledge (rig pa) itself becomes ignorance (ma rig pa) and nondelusion becomes delusion.

Or the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra, pg. 196

Ignorance (ma rig pa) is realized essentially to be knowledge (rig pa);
concepts are realized to be the state of dharmatā;
the five attachments and aversions are the five pristine
consciousnesses;
the five objects are realized as the pure five lights..

Or, on page 274:

Vidyā (which can neither be clarified nor obscured)
and (the various appearances of) ignorance
are inseparable, realized to be one entity.

Or page 286:

Both knowledge (rig pa) and ignorance (ma rig pa) are also concepts of grasping.

Or page 354:

“The example for vidyā and ignorance is the form of water and ripples—
depending on conditions.

Other examples that are used for rig pa and ma rig pa being the same entity are water and ice, etc. 

At the time when the basis stirred, Samantabhadra never entered into delusion, but in the first moment, he experienced ignorance—the ignorance of the same identical cause and the connate ignorance. Khenpo Ngachung affirms this in his notes on Nyoshul Khenpo's thogal teaching, folio 17/a, when Nyoshul Khenpo discusses the liberation of Samantabhadra: "Both of those [ignorances] existed for Samantabhadra, but wisdom (prajñā) arose at that juncture."

The whole point of Dzogchen is to understand how ignorance arose and how to reverse that process. You keep on inventing artificial criteria which are not reflected in the tradition and certainly are not consistent with how my teachers have taught Dzogchen teachings. Since I don't want to insult your teachers, I can only conclude that you have not studied hard enough and have been content with a superficial understanding the subject.

The object of the mental consciousness sense base (mano-āyatana) is the contents of the sense base of phenomena (dharmas) among the twelve sense bases, just as the object of eye consciousness sense base is the form sense base. The content of the sense base of phenomena is all mental activity, the ten neutral mental factors, applied attention, sustained attention, the ten positive mental factors, the six negative mental factors, the 14 afflicted mental factors, and so on. 

From Stainless Space (supporting trekcho text):

 Just as reflections arise in limpid water (chu dwangs), the eyes and clairvoyances will arise from limpid vidyā.  Moreover, one should practice by leaving the [six] sense faculties in their own limpidity (rang dwangs) without obstruction. Since the main sense organ, the eyes, are limpid, vidyā is limpid, because the eyes are the actual door of pristine consciousness. Otherwise, just as the appearance of reflections do not condition the water, [35/b] likewise, even though all outer appearances arise as a brilliant vision, since one’s consciousness does become lost among such appearances, it is said “they are not established in vidyā"...

Now then, if one becomes mindless (dran med) when meditating through blocking the group of six [eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and consciousness], one will deviate into an ignorant meditation. 

If one meditates having blocked the six outer objects, although there is mindfulness (dran pa), since objects are not clear, it is called “falling into one-sided śamatha”, and one will be reborn in the formless realms and so on. 

Though objects appear, since extremes have not been eliminated by the view, merely abiding in a mind of clarity and emptiness is a trace for being reborn in the form realm and so on. 

Therefore, having recognized that vidyā as liberated from extremes, it is very important that while in the state where there is no grasping to any objects or consciousness, objects are clear and vidyā is limpid. That is the pristine consciousness liberated from the three realms, called "the transcendent state of the universe and beings resting in the basis." 


The vijñānaskandha, the aggregate of consciousness, itself is already nonconceptual by nature. When it perceives mental objects, such as a concept it takes another name, called "mental consciousness" (manovijñāna)." When it perceives form, it takes the name "eye consciousness" (cakṣurvijñāna). 

Longchenpa is here indicating that you do not block the senses, which includes manas, the mental organ, nor to you block concepts, and so on, which are the object of the mental organ. The point is to not allow accepting or rejecting of either objects or consciousness.
