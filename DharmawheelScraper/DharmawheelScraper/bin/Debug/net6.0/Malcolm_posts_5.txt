Tathāgatagarbha is just a name for the innate purity of consciousness, which when realized is called "dharmakāya."  It's synonyms are luminosity (prabhāśvara) and so on. Some people cannot relate to emptiness, it scares them, so we teach them about the innate purity of consciousness until they can deal with the ultimate view.

It is regarded as an Ekayāna sūtra, meaning that it is a source for the idea that there is really only one Buddhist path.

There is no detailed commentarial tradition on the Lotus. It is frequently cited mainly with respect to its assertion that the Buddha will manifest in the future as gurus. 

The only detailed treatment of the Lotus I have ever seen in Tibetan is a review of the parable of the Nāga princess by Chogyal Phakpa, who clarifies that she was already a bodhisattva abiding on the tenth stage, which is why her transformation into a male and subsequent buddhahood could be so rapid. He probably wrote this in response to Chinese Buddhists pointing out this example as proof of sudden awakening.

“Science” exists as empirical knowledge. That’s it. Nothing more, nothing less. Most Western Buddhists accept it without question. Science, being empirical, also has limitations, because not all knowledge is empirical, such as belief systems, including belief systems about science.

Buddhists accept certain kinds of nonempirical knowledge. The most important of these are the causes of suffering, suffering itself being birth in the three realms. Anyone who properly understands Buddhadharma understands that affliction-driven action is the cause of suffering. And suffering only ceases if affliction-driven action ceases because affliction-driven action causes birth in samsara. All that liberation is, is freedom from birth in samsara due to affliction-driven action. There is no liberation taught by the Buddha other than that.

These people are secular humanists who like to sit on cushions and practice śamatha, and that is all they are or ever will be, as long as they do not address the fundamental question the Buddha solved. There is no liberation apart from eradication of the afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms. Any other kind of liberation is not the liberation the Buddha taught.

Sonam Tsomo had regular contact with Indians due to Sakya’s position on trade routes. It was a major stopping point for Indian masters who were on teaching tours in Western Tibet, as well as Tibetan translators, and like his father and brother, his Sanskrit was good. The second throne holder of Sakya was Bari Lotsawa, who spend some years in India, etc. 

The point about the four castes and four divisions of tantra is behavior— each division offers behavior amenable to the mores of a certain type of person. For example, vegans can’t practice HYT, due to meat being a required sacrament, etc.

DJKR's has made a number of fallacious historical claims, but perhaps the most telling historical gaffe was the one where he attributed the decline of Buddhism in Japan to Americans after WWII. I pointed out to him that the decline of Buddhism in Japan was a function of the Meiji restoration, where 45k Buddhist temples were destroyed by the Japanese gvt. in the late 19th century, etc. 

LKY's problem (among others) is that he thought the US was trying to foist democracy off on everyone. The actual fact is that during the Cold War, that US was saying to countries: "If you want to do business with us, and have access to our markets, you can't do business with the Communists governments. If you decide to implement liberal democracy, so much the better, but at minimum you can't do business with Communists. If your country already has significant access to Western capital investment, and you try to align with the Communists and nationalize our investments in your country, we are going to take your government down and replace it with someone who better aligns with our interests and will protect our capital investments." 

The failures in US foreign policy after the Cold War mainly come from this line of reasoning: "Communism will inevitably fail. It failed in Russia and it will fail in China. We should do business with Russia and China based on this assumption. The only thing we have to worry about now are the recalcitrant Muslim countries, who are state sponsors for terrorism. Liberal democracy driven capitalist development is inevitable. Resistance is futile."

The difference is pragmatism. Our Cold War foreign policy was pragmatic, occasionally dressed up in ideology. Our Post-Cold War foreign policy has been ideological, and abandoned pragmatism for slogans.

DJKR is polarizing. Many people think his approach to Sogyal's scandal was insincere, and his unconditional admiration for Trungpa really gross. They don't like his support for Aung San Su Kyi, and his take on the present war. 

Many people don't agree with his take on guru devotion, etc. 

You have to recognize, Magnus, that he has set himself up for criticism by being so vocal in his opinions. There are many Tibetans who really don't like him either, because he has criticized the Dalai Lama by criticizing the Dalai Lama's emphasis on Nalanda masters. So, pick a controversial guru, you get controversy. A lot of Tibetans (like Dzongsar) don't like ChNN, even now. He was also controversial in his day, especially when he was writing in the 1970's. Much of that is because the book that was recently published, Necklace of Jewels where he first began to synthesize his deconstruction of the imperial era myths about the nonexistence of Tibetan culture before the introduction of Buddhism, etc. 

Pick a controversial guru, you are going to hear a lot of people voice criticisms of that guru. It's natural. But it is not fatal. And it does not negate that person's positive contributions. For example, the 84000 project, as I mentioned before this, is a very good use of DJKR's title and money.

This is a funny question. Chatral Rinpoche didn’t know English, not one word. There is no way he can endorse one English translation against another. 

Two of these translations are restricted: the Padma Publishung one and the new Shambhala one. Wallace’s is not, but Wallace also received the transmission for these things from Gyatrul R. 

It’s all really moot, actually. Of course my personal practice is to get the lung for things I want to read, but I am not anyone’s boss. All I can say is that having at least the poti wang makes a connection with the texts. I can encourage people to get lungs, but it’s really up to them.

Of course, this only applies to educated Tibetans. Prior to 1959, only 15% of the Tibetan population was actually literate.

He is referring to people who expect Vajrayāna gurus to conform to conventional Buddhist ethics. Such people, he writes, should stick with common Mahāyāna, because somehow, there is some magical substance in Vajrayāna samayas that make you fall into hell if you disapprove of your guru's conduct or resist their abuse, should they in fact be abusive in a real sense. 

Somehow, in some people's minds, the ritual of empowerment creates a magical chain that turns one into a Buddhist serf if one should take empowerment. This idea is perfectly understandable in the context of Tibetan culture, as the Tibetans tend to view the relationship between teacher and student as something resembling a lord and a vassal. Of course in the real world, it does not necessarily play out like this at all. But generally people like to use the fantasy novel about Milarepa written in the 15th century, or the accounts of Naropa's trials under Tilopa as proof that we should allow our gurus to torture us for our own good, excusing the pathological behavior of Trungpa and others on such grounds. 

In his writings DJKR devotes thousands of words to criticizing people who are offended when they are treated badly by some Vajrayāna teacher and wish to leave, basically asserting that feeling harmed by some person they participated in a ritual with means they will never achieve liberation, not even considering for one second that the real situation is that student and that teacher do not have the right karmic connection at all and it is better for them to separate. The real problem here is a catechistic and realist interpretation of samaya and a failure to appreciate that teachers can and do break samaya with their students. This point is never actually addressed in any comprehensive way by DJKR in any of his writings. In his writings, the onus is always placed on the student to behave, never the teacher. 

As far as DJKR's politics go, well, he likes to stir things up and create controversy. But over the years a very distinct pattern of conservatism has emerged—there is nothing good at all about the West, and basically, I am quite sure that in his mind we should go back to the some time where there was an enlightened dharmarāja to run the world (which is a fantasy). I find in his writings a great deal of nostalgia. He seems to be akin to what Ann Applebaum, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post, describes as a nostalgic conservative:

Radically different from the reflective nostalgics are what Boym calls the restorative nostalgics, not all of whom recognize themselves as nostalgics at all. Restorative nostalgics don’t just look at old photographs and piece together family stories. They are mythmakers and architects, builders of monuments and founders of nationalist political projects. They do not merely want to contemplate or learn from the past. They want, as Boym puts it, to “rebuild the lost home and patch up the memory gaps.” Many of them don’t recognize their own fictions about the past for what they are: “They believe their project is about truth.” They are not interested in a nuanced past, in a world in which great leaders were flawed men, in which famous military victories had lethal side effects. They don’t acknowledge that the past might have had its drawbacks. They want the cartoon version of history, and more importantly, they want to live in it, right now. They don’t want to act out roles from the past because it amuses them: they want to behave as they think their ancestors did, without irony.

It is not by accident that restorative nostalgia often goes hand in hand with conspiracy theories and the medium-sized lies. These needn’t be as harsh or crazy as the Smolensk conspiracy theory or the Soros conspiracy theory; they can gently invoke scapegoats rather than a full-fledged alternative reality. At a minimum, they can offer an explanation: The nation is no longer great because someone has attacked us, undermined us, sapped our strength. Someone—the immigrants, the foreigners, the elites, or indeed the EU—has perverted the course of history and reduced the nation to a shadow of its former self. The essential identity that we once had has been taken away and replaced with something cheap and artificial. Eventually, those who seek power on the back of restorative nostalgia will begin to cultivate these conspiracy theories, or alternative histories, or alternative fibs, whether or not they have any basis in fact.

Applebaum, Anne. Twilight of Democracy (p. 74-75). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. 

In DJKR's case, it seems he feels that it westerners and democracy itself are attacking, undermining, and sapping the strength of the Dharma. Take this post on Facebook:



In short, he really dislikes the West and liberal democracy. Not sure what he wants to replace it with...

Corporate Buddhism is horrible. All the big scandals come from such entities. 

Is it a surprise that the Lenz Foundation is sponsoring this? No. Fredrick Lenz was a huge fraud. The Lenz Foundation has about as much to do with Buddhism as Exxon has to do with combatting climate change. 

Lenz’s grift was “American Buddhism.” His scheme was to get naive people to come to concerts by his Kitaro influenced new age band, Zazen, and call that meditation. He wrote stupid, orientalist adventure novels that make T. Lobsang Rampa look credible by comparison, such memorable titles as Surfing in the Himalayas, featuring, I kid you not, a fellow named Master Fwap, etc. The more intelligent people he sent to school to learn computer science, set them up with Wall Street jobs, and tithed them 10%. In this way he became wealthy very quickly through his software company filled with devotees. But it all had nothing to do with Buddhadharma. 

After Lenz’s suicide/accidental death (it’s not clear which), one of his main students married one of Namkhai Drime Rinpoche’s daughters. Her sister married Mukpo and became queen of Shambhala. You can guess the rest. 

The advisory board for the Lenz Foundation is telling:

Liz Lewinson, Chairperson
B. A. Smith, Co-Chairperson
Dr. Koshin Paley Ellison, MFA, LMSW, DMin, co-founder, the New York Zen Center for Contemplative Care
Lisa Marshall, CEO, Rama Meditation Society
Acharya Fleet Maull, Prison Dharma Network
Jeffrey Richardson, Sr. Consulting Information Technology Architect, IBM
James Shaheen, Editor and Publisher – Tricycle: The Buddhist Review
Judith Simmer-Brown, Ph.D., Professor of Contemplative and Religious Studies, Naropa University 


 I wouldn’t participate in one of their conferences if you paid me. This isn’t about getting butts onto cushions, it’s about legitimizing one of the biggest grifters in the short history of Buddhism in the West.

The point is that motivation is the underlying determining factor for whether a bodhisattva has broken their vows, not the action itself. 

There is a vast literature in Tibetan Buddhism on the three vows. I personally agree with Sakya Pandita's point of view, where the higher vow contradicts the lower vow, one follows the higher vow. 

For example, he points out that bodhisattva bhikṣus can handle gold and silver, own property, engage in trade, etc. This is prohibited for śrāvaka bhikṣus. Likewise, Vajrayāna bhikṣus can eat meat, drink alcohol, which is prohibited for Mahāyāna bhkṣus.

Anything for the cause, as long as it is really for the benefit of others.

The usual example is the bodhisattva bhikṣu who had sex with a young women who threatened to kill herself if he did not make love to her. His prātimoḳsa defeat is not considered a defeat in the bodhisattvasamvara. 

It is the same for the other defeats.

The Buddha of the śrāvaka canon is far less practical than the Buddha of the mahāyāna canon.

There is a liquid substance perceived by those in the six lokas. It may not be perceived the same way by beings in the six lokas, but there is still a liquid substance which is being perceived, which stands apart from the percepts of the beings in those six lokas through its own causes and conditions. Can sentient beings ever hope to know with precise accuracy the exact nature of that liquid substance in all its aspects and its nature? Sure, when one of them attains buddhahood. 

In the meantime, functionality is the best measure of conventionality, which is why Meru cosmology could never be functional, not even when it was current. On the other hand, we did not have the tech to fly to the moon even 100 years ago, so it is moot. Nevertheless, Meru cosmology would never have permitted us to fly to the moon, and therefore, it was always a dysfunctional cosmology on a conventional level, but no one needed to question this for millenia. 

There are always people who will forever go down the idealist rabbit hold of Bishop Berkley and what not, but at least Dzogchen teachings firmly maintain, conventionally speaking, the objective existence of outer objects, contra the metaphysics of yogacāra, even in its Madhyamaka version.

A Sutra in the Ratnakuṛa collection, Taisho 310, called the Definitive Vinaya in Chang's translation, will explain this point. 

Bodhisattva monks are not prohibited from breaking any of the samvara of śrāvakas providing it is done with bodhicitta.

In the Nāgārjuna tradition of bodhisattva vows, the downfall of claiming realization of emptiness, when you do not have it, applies only to so-called "acute" practitioners, not average practitioners. 

In the Yogacāra system, it is a downfall not break engage in a nonvirtue if performed out of compassion. You can read these in Buddhist Ethics by Kongtrul. 

In short, the only real downfall in Mahāyāna is abandoning aspirational bodhicitta.

All dualistic referents, such as outside, inside, up, down, large, small, etc., are axiomatically relative.

What makes something conventional is whether or not something is functional. Asserting there is nothing outside the mind renders cognition dysfunctional, unless one then substitutes an elaborate metaphysics to account for the cognition of sense objects, for example, yogacāra.

We are in volume two of the Adzom Parma published in 1977. 

The next longest tantra of the 17 after the Rangshar is the ancillary tantra, called the Self-Originated Perfection, rdzogs pa rang byung, which contains many ritual methods. It is the last in this collection. It has very little direct Dzogchen content. It mostly concerns methods practitioners need, such as rites for dealing with obstacles from nāgas and so on, rites for guiding the dead through the bardo, details of empowerment rites, etc. It is very interesting for these reasons. 

The Sound Tantra, which is the root tantra of all Dzogchen teachings, is the next longest after that. Then the Invincible Lion, String of Pearls, etc.

And alternate translation gives:

and meditate the excellent mudra, the progenitor of the supreme victor, the cause of full awakening
untainted, unchanging, the one who destroys the darkness, equal with space, all pervasive, traversed by the yogi. 
The brilliant gnosis that resides in the body should be known to be the wheel of time that robs the misdeeds of existence.

You don’t need this. Your interest in the teachings is refuge. There was no ritual of taking refuge during the time of the Buddha. That ritual came later.

The principle of refuge is that you recognize that the three jewels are your sole refuge. If you have this idea, then you don’t need a ritual. Also in Mahayana, you can take refuge by visualizing all Buddhas and bodhisattvas in front of you and reciting the formula of refuge. That is sufficient.

Because anuyoga regards ati as a result. So your assertion, “if the view is ati, then everything is ati” is not correct. There is also no creation or completion stage in Dzogchen.

Content:
I stand corrected. I was unaware that the so-called Brahamajala Precept sūtra was this Chos kyi rgya mo. We have the Hinayāna Brahmajala sūtra in translation as well. 

The title is Chos kyi rgya mo , which means roughly "Seal of the Dharma" (Chos kyi rgyal mo means Queen of Dharma). The Dege edition lists it as a translation from Chinese, with the legend, "translated from Chinese, edited according to the new dharma terminology." It is found in the Phangthangma catalogue. 

It begins a little after the second fascicle of the Chinese text begins.

So, even though a portion of this text was translated into Tibetan, we really don't read this text. For example. the Fourth Shamar notes it is a dubious text specifically because of this passage:

"[H]e himself was named Siddhārtha. He left home at the age of seven; he attained enlightenment at thirty and came to be called Śākyamuni Buddha." 

Pg. 40, BDK edition. 

So, in general, we don't give it any credit.

One, while in general the Coughlin translation is pretty good, it is not without its faults, bracketing [false] before views is misleading. 

Two, pacifying proliferation (prapañcopaśamaṃ) and abandonment of all views (sarvadṛṣṭiprahāṇāya) are equivalent. 

But there is no thesis here to defend, no affirming negation, if you will. There is here no negation of view to replace it with some other view. 

If you want to get into the head of Nāgārjuna regarding the limits of holding a thesis (pratijñā), you should look at Westerhoff's study and translation of the Vaidalyaprakaṇa. It is a detailed refutation of the Nyāya's sixteen categories (padārtha). You should also look a the Vigrahavyavartani, also translated by Westerhoff.

There are two kinds of delusion, clyde. Delusion concerning the nature of things (for example, believing in svabhāva, self, and so on) and delusion concerning the aspect of things (two moons in the sky). Most of us do not suffer from the latter. All of us suffer from the former.

Not if you are unable to identify who is saying what to whom in the text, for example, Kalupahana’s stillbirth of a translation utterly misconstrues nearly all of MMK because he tried to understand the text without relying on Buddhapalita. You have also misconstrued exactly the same points he did. Therefore, read Buddhapalita and get back to me. You will thank me.

There are some differences in pedagogy, but there is no real evolution in Madhyamaka thought. How could there be? Mādhyamīkas do not make propositions concerning the ultimate. They did respond to the assertions of others, and where there is disagreement among Mādhyamikas, it is disagreement over pedagogy alone, how to respond to the assertions of other buddhists and nonbuddhists.

Well,  until you subject it to analysis, you won't know, will you? Since all cause and condition is determined by Nāgārjuna to be mere convention, statements like this, "any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality" are subject to the analysis of one vs. many. As Śantirakṣita points out:

Because these entities asserted by ourselves (buddhists) and others (nonbuddhists) 
are in reality free from a nature 
of being one or many, 
they lack inherent existence, like a reflection.

This equally to proposed entities such as as a "total nexus of reality." You can say a car is a nexus of parts, but in reality you will not find a car in its parts, separate from its parts, nor in all of its part together. This claim above is the same: you can call all phenomena together reality, but you will not find reality in any one phenomena, separated from phenomena, or in all phenomena together. You will also be unable to find any phenomena which can support the existence of any other phenomena either alone or in concert. For example, a car cannot be supported on any of the phenomena which we assemble into a car, a car is merely conventional designation for a collection of parts which does not indicate anything real. As Nāgārjuna famously stated, "whatever arises in dependence, that is empty, that is dependently designated, and that is the middle way."

Not so. One cannot refute a person who has no thesis of their own. Nagarjuna’s sole concern is to point out deviations from dependent origination. Thus is why in the beginning of his text, he outlines three main theses of his opponents to take down: arising from self, from other, and without cause, having declared that dependent origination pacifies proliferation about cessation, arising, and so on.

It doesn’t depend at all on which western philosopher one asks. 

Every position refuted by Nagarjuna is a historical position held by one of his contemporaries, and no, you are incorrect, he rejected the assertions of others by pointing out the unintended consequences in their theses. There is no law requiring that erroneous assertions and arguments be given a “fair shake.” 

Since all assertions depend on assertions of the existence and nonexistence of something, Nagarjuna shows two things: 1) the Buddha spoke intentionally of existence and nonexistence depending on the audience. 2) he reaffirmed the Buddha’s own observations that dependent origination was free of the extremes of existence and nonexistence in the face of mounting misunderstanding of the Buddha’s intent. That’s it.

Title: Re: Lojong - Offering to the Döns

This is a post I wrote some time ago, slightly corrected. 

The very simplest method is the practice of the Pretamukha-agnijvālayaśarakāra-nāma-dhāraṇī:

Early in the day, but also at any other time: into a pure vessel which is completely clean without any remnents of any food at all, place water, and holding this in one's right hand recite the following dharani seven times:

Namaḥ sarvatathāgata avalokite oṃ saṃbhara saṃbhara hūṃ

Then recite the names of these Buddhas:

Homage to the Tathāgata Many Jewels [imagine all the pretas actions of avarice of many lifetimes are destroyed and they accumulate all merits].

Homage to the Tathāgata Sublime Form [Imagine all the pretas physical sufferings are conquered and they acheive perfect forms and characteristics].

Homage to the Tathāgata Endlessly Abundant Body [Imagine all the pretas thirst is given up and satisfied, and they are satisified with sufficient food].

Homage to the Tathāgata Free from Fear [Imagine all the pretas are free from all fears].

At the end of reciting these names, snap one's fingers three times, and pour the vessel's contents out onto clean ground. 

Having done this, one will have pacified the realms of the pretas, and satisfied them, and so on.

This instruction on how to do the practice is extracted from the root text found in volume Wam of the bstan 'gyur. 

This practice is very powerful in removing provocations by non-human beings, is an extremely rapid way of reaching the end of the perfection of generosity, and so on. It requires no initiation of any kind. You can also skip reciting the Buddhas names.

The Bhagavat said, “Āditya and Candra came from his eyes, Maheśvara came from his forehead, Brahmā came from his shoulders, Nārāyaṇa came from his heart, Devi Sarasvatī came from his canines, Vāyu came from his mouth, Dharaṇī came from his feet, and Varuṇa came from his stomach.

“When those deities had come from Avalokiteśvara’s body, that bhagavat told the deity Maheśvara, ‘Maheśvara, in the kaliyuga, when beings have bad natures, you will be declared to be the primal deity who is the creator, the maker. All those beings will be excluded from the path to enlightenment. They will say to ordinary beings:

“ ‘It is said: the sky is his liṅga,
The earth is his seat.
He is the foundation of all beings.
The liṅga is so called because they dissolve into it.

https://read.84000.co/translation/UT220 ... 051-004-67

The Sanskrit manuscript provided as an appendix lists the term ādibuddha 8 times, sometimes in the phrase ādibuddhaiḥ pracoditā, Was taught by the buddhas from the earliest times. And sometimes in the plural, ādibuddhair, primordial buddhas. But it is never used in this text in sense of adibuddha in the Namasamgīti, and later texts. So, the Namasaṃgīti wins.

According to one of my Tibetan Medicine teachers, Menpa Tingzin, sang, in general, comes from the ancient Tibetan nomadic custom of burning juniper by the tent door when visitors come in order to disinfect them, because juniper is antimicrobial.

As for your first question, no. 

There is explanation, but you need to receive the teaching. 

Karmamudra practice in this system is associated with the Yab, Cakrasamvara, but not the yum, Vajrayogini. It is explained that karmamudra is not necessary for the realization of mahamudra in Yogini practice. This is probably based on the Kalacakra's rejection of karmamudra as well.

We have the evidence of when they were translated into Tibetan and Chinese, and evidence of their development over time. 

Susiddhikara-mahātantra-sādhanopāyika-paṭala was translated into Chinese in 726. The  Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṁgraha in 756. The  Mañjuśrīmulakalpa appeared in Chinese (983), and a bit later in Tibetan (1040+-). AFIK, the Nāmasaṃgīti was never translated into Chinese untl quite late, The version now in the Tibetan Kengyur was translated into Tibetan by RInchen Zangpo, but there exists a commentary attributed Vimalamitra with all the root verses, in a translation attributed to Nyak Jñānakumara. Davidson thinks it may have been composed around 700 CE. It is a work listed in the Ldan dkar catalogue. There is a Snying ma rgyud 'bum translation that differs from the one in the Kengyur. It is also found in Dunhuang. Anthony Tribe summarizes the scholarship on Namasaṃgīti here:

https://www.academia.edu/34621199/_Mañj ... Brill_2015.

In any case, I would elect this as the likely source of the term "adibuddha."

No, actually, it isn't written there at all. The term does not exist in this sūtra or any other. 

The term adhibuddha (dang po'i sangs rgyas) either originates from the Mañjuśrīmulakalpa or the Namasaṃgiti, depending on which text one thinks was set down first. 

Samantabhadra, to answer the OP's question, first shows up as a name for the dharmakāya in the Sarvatathāgatatattvasamgraha Tantra. Vajrasattva also first appears in this tantra. 

Vajradhara first appears in the Susiddhikara-mahātantra-sādhanopāyika-paṭala, the root kriya tantra.

Maybe in Chinese texts. I wouldn't know, as I have no skill in Chinese.  

There is a bit of slippage in Tibetan texts between luminosity ('od gsal) and clarity (gsal ba), sometimes translated as cognizance. Generally the nature of the mind has three characteristics: it is empty, it is clear, and it is knowing. These characteristics are irreducible. They are also inseparable. "Clarity" in this context means that mind can receive impressions from objects without actually being affected by those impressions, like the surface of a mirror.

No. 

It is basically a older version of five element calculation that comes from China. Rather than being based on the Indian elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space, it is based on the five phases of the Chinese system: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, and the mother/son/enemy/friend relationship between these five. These five are mapped over the cycle of twelve years, beginning with the rat year and entering with the ox year, making for a sixty year cycle. Also the months, days, and hours are similarly divided. It also includes the magic square of saturn (mewa), and the eight trigrams, called parkha in Tibetan in its calculations. 

It is used as a kind of almanac, a general way of knowing what are good days and bad, and so on, whether a year has a positive outlook for one or negative, and if negative, what kind of rites one needs to use to repel them. It has a broad use in Tibetan culture. 

Myth has it that it was taught by Manjushri to Confucius, and it was then brought to Tibet. Like the I ching trigams and hexagrams, a tortoise figures largely in its origins. The various legends it has about the origins of the trigrams, etc., and the cosmic tortoise itself are very entertaining. 

But no one believes it trumps karma.

You need to have empowerment for all. There are no exceptions.

You need to understand this point: all tantric teachings are connected with transmission. Without transmission it is like trying to use an appliance without electricity. If you have received an anuttarayoga tantra empowerment, you are then permitted to read tantras. But even then, you should only do so under the guidance of a teacher. This is the tradition. Of course, no one can see what you do in your house. But this is the proper way. 

To read Dzogchen texts you need Dzogchen empowerments. General anuttara empowerments like Hevajra, etc., are not sufficient because the path is different.

A commentary on the Soaring Garuda, one of the five lungs brought to Tibet by Vairocana:

In order to demonstrate the deviations of the stages:

Even relying on the tenth bhumi is an obstruction to awakening. 

Seeking that relies on the path method of the tenth bhumi of the causal bodhisattvas and the wish to attain by relying on the tenth stage of outer, inner and secret secret mantra are unable to see the place that is free from being traversed. 

The extremely rapid wisdom is free from all thoughts.

That being the case, because the self-originated wisdom, the basis of everything, is free from gradual progression, it is more rapid because of emphasizing nonprogression through mere seeing. Since that is free from all goal-oriented apprehension of objects and apprehending subjects, it is very special because there is no obscuration to purify.

Three fetters they have utterly forsworn.

Alan Wallace might make that assertion, but I prefer to follow Garb Dorje comments on this passage from The Great Space of Vajrasattva:

The path of higher and higher purification 
is not consistent with the Dharma that is free of activity. 

Merit and wisdom are accumulated with thoughts that arise from the worldly. Objectives of traversing somewhere—gradual progress, the stages of bodhi, the abodes of Brahma and Indra, the universal emperor, and so on—are the path of affliction, and are bondage. Free from all activity, totally peaceful like space, bliss that is totally uniform and beyond limits, the natural great perfection cannot be thought, practiced, nor mediated. It does not depend on another by nature. For example, like the great king of wishfulfilling gems, it has the power to grant all treasures, whether Dharma or not Dharma.

If there were traversing a path, 
nothing would attained, like the boundary of space. 

Also, the meaning commentary on the Cuckoo of Vidyā in the Bairo 'Gyud 'bum addresses the part of the title "single stage"

Since the suffering of effort is pacified because there is no progression in stages, there is the refreshment of great final solace without depending on arriving [somewhere]. 

As such, Dzogchen should be understood as an ekabhumi teaching.

That is just not how it is seen in the Tibetan tradition. At no point in any Tibetan commentary is such an indication made. My point is that this distinction that strictly differentiates one's personal effort and Amitabha's aspiration is not made in Tibetan Buddhism, in fact, it is the opposite; they are mutual, without personal effort through generating bodhicitta and so on, Amitabha's aspiration is not effective for that person. It's quite clear in the text of the sūtra as we read it. YMMV.

I understand how these distinctions are made in JSS, and I am not arguing with them about their understanding. 

However, it is not germane to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. If we want to understand this from the Tibetan Buddhist point of view, we have to exclude imputing Jodo Shinshu, etc. interpretations, otherwise, we will not understand what Tibetan commentaries actually intend——and this is the main fault of the Halkias book and Cook paper. 

The Tibetan version of the Sutra requires that sentient beings first must have generated Mahāyāna bodhicitta. Those who have not generated bodhicitta are necessarily excluded. Actually, conditions 18 and 19 are barely distinguishable, to the point where 19 is basically an elaboration of 18. For this reason, we see Tibetans selecting condition 19, with its four conditions as the critical point.

No. That is not possible. If it were possible, then there would be no sentient being who had heard Amitabha's name and ignored it. Why? Because presumably Amitabha's compassion would not permit it. But buddhas are not omnipotent. They do not have the power to change the karma of sentient beings by fiat, nor to plant thoughts in their minds. If they did, the consequence would be that since there is still suffering, buddhas would be incomparably cruel for not motivating all sentient beings to attain buddhahood by taking birth in Sukhavati. The inspiration for taking birth in Sukhavati necessarily depends on a sentient being's own karma and aspirations (smon lam).

You read the rest on your own for which you have received the lung. If you have questions, you go back and ask. Wallace is not completely wrong, but he has left out an essential part of the process.

Mahayana streamentry means one has directly realized two-fold emptiness. 

There are no observable external signs of such an attainment. So in this case, one would have to just take GG’s word at face value. 

I mean, that would be like me publicly claiming that I’ve been told by some lama I won’t experience the bardo. Anyone would be quite justified in expressing their skepticism of such a claim.

Correct, but that condition is not possible without all the rest, they are all integral to one another, just as it is integral to all of them.  Since Dharmakara has done his job, presumably, without our participation the other 47 conditions fail. The crucial point of course is that it’s our faith, through hearing Amitabha’s name, upon which  Dharmakara depends for the success of his aspiration. Without us, he has no buddhafield.

My point related to how the term is understood in Tibetan, and we can’t simply gloss over it. The point I am making, which is being astutely ignored here, is that Dharmakara didn’t make 48 aspirations. He made one. His aspiration was to purify a buddhafield, and he specified 48 conditions integral to his success in doing so. I am maintaining that distinction is critical in understanding why the Tibetan pure land traditions are quite uniform in their presentation from the eighth century onward.

I was using a native Tibetan dictionary. The Valby dictionary is not reliable, it’s kind of like a pastiche of different translators. It’s not reflective of how Tibetans understand their own terminology at all. The native Tibetan etymology is as I explained it to you. No Tibetan considers a smon lam to be a sdom pa. As I said, there is a semantic disconnect here.

Maybe in Chinese, not in Tibetan. In Tibetan pranidhana is translated as smon lam. Smon pa refers to a desire to attain something, lam refers to an utterance (tshig gi lam, literally path of words), hence we typically translate this term as “aspiration.” So there is a disconnect here based on semantics.

Then stop calling the 48 parts of the aspiration of Dharmakāra "vows." They do not satisfy the requirement of a vow (samvara) from the pov of the Tibetan tradition. 

If you continue to call these things vows, you won't understand pure land practice from the Tibetan Buddhist pov. You need to set aside your frame.

Tulku Orgyen has said that all Yanas have some aspect of trekchod in their teachings. The term original purity is not unique to Dzogchen, it’s found in the PP sutras, etc. 

So it is not surprising Meido would see some similarities between Dzogchen and Rinzai Zen in his later training. 

 But I don’t think one can just say Dzogchen and Zen are commensurate, there are important differences, not least of which is that Dzogchen is situated in a dialectic with the Path of Transformation in Vajrayana, whereas Chan/Zen/Son are situated in a dialectic with Sutric Buddhism, while largely accepting the path of renunciation advocated in Sutra as a basis for conduct, particularly in Chan and Son. 

Similarities include, as noted above, teacher/student interaction that privileges oral instruction over scripture and rejection of path-based ranking schemes of realization.

A striking difference I perceive between Chan/Son/Zen is the extent to which Chan, etc., is deeply entwined with institutional practice, whereas Dzogchen practice is fundamentally a solo endeavor, carried out alone and in solitude. Of course I don’t mean to suggest there is no solo Chan/zen meditation practice, because of course there is. But group meditation practice, while not completely foreign to Dzogchen, especially in an instructional context, is not the general mode of practice. There are no Dzogchendos.

Right, without the ring of faith, there is nothing for the hook of compassion to catch. But this is beside the point. The point I keep making is that Pure Landers are inclined to focus on thus or that part of Amitabha”s aspiration. We aren’t. 

As for accepting or rejecting sutras, if a sutra isn’t in the Tibetan Canon, we don’t read it, or reference it commentarially. You might regard this as short-sighted, but it isn’t. It’s just how our tradition evolved. Your’s evolved differently. That’s totally ok.

There are important differences. I would never, for example, assert expertise in Zen, claim to be able to explain koans, etc., or argue that shikantaza and trekcho are the same thing, though it is tempting to draw similarities. I would be suspicious of any Zen teacher who claimed they could explain Dzogchen unless they knew Tibetan, etc. 

But as JD astutely observed, my initial response was one of discomfort with the responses reported by Dosho Port. It all seemed just a little pat to me. Slogans like "OMG, I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together." Plus I really think that "nonduality" is an overused meme in Western "Eastern" spirituality, and when taken out of context is completely meaningless.

I personally think the main defect of the Halkias book is confirmation bias.

I don't have a problem with it per se, it just isn't how things are framed in a Tibetan Buddhist context. There is no commentarial analysis of these 48 points of Dharmakāra Bodhisattva's aspiration, for example. No distinctions are made between the 18th, 19th, and 20th point, no moḳsology connected with the kind of faith Zhen Li discusses——which isn't even one's own faith, properly speaking, but more of a pure trust in the efficacy of Dharmakāra's aspiration to do all the heavy lifting. This kind of idea is simply not present in the Tibetan Buddhist culture sphere. 

The faith of simple people in Tibet is to recite the mani as much as possible, spinning prayer wheels all the while, and hope to be born in the Sukhavati after death, guided through the bardo there by a qualified lama. That's about it. When one does transference of consciousness, the form may be Amitabha, but the essence is one's guru. All phowas with three thoughts, a consciousness to transfer, a place to transfer, and the action are predicated on one transferring one's consciousness into the heart of one's guru visualized as Amitabha, Vajrasattva, etc. It is just an entirely different religious culture than Chinese or Japanese Pure Land Buddhism.

What I am saying is that at one level, it doesn't matter what this old master said or that one. What matters is gaining personal experience in the path. That can only happen if one actually make a commitment and actually practices the path. It is useless to sit around and compare realizations. We can only have our own realization and no one else's. No one can actually confirm our realization for us, in fact, not even the Buddha. That's why every teacher tells their students, "Great, you understood something, keep up the good work" if the student is sincere. Acknowledgement of a student by a teacher is far more about the student's sincerity than confirming that someone has achieved this or that rank. 

For example, in Dzogchen teachings, there is only one level, rhetorically speaking. Where other teachings such as Vajrayāna, Lotus Buddhism, Shingon, etc., are ekayāna teachings, Dzogchen is an ekabhumi teaching. Zen is a little similar, according to my understanding. In Dzogchen, you learn to recognize your own state after it has been introduced; you work on removing doubt about that state; and then, when you have resolved your doubts, you continue in that state. But these are just words. The rubber has got to meet the road, otherwise it is all just rhetorical posturing.

There is no such contradiction. The Sanskrit and Tibetan recensions do not guarantee immediate birth for those of the third grade. Only the Chinese version does.

The measure of progress in Dharma: are your three poisons under control? Are you a more loving and compassionate person?  Are you more patient, relaxed, and easy going? Are you wiser when viewing cause and effect? Do you have some understanding of emptiness and dependent origination? If the answer is yes to all of these questions, then you are doing pretty good job as a practitioner. In this case it does matter whether you practice Zen, Vipassana, Dzogchen, Pure Land, Nichiren Buddhism, Vajrayāna, and so on. 

The awakening or enlightenment of other people is not transferrable. All teachers can do us is show us a path. As long as they understand the path they are practicing, have some core competencies in the literature of their tradition, as well as some kind of lineage transmission, then they can teach to interested people. If they happen to be awakened, great. But there is no special sign that someone is an ārya bodhisattva, they don't carry signs. One can only know a bodhisattva through their extraordinary compassion. 

In the lower stages, bodhisattvas don't remember their training in past lives and will not possess the realization they had in previous lives. They practice the path and realize it again. This is why the lower bodhisattva stages are stages of retrogression. When one passes away, even if one reached the sixth bodhisattva stage, one will forget it in the next life until one meets the dharma again, whenever that is, in a future life. To be a Mahāyāna bodhisattva requires great courage and the commitment to practice the path to the end. There are many time where we will take rebirth where there will be no dharma for us to meet, no teachers to meet, no sangha to have.

If Buddhism depended on enlightened teachers these days, it would have already been extinguished. 

The very first Buddhist teacher I ever encountered was on a weekend field trip to go sit with Eido Shimano in 1978 at Dai Bosatsu Zendo. I was sixteen, and I thought for sure that this guy must be enlightened. When I heard about the drunken sprawl that constituted a weekend field trip sit with Trungpa at Tail of Tiger, I was pretty smug, since I was very impressed with Dai Bosatsu (I was't permitted to go because I was delinquent in my homework).  

At Dai Bosatsu, I remember chanting the Heart Sutra in Japanese, but of course I could not keep up. And I remember being hit with a stick, which at that place you had to request. I wanted to see what it felt like.  Of course I never received a Koan, etc., because I never went back there. But I always felt a kinship with the Japanese Zen tradition in general. When I went to Japan, a monk from Koyasan who spoke English asked me what kind of Buddhist I was, since I self-identified as a Buddhist, and I told him I was a Rinzai Buddhist. Of course, I did not know what I was talking about, but because I had that weekend experience at a nominally Rinzai place, that's what I said. (A funny aside, some of the kids brought valium to make it through the sitting periods, but I toughed it out). 

Imagine my disappointment when, thirty-two years later, I heard he had been a serial womanizer, and that Robert Aitken had been keeping a record of his indiscretions for decades. The scandal went so deep that Myōshin-ji rejected the qualifications of all people that Shimano had designated as successors.

Now, many of the major Zen Buddhist founding teachers and their students in the US of note have been implicated in some kind of impropriety with women, financial impropriety, etc. some even claiming their bodhisattva activity justified their behavior. We all know who they are, no need to rehash the details . Many major Tibetan Buddhists like Trungpa, etc., were all deeply involved sex scandals, drug addiction, alcoholism, etc. Not just in the Kagyu school, but in Nyingma, Gelug, and so on. Even here we run into people who assert Trungpa was enlightened because x or y said so. I don't believe it. 

I generally do not believe students of teachers when they assure me their guru or roshi or sensei or geshe or tulku is a highly realized being. I certainly don't believe it when a guru or roshi or sensei or geshe or tulku declares they are a highly realized being. 

If someone passes, and they shows signs and relics at the time of their death, maybe I will believe it. But also signs and relics can just be the play of the four elements, and illustrate nothing special at all, so maybe I won't. Also nonbuddhist yogis sometimes sit for days without their bodies showing signs of decay, which demonstrates nothing more than function of mundane samādhis and nothing about awakening, bodhi. 

All I know is that studying and practicing Dharma has brought meaning and purpose to my life. But claims of realization by Buddhist teachers and for Buddhist teachers? Meh. You can keep 'em. I am not buying.

Yes. In Tibetan Buddhism, the practice is designed on the basis of the first grade of practitioners. So if some one is serious about being in the best or second best kind of birth, they know what to do.  

Apart from  irmanakaya phowa, the other two do do not involve birth in Sukhavati.
In particular lamas train in nirmanakaya phowa mainly to help others. Also when train, you need to have the sign of phowa to assist others, and as proof you yourself will succeed if you can do it at the time death.

Expressing an opinion is not slander. What is slander? "The action or crime of making a false spoken statement damaging to a person's reputation."

Now, my statement is not false. How could it be? I merely expressed an opinion, one you don't like. But that's your problem of attachment, not mine. You are certainly entitled to think my opinion is wrong, misguided, deluded, shameful, and any number of terrible things. But it isn't a false statement, since it's my opinion and I stated it directly and honestly. 

But I certainly have not ruined anyone's reputation, either, and I don't answer to you, clyde. So get over yourself. 

Now, this little exchange has become a meta-conversation and is therefore, out of TOS.

One other thing-- if Guo Gu was a first stage bodhisattva, do you think he would care? Of course not, so get over it. This is solely your problem.

In our tradition, Dharmakāra only makes one aspiration. It may have forty-eight parts, but they are integral to a single aspiration. One can argue over which passage is more important, but actually, it's just one aspiration.

Sure, one might argue that the 18th part is the most important because of the gatha that says:

If any sentient being hears my name,
they will be born in my buddhafield. 

But this is nothing I have ever seen any Tibetan scholar advance as a special position, Mipham included.

The dhyāna being discussed is not the dhyāna discussed in Dzogchen teachings. The latter does not depend on mental factors, unlike the former. So the answer is a solid no. In fact, it is the opposite. Rig pa (knowledge of one's own state)  brings about natural concentration (rang bzhin bsam gtan), which is unlike the dhyānas spoken of in the lower yānas. Longchenpa writes about this extensively.

So do you agree or disagree with Shohaku Okumura:

Some people think mind to be permanent and body to be impermanent. In this case, mind was considered to be atman; that is, pure and permanent. And the body was considered to be the source of delusive desire and impermanent. In this case, mind was called shinsho (mind nature) and body was called shinso (bodily form). And this mind-nature was often used as a synonym of buddha-nature. This is the reason Dogen negates the idea of kensho (seeing the nature).

Dosho Port's article, for me, is describing are what are classified as experiences: Tib. nyams su myong ba, Skt. anubhava.

Re: Meido’s definition, it’s  the entrance to authentic mahamudra and Dzogchen practice as well. But we don’t call this “awakening” or even “realization.” It’s just a recognition. 

And, as I understand things, Dogen didn’t like the term “kensho” because it implied an imperishable mind as opposed to a perishable body.

If you can manage to get your act together. Sukhavati phowa is enormously unreliable in this regard.  Case in point: there was a famous phowa master in Dedham Dun, who successfully performed phowa often for other people. However, when it came time for this master to perform phowa for himself, he was unable to do so.  He died before His Holiness Sakya Trichen was able to perform it for him. 

There are many forms of phowa. Some involve Sukhavati, but not all. Sukhavati phowas are considered nirmanakaya phowas, because they involve a subject, an object, and an action. There are also sambhogakaya phowas and dharmakaya phowas. These later two have nothing to do with birth in Sukhavati, and instead refer to attaining buddhahood in bardo or at the time of death. Phowa is a rich tradition, which encompasses many approaches.

The only difference between the samādhi of watching TV and the training of samādhi in the Dharma is that the former is contaminated, and the latter is not. But the samādhi, the mental factor, is identical in both cases, only the object is different. What makes the samādhi part hard is that it is difficult to shift one's focus from mundane contaminated objects to mundane uncontaminated objects, such as the path dharmas. Hence, the need for śila as a basis for samādhi. But this has nothing actually to do with samādhi itself. Samādhi can be focused wherever one likes. And in the case of a practitioners, that concentration is focused on Dharma. It also has nothing developing rarified samadhis, etc. Samādhi here just means being able to focus the mind at will. Thats it. People keep turning these things into strange beasts. We avoid things that disturb our minds (śila), so that we can focus (samādhi) on developing the three wisdoms. That's it. It's not complicated. 

Its better to understand the essence of a thing, rather than pile elaboration on top of elaboration.

I have no problem with the idea of waking up in this life (Dzogchen, check; Zen, check), a teaching outside of the sutras ( (Dzogchen, check; Zen, check), based on following a qualified teacher (Dzogchen, check; Zen, check). 

I merely question the promiscuous use of the term "bodhi" to describe what appear to me to be training experiences. 

Presumably, we are all trying to realize the same reality, no? the same absence of self, the same emptiness of dharmas and persons?

Bodhi, waking up, means realizing emptiness, not intellectually, but in actuality. It's inexpressible, so how can it be expressed in words? 

This is why, when I see such articles like these in Trike, etc., it makes me skeptical. I don't doubt that Dosho Port is writing this in good faith. I am just skeptical. 

Have these people even achieved patience towards their own afflictions? Are they still gripped by the three poisons? If they are, then they have not realized emptiness at all, but merely had an training experience that approximates emptiness. It's a good experience, a positive working basis for bodhi, but it isn't awakening, bodhi. It's like someone who opens their eyes for moment before waking up in the morning and then falls back into the early morning dream they were having.  YMMV.

If someone has actually realized emptiness and woken up, they don't need anyone to confirm it for them. If on the other hand, they have a bit of doubt, and are not sure they have understood the meaning of emptiness, they might need a little push from a teacher to direct them in the proper way.

No, if you examine carefully, all four characteristics discussed in the commentaries are present in this short practice. The Amitabha mantra (Amideva is a Tibetan corruption of Amitabha) is there for focus. There is a supplication. There is dedication. Prostration as an expression of faith.

Prajñā is not acquired through samādhi at all. However, śila provides a basis for a focused mind (samādhi), and a focused mind provides a basis for prajñā. 

Prajñā is acquired through hearing (śrutimayāprajñā), reflection (cintamayāprajñā), and cultivation (bhāvanamayīprajñā). 

The dhyānas are not required for this at all. Samādhi is just mental one-pointedness on a object. For most people, that would be TV, these days.
