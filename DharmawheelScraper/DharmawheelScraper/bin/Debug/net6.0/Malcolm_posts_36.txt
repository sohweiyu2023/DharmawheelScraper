Yes, just as emptiness is a quality: that is what the generic basis is, a set of qualities which inhere to all sentient beings. 

It is not really that complicated. We say that minds are empty and luminous. When we analyze a given mind (for example, our own, since we cannot examine the minds of others), all we can discover is emptiness and luminosity. These are the irreducible facts that pertain to minds. The fact that minds are empty means they are free from extremes and not monadic, or even plural entities. The fact that they are luminous means that they are not inert, like rocks, etc. We don't need to discuss these things in terms of the two truths, because there is no separation between the two truths anyway.

If it were, it would not be empty. It is for this reason that it is an error to say that the generic basis is only a naturally perfected (lhun grub, anabhogana) nature (rang bzhin, prakriti). If this were the case, Dzogchen would be Samkhya, basically.

Luminosity does not have a basis, per se. It is empty. This is the reason the generic basis is described as being originally pure and naturally perfected i.e. so called ka dag chen chen po, great original purity. All minds have these qualities.

Nāgārjuna was not pointing to anything in MMK. If you want to understand what Nāgārjuna was pointing to, you need to read the Praise to the Inconceivable (Acintyastava):

One who asserts dualities in pristine consciousness
such as birth and death, 
coming and going,
or bondage and liberation, 
does not know reality. 
There is no arising from anywhere,
that is what nirvana is;
because of being similar to an illusory elephant, 
in reality,  peaceful from the start. 
Even arising does not arise, 
held to be just like an illusory elephant. 
In the same way too everything arises,

There is no universal basis, as such. There is however a generic basis, which has three characteristics: essence, nature and compassion. Just as all instances of water are generically limpid, clear and moist, likewise the basis for each and every sentient being is the trio of essence, nature and compassion. Put in the simplest terms, all sentient beings possess a consciousness which has the nature being empty and clear. When examined from the point of view of reducing this to the most essential point, the basis is just one's unfabricated mind, nothing more, nothing less. 

The all-basis is of course the imputing ignorance.

For example, the Chinese original text where it literally reads Bodhidharma faced a wall for 9 years, in the Tibetan translation of the same passage, the passage reads "faced reality." In explaining Chan to Tibetans, Chinese Chan masters often had to depoetacize their texts to make them understandable to Tibetans. Studying Chan texts in Tibetan translation is illuminating because of the (invisible) oral commentary that was required to make often multivalent passages in Chinese comprehensible to non-Chinese speakers, and it gives us a sense of use of how colloquial passages that are hard to understand were understood at that time. 

I suggest you pick up a copy of Tibetan Zen.

My friend, I can assure you that is indeed the case that rig pa becomes ma rig pa. And why? Because vāyu stirred consciousness and that consciousness that does not recognize its own display is ma rig pa. As it states in my forthcoming translation (Wisdom, 12/16) of one of the most seminal of all Dzogchen commentaries:

As such, knowledge (vidyā, rig pa) itself becomes ignorance (ma rig pa, āvidyā) and nondelusion becomes delusion. 

And how does this happen?

The trio of the essence, nature, and compassion of the original basis becomes the three ignorances. Since the essence is made the cause of delusion, it is designated “the ignorance of the same identity” and becomes so. Once the nature is made the condition of delusion, since the vāyu of the impelling karma manifests as color, it is designated “the connate ignorance” and becomes so. Compassion is made the result of delusion. Since pristine consciousness manifests as different names, that is designated as “the imputing ignorance” and becomes so. As such, from not recognizing that knowledge and ignorance have the same cause, like the front and back of one’s hand, the ignorance of the same identical cause arises from not arriving at ultimate nonduality. The connate ignorance (arising from the preceding) is a term of duality, meaning as soon as the conceit “this is originally pure” occurs, it is inseparable from that ignorance. Thus, ignorance depends on knowledge and delusion depends on nondelusion. 

And as Vimalamitra states:

The vidyā that is moved and stirred by vāyu
is subtle; its stirring is difficult to understand. 


You might wish to reconsider your point of view in this light.

Nope. All Bhavaviveka says is that in the refutation of an opponent's position, a consequence is insufficient to convince them of emptiness. They must be shown that emptiness is provable through a formal syllogism which destroys their position. Candrakirti disagrees, and asserts that a mere consequence is sufficient. 

There are other things for which Candrakirtī (and later Tsongkhapa and many others) criticize Bhavaviveka, but they are inconsequential to his main point.

In other words, Tsongkhapa's Svatantra is not represented by Bhavaviveka. His Svatantra is just as idealized a school as his Prasanga. Neither idealized position exists in Indian Madhyamaka in the manner in which Tibetans since the 12th century have presented it.

It has taken some time for scholarly consensus to grapple with this, but it has gradually come around. In brief, Tsongkhapa's Madhyamaka is his own. Brilliant, unique, and scholarly, but it is not a Madhyamaka that is recognizable in any Indian school. In fact it represents a rapprochement of Madhyamaka dialects with a species of Buddhist logic invented in Tibet by Phyapa at Sangphu (a famous opponent of Candra and the formulator of the system of logic employed in Gelugpa).

If you assert, as you are, that a valid cognizer depends on a valid object, and that a valid object depends on a valid cognition, the consequence of this is two fold: a valid object will always be valid, irregardless of whether it is cognized or not, because it determines whether or not the cognition that perceives it is valid or not. A valid cognizer will always be valid irrespective of whether it's object is delusive or nondelusive because its validity is what makes the object valid. 

For example, in a dream, appearances seem valid. We react to them as if they are valid. We only determine dream appearances to be invalid when we wake. How is waking consciousness actually different than a dream consciousnesses? Unlike a dream, we have no outside reference to judge its validity. However, our waking consciousness is merely a dream as well, and when compared with the consciousness of a Buddha, is found to be wholly invalid.

The third area of difference between Kashmir Śaivism and Vedānta concerns the essence, the substance, the basis of this universe. Vedānta holds that this universe is untrue, unreal. It does not really exist. It is only a creation of illusion (māyā). Concerning this point, Kashmir Śaivism argues that if Lord Śiva is real, than how could an unreal substance come out from something that is real? If Lord Śiva is real, then His creation is also real. Why should it be said that Lord Śiva is real and Hs creation is an illusion (māyā)? Kashmir Śaivism explains that the existence of this universe is just as real as the existence of Lord Śiva. As such, it is real, pure, and solid. This is nothing about it at all which is unreal."


-- pg. 104, Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme; 1st Books,  2000. 

In Dzogchen it is held that the appearance of the universe is caused by the imputing ignorance which is a result of the neutral awareness at the time the basis arises from the basis not recognizing its own appearances as being its own state. Needless, to say, that mind is also empty, and lacks any nature or inherent existence. That mind is also individual, which accounts for why Samantabhadra woke up at the time the basis arose from the basis, and sentient beings did not. 

In short, the foundation of Dzogchen teachings is the Buddha's teaching of the five elements, five aggregates, emptiness, dependent origination,etc.; while the foundation of Kashmir Shaivism is Samkhya, with an added eleven principles on top of Samkhya's original 25, in addition to asserting there is only one universal puruśa, Śiva, as opposed to Samkhya's assertion that there are infinite individual puruśas.

One must also learn the distinction between ignorance (ma rig pa, avidyā) and knowledge (rig pa, vidyā, usually mistranslated as "awareness" by translators of Tibetan texts.)

Herbie, there are four terms at word here at work here: svabhāva, parabhāva, bhāva and abhāva.

Nāgārjuna defines dependent or extrinsic existence (parabhāva) as a species of inherent existence (svabhāva). 

 As I pointed out to you already, bhāva (existence) is included in svabhāva. 

Nāgārjuna is saying that if you cannot prove or establish svabhāva, you cannot prove bhāva. If you cannot prove bhāva, you also cannot show abhāva, i.e., nonexistence, since abhāva is always the nonexistence of something that once existed.

arises as every diversity since her unchanging bhaga is vast. 
The whole universe is included in her bhaga. 
The bhaga of the mother is the field of great emptiness.

When you have the capacity to give away your wife and children (with their consent of course) to be the slaves of a brahmin, or your eyes to a beggar woman, then I will believe you have the understanding your words profess, and not until then.

Since in me there is no birth nor death, 
the qualities of cessation are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no inside nor outside, 
the qualities of clarity are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no emptiness or things, 
the qualities of appearances are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no object of perception, 
perceptible objects are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no body or mind, 
self-apparent qualities are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no self and other, 
the five qualities of vidyā are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no creative cause, 
total concentration is totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no place to go, 
the self-apparent domain is totally perfect. 
Since in me there are no directions or sides, 
secret vidyā is totally perfect. 
Since in me appearances do not cease, 
the three qualities of the ultimate dhātu are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no one and two, 
the qualities of the bindu are totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no darkness or light, 
the qualities of direct perception are totally perfect. 
Since in me there are neither self nor concepts, 
the qualities of emptiness are totally perfect. 
Since in me the two stains do not exist, 
the five qualities of clarity are totally perfect. 
Since in me the five kāyas appear of themselves, 
the ultimate nature of the buddhafields is totally perfect. 
Since in me there is no emanating and gathering,

sha za is a translation of piśaci. "Rakṣasas", srin po, clearly refer to memories of Indian encounters with head hunters which inhabited the islands surrounding India from New Guinea and Borneo all the way to Madagascar, and who used to dominate Śri Lanka. In fact, the language of Borneo head hunters is related to only one other language in the world, the language of Madagascar. 

The Ramayāna and the Nyingma accounts of the Taming of Rudra epics can be seen as mythological retellings of the conquest of Śri Lanka by Indians in the first millenia BCE.

You just seem to fail to understand that in the four fold negation of existence, each term had a specific target in mind, in the context of ancient Indian polemics [eternalists, nihilists, jains, and sophists of various types respectively]. If you want to understand Nāgārjuna, you have to understand that. 

Nāgārjuna himself makes it very plain that by "existence," he means "inherent existence," by asking the question:

Where will there be an existent not included 
in inherent existence or dependent existence?
If inherent existence and dependent existence exist, 
existents will be established.  
If an existent is not established
a non-existent will not established. 


Tsongkhapa's whole philosophy turns on this point.

Tsongkhapa is refuting a position no one takes. 

Let me spell it out for you again. Nāgārjuna makes the contention that existence is actually a subset of inherent existence, when it is analyzed [not before]. When existence [inherent existence] is negated, the nonexistence of that existence is negated as well [since there is nothing present to be negated]. The third term, "existent and nonexistent" is refuted because there are some who claim that in the process of arising, a given thing can be asserted to both exist and not exist at the same time. The fourth term, neither existent nor non-existent, was refuted to refute sophists. 

Since Tsongkhapa never had to deal with Jains, etc, he in effect never really saw the point of the third term, and assumed they were unnecessary double negatives. But in India, there were people who asserted both the third term and the fourth term, so it was necessary to reject all four extremes in turn.

The characteristic of the element of formations and the ultimate
is the characteristic of being free from being the same or different;
whoever conceives them as being the same or different, 
they have entered in improper view.

And the Madhyāntavibhāga states:

These two, samsara and nirvana,
arise adventitiously.

The nonconceptual equipoise on emptiness. When you are in nonconceptual equipoise on emptiness, the latent afflictions which cause rebirth in the three realms are gradually burned away.  Of course, if like some here, you do not accept rebirth, than Buddhadharma altogether just bullshit and the only possible reason you could be interested in it is for some nice relaxation meditation.

These controversies are nonissues, and they exist in Tibetan Buddhism as well, most notably in Dzogchen, where we argue that the result that does not come from a cause, buddhahood does not come from mind, and our intimate instruction does not come from a text [because it is based on direct perception]. 

The issue boils down to capacity of an individual practitioner, and no abstract theory can make someone a buddha. The real point in having these kinds of discussions is to make it clear that theories are not practice. The sudden awakening theory of Huineng is fine, but the kind of people who fully awaken in an instant are quite rare —&nbsp;as it was observed by a 12 century Dzogchen master, he looked high and low for a cig char wa, a suddenly enlightened buddha, but apart from the founder of Mahāmudra in India, Saraha, and the founder of the Drugpa Kagyu lineage, Ling Repa, he never met anyone who he could say was fully awakened, a buddha, suddenly . Such people are as rare as stars seen at noon. 

I personally have no issue with the notion of someone attaining full awakening in an instant [the doctrine the Lanka is actually famous for and the reason it should be considered the foundational document of Chan], cutting through both obscurations at once, I merely doubt that it happens very frequently, maybe as frequently as an udumbara flower blossoms. In other words Chan rhetoric is fine, but I don't think the rhetoric matches people's practice.

No, the difference between buddhas and sentient beings is the presence or absence of traces. In other words, the difference is more subtle than you admit. It is quite possible for someone to be free of grasping, but not to be free of latent afflictions [for example, someone on the path of application's level of patience.] This is why śamatha does not produce liberation. It merely suppresses the afflictions.

And forms of "marriage" are even less clear outside of the Greco-Roman sphere (to which Islam also belongs). In Tibetan for example, marriage has been mostly based on shacking up. The term for "wife" is "chung ma," "little lady." And it even so, it was really only the bdag chens, the great lords, for whom weddings were really performed. For villagers, at most it might involve inviting two families together, some recitations, smoke offerings, some dancing, and drinking.

Now then, Gelugpas are excellent scholars, and they love to debate. But their blindspot is revering Tsongkhapa so much that they deliberately ignore the many places where he directly contradicts Nāgārjuna, etc. 

The goal of a someone studying Madhyamaka should be to understand Nāgārjuna's intention, not Tsongkhapa's. You should get Ganden Chophel's book on Madhyamaka as a healthy balance to your studies of Tsongkhapa.

Inherent existence is also an imputation. Therefore, what is the difference between the two imputations, existence and inherent existence? 

It is for this reason that Nāgārjuna notes that there is no existence not included in inherent existence (svabhāva) and dependent existence (parabhāva). He then continues on to say that whoever has a view of inherent existence, dependent existence, existence, or nonexistence has not understood the meaning of the Buddha's teachings. 

The reason one negates existence is not to assert nonexistence. One negates existence in order to negate the nonexistence of an existent. This is all carefully argued in chapter 15 of the MMK. In fact, common people do not think cups and persons exist inherently, since they observe them to also cease to exist. This is why Nāgārjuna points out that "nonexistence" is the transformation of something that once was and now is not, according to common parlance.

In general, the kinds of medicines imported into Tibet from India were things that could bear portage, thus, things like triphala, etc., were imported and form an important part of Tibetan materia medica. But herbs proper could not survive the journey, and in any case, were not necessary, since the Tibetan plateau itself is astonishingly rich in wild flora. Rhodiola, for example, comes from the high Himalayas and so forth. Also the environment is purer. 

Tibetan medicine manufactured in India is often of inferior quality to that which is manufactured in Tibet. I only stock herbs imported directly from Tibet. 

And the Tibetans were not poorer by any means. Tibetans unloaded tons of gold on the Indians for the Dharma. Tibet mainly exported salt, however. 

That said, I practice a mix of Tibetan Medicine and Ayurveda, matching the treatment with the patient. But because of their superior effect and purity, I tend to favor Tibetan herbs sourced from Tibet over Ayurvedic herbs sourced from India.

I was responding to your assertion about the "limited" varieties of Tibetan herbs.

Of course, tree medicines like haritaki, bibitaki, amalaki do not grow in Tibet, as well as things like nutmeg, etc., so they are imported. 

But Tibetan herbal medicines, as well as shrubs, and trees that do not grow in India are extremely effective and plentiful. If you had actually studied Tibetan Medicine, you would know this. Now, for your information, I am a Doctor of Tibetan Medicine (Shang Shung 2009), and I am trained fully in Pañcakarma (by a doctor with a PhD in Pañcakarma in lives in South India) and other modalities, as well as Ayurvedic Herbalism as well.

It is not saying that something does not exist, it is saying that those states that we ascribe to the conditioned, arising, abiding and perishing, do not stand up to ultimate analysis. Since they do not stand up to ultimate analysis, neither does the unconditioned (space and the two kinds of cessation). 

In other words, conventional phenomena are fine as long as they are not subject to ultimate analysis (and this is something all Madhyamakas agree with). However, all phenomena, whether conditioned or conditioned, cannot bear ultimate analysis, including nirvana (cessation due to analysis). 

If you define "real" as "the ability to withstand ultimate analysis," then yes, nothing is real since nothing can bear ultimate analysis.

Yes, because a gandharva, a consciousness seeking rebirth, has entered the fertilized ovum. 

If the zygote is not viable, it will not survive implantation. But conception cannot occur without three things, as the Medical Tantra states:

First, from a man and women’s non-defective semen and blood, and a consciousness impelled by action and affliction, the five elements assemble, the cause of conception, in the womb. For example, it is equivalent with fire produced from fire sticks.

It is because the gandharva has only three indriyas when it enters the fertilized ovum, according to the The Nanda-garbhavakranti-sūtra:

Nanda, in the nineteenth week, the four organs of the fetus in the womb mother’s womb, the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the tongue fully formed. In the beginning when entering the womb initially only three faculties were attained, these being the body, life and mind.



Sensations, according to Desri Sangye Gyatso's commentary on the Medicine Tanta, occur only in the 24th week:

In the twenty-fourth month the “moving everywhere” wind clear matures the functional and  hollow organs. At that time,  also the thoughts of happiness and suffering, the objects of sensation, become known.

You are a bundle of afflictions who continually blunders through samsara because your afflictions generate actions which result in your own suffering.

What a strange interpretation you have. All the Samuccaya is saying is that a form becomes visible to oneself when it is seen by the eye. What is a form? Visible matter, i.e., form is color and shape, and also there are 20 secondary forms. Seeing something does not grant it visibility, as you suggest. Things are visible (or not) to our eyes due to the condition of light, dark, obstruction and so on. A thing must be visible, a priori, in order to be seen.

So before they are sensed, they do not exist? So in effect you are arguing that sensation produces the objects of the senses while they are being sensed. 

For you, the scent of the incense does not exist until it is smelled. 

But no, this is not the case, the five sense objects exist independently of the body as objects for the five senses, conventionally speaking. 

There can be no sight unless there is an eye, an eye consciousness, and an object of the eye (form) that come together. But the form is not something that only exists when it is seen.

It is the "whatever" that is under scrutiny here. You claim experiences are the mind, and at the same time, deny they are the mind. 

In absence of external objets, at least Yogacara posits the that appearances of subject and object arise from activated traces (vasana). You however fail to even give that much of an account. You cannot even explain the dependent origination of appearances, much less how it is that dependent origination = dharmakāya. In order for there to be dependently originated appearances, there must be conditions. But your experiences/mind just does not account for conditions at all. Your theory is incoherent.

Dependent origination does not exist apart from things, with things there is no dependent origination. 

Dharmakāya is a result of seeing the nature [dharmatā] of those things, it is the subject. As the Buddha said:

The buddhas see dharmatā, 
the guides are dharmakāya;
the latter cannot be known without 
without knowing dharmatā. 

Further, the dharmakāya is defined as unconditioned, as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra states:

The kāya of the tathagata is unconditioned. 

Now, on the other hand, dependent origination is clearly defined as conditioned, as the Ārya-karuṇāpuṇḍarīka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra

All phenomena that are called "dependently originated" are understood to be seen as conditioned. 

Thus, if you call dependent origination "dharmakāya," you are making a fundamental error in judgement which leads to dharmakāya being impermanent, etc.

Basically, the Three Visions/Three Tantras literature is one, an attempt to provide a coherent graded path, second, a system of delivering the essentials of Lamdre, which is a vast heterogeneous system, into a single text convenient to teach to a large assembly.

I did a three year retreat on Lamdre, meditating all these topics step by step, and I disagree with you as to what this passage means.

However, Tshog bshad is excessively scholastic. I prefer the earlier view of the Lamdre path as expressed by Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen. I just prefer the pre-Sakya Pandita version of Sakya Vajrayāna teachings. 

You are also neglecting the fact that the experiential vision part actually encompasses both the brief presentation of sūtra as well as Vajrayāna. The way things are explained in original Lamdre texts is very different than the Kadampaized and truncated Three Visions literature, which is quite late, actually, dating from the 14th century at the earliest, in Lama Dampa's commentaries. 

Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup was overly influenced by Kagyus (it's a fact, you can look it up), and I think this explains his gradualism to a large extent. Also his presentation of the view is felt to be somewhat hinky in some Sakyapa quarters.

Simple put, the conventions of the day generally circumscribed what "sentient" could mean. 

I don't think we can consider plants "dumb," their intelligence is as inscrutable to us as the intelligence of some alien race. But obviously Buddha placed importance on not harming plants, and we can observed this from Vinaya, among other places. 

In the end, the basic failure of these conversations derives from the traditionalist urge to argue from some perceived "authority." It's like arguing that Meru Cosmology should be accepted at face value. 

Then there is this —&nbsp;when you cut a planarian flatworm in two, it becomes two separate creatures.  If you cut it into tiny pieces, each piece will regenerate as a separate individual. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarian

Are planarians sentient beings? I think so. This then raises the question of how such consciousness that they posses individuates when a whole planarian is split into two or more viable segments. It seems that all creatures beyond the range of complexity of planarians lack this ability. 

The more we learn about the physical world, the more it causes us to pause, and take stock of many longheld Buddhist assumptions, like the one that plants are nonsentient life.

While he certainly says that by doing short sessions one gradually can remain in śamatha for twenty four hours, he certainly never makes it a precondition for moving along to vipaśyāna, or even Vajrayāna. And certainly, it is the case that that reciting the Hevajra sadhana itself is regarded as the best means of traversing the nine stages of śamatha in Lamdre, as it is described in some detail in Saroruhavajra's creation stage commentary contained within the Eight subsequent path cycles of Lamdre, which is part of the Yellow Volume. 

Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen criticizes the view that one must train excessively in sūtra before moving on the Vajrayāna practice, and this is one reason why Sakya masters tend to bestow the Hevajra empowerment right away, because they take a cig car approach based on Jetsun Rinpoche's clarification of disagreement over how best to understand the statement in the Five Stages of Nāgārjuna that, "This [Vajrayāna] is a gradual path." He asserts that sudden entry into Vajrayāna is implied by Aryadeva's amplification on this point.

I don't think you paid careful attention to the article. While the concept of autpoietic machines was indeed brought up in the original Maturana/Varela book the intent of the term is to define living systems. However, in reference to your citation about food:

Now, the next step consists of going from these very general considerations to the practical case of biological and chemical systems. Clearly, all that has just been said about cognition can be abstracted from the notion of metabolism. When an amoeba or any other living cell chooses the metabolites from the environment and rejects catabolites in it, this corresponds to a dynamic interaction that permits the enacting and the coming to being of both the living organism and the environment. Therefore, metabolism is already by itself the biological correlate of the notion of cognition. In this sense, our view is slightly different from the predicament of Bourgine and Stewart (2004), who write ‘autopoiesis focuses naturally on the internal functioning of the organism, notably its metabolism; cognition naturally thematizes the inter- actions between an organism and its environment’. We believe in fact that metabolism is not only a property of the interior of the living organism. Metabolism cannot exist permanently without (mutual) interaction with the environment. In this active interaction, the organism selects its material, and in this sense a full- blown metabolism is tantamount to cognition.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/article ... 849156.pdf

In other words, metabolism implies cognition, but machines do not choose in any sense their metabolites as opposed to their catabolites. Their consumption of "metabolites" would not be an autopoietic choice, but an allopoietic choice, a constraint imposed upon it by external programming; for example, a production line.

Therefore, the mere fact that plants are capable of metabolism implies directly that they are capable of cognition. Hence they are sentient.

There is a difference between the self-producing (autopoiesis) self-organization of living systems and static, other-produced (exopoietic) "self-organization" of inanimate things, like crystals. The latter only appear to be self-organizing, but are incapable of sustaining themselves.

So we need to add to this definition that not only are living systems self-organizing, but they are also autopoietic, self-producing.

I am making a different point. 

I can show you texts, sūtras, which mention Mt. Meru. But no one has found Mt. Meru. So this indicates that perhaps sūtras are not the infallible authority to you take them to be. I don't depend on sūtras to define my cosmology for me. Do you? Do you therefore insist that the sun and moon travel around Mt. Meru? If so, how is it that the whole world does not fall into darkness all at the same time when the Sun rounds Meru? 

Further, there is the story of Saṃgharaḳsita in the Śikṣāsammucaya which states:

Saṃgharaḳsita, those sentient beings who have turned into the forms of trees, leaves, flowers and fruits, in the past they were monks. Because they partook of the trees, leaves, flowers and fruits of the Sangha, they have turned into the form of trees, leaves, flowers and fruits

Title: Re: Dzogchen Sadhana Practice
Content:
Well, I think it is false assessment. 

Why? Because we have evidence from Mañjuśrīkīrti's Ornamenting the Essence of General Rites of All Secrets that there was a movement in India, led by Śṛī Siṅgha (mentioned by name, along with Bhikṣuni Nanda, Padmasambhava's teacher as well, and other masters), who argued that creation stage practices was taught only to reject annihilationism, and for those who believed a dependent originated result was accomplished through dependent origination, and for those worldly people who were terrified of the profound meaning. However they argued that such practice was incapable of producing the result because a result cannot arise from a dissimilar cause. 

Indeed, Tsongkhapa cites this argument in his sNgags rim chen mo in an implicit refutation of Dzogchen. 

The basic argument is that creation stage practices were unnecessary, and that it was sufficient to rely solely on completion stage practices. 

The counter position to the above is that the natural purity of all phenomena was incapable of stopping false conceptuality and that buddhahood was necessarily predicated on the accumulation of merit, that the creation stage was needed to abandon ordinary vision, and that it was necessary for accomplished the rūpakāyas in order to benefit sentient beings. 

The passage is interesting because it is just about the only passage in all the gsar ma period translations from Sanskrit which address the Great Perfection movement in India (albeit through the names of its promulgators rather than specific texts) and its positions, and contrasts this with what we now take to be the more conventional Vajrayāna approach. 

In other words, I don't see much evidence that Vairocana, for example, was collecting lots of deity practices in Indian and spreading them among Tibetans. While it is certainly true there is a Vimalamitra tradition of Vajrakilaya, and while it is certainly true that Dzogchen can be practiced by people engaged in the creation stage and other kinds of rites, it is also the case that we have examples such as Pang Mipham Gonpo who appear to have practiced only Dzogchen. 

In short, despite SVS's lengthy, interesting and erudite articles, I do not think it is accurate to conclude that Dzogchen was necessarily an adjunct to the practice of the two stages, and I think there is ample evidence to the contrary. 

I think the more accurate position to take (based for example, on Mañjuśrīmitra's Meditation of Bodhicitta) is that buddhahood could also be accomplished indirectly as well, through mantra practice, as he says:

Further, because the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable, and after binding three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

Mipham, summarizing Mañjuśrīmitra's autocommentary, adds:

If it is asked, “What is the method of realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing to the moon with the finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening, because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization. 


Thus, I argue that "early" Dzogchen had nothing to do with sadhana practice at all, and this is proven quite handily by looking at the the bodhicitta texts (should one assume they represent "early" Dzogchen). Does this mean that Dzogchen masters ruled out an indirect path for unfortunates? No. But it does mean the premise "early dzogchen...was originally inseparable from sadhana practice" is false.

It is not a question what works or not. I am quite certain that the vow against taking life was primarily against killing humans, while the commitment of nonharming extends to all living things, plants and animals alike. It is for the latter reason that we see so many of the pācittiyas such as not killing animals, not destroying plants, not digging in the ground, not drinking acohol, etc. are involved with avoiding harms of many kinds.

Jeff, the point is that in Tibet in the Gelug tradition, śamatha meditation was not especially emphasized, historically. 

The fact is that Sakyas and Gelugpas don't do much sūtrayāna style śamatha because they think sadhana practice (reciting texts, chanting mantras, and so on) is a more effective means to reach the same goal. 

However, based on the model of Trungpa's Dharmadhātu, a lot of Western centers adopted courses in śamatha because they noticed that to some extent, people with background in Zen and Vipassana and so on had less difficulties with their practice in general and more stability, especially emotionally.

Steven Batchelor complained about the same thing. Gelugpas do not really do much śamatha traditionally. In fact, one common complaint about both Gelugpas and Sakyapas is that while they are very intellectual, they do not meditate much. 

I have been around Tibetan centers for years and frankly, in my observation, apart from Kagyus, nobody does much traditional sūtrayāna style śamatha and vipaśyāna, and definitely not in the monastery based practice that has been largely spread here in the West.

Annihilationism today
Today many traditionalists claim that the doctrine is most often associated with groups descended from William Miller and the Adventist movement of the mid-1800s, including Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Adventist groups. However, a number of evangelical theologians, including Anglican John Stott, Church of Christ elder Edward Fudge, Open Theists Clark Pinnock and John Sanders, as well as Philip Edgecombe Hughes and others have offered support for the doctrine, touching off a heated debate within mainstream evangelical Christianity.

Since the 1960s, Annihilationism seems to be gaining as a legitimate minority opinion within modern, conservative Protestant theology. It has found support and acceptance among some British evangelicals, although viewed with greater suspicion by their American counterparts.

I think the dividing line between sentient and nonsentient is a great deal more porous than Buddhists would like to acknowledge. 

Then there is the case of earthworm. If you cut an earthworm in half, clearly both sides live on, and indeed will form individuals. Are earthworms sentient or not? If they are, how does their individual sentience arise in absence of conception? 

Perhaps it is the case that Buddhadharma does not account for everything in the Universe, as much as we would like. 

As far as the broom and bridge stories go, they can be found in the Petavatthu. There are a number of examples where monks and so on are born as inanimate objects, pillars, brooms, etc. 

The container/content metaphor (mind/body, spirit/tree, etc.) is a powerful metaphor, but that is all it is.

Sure, when did I ever say otherwise?

The idea that plants are not sentient is a cultural idea, it is not a hard doctrinal Buddhist position.

My point of view is, if it breathes, if it uses prāṇa vāyu, it is sentient.

I have come to the conclusion there is no such thing as nonsentient life.

All phenomena are contaminated apart from path dharmas. So when we say there are ten neutral mental factors, we do not mean they are uncontaminated, we mean they do not belong the group of ten positive mental factors, the six negative mental factors, the fourteen afflicted mental factors and so on. 

Prajñā is one of the ten neutral mental factors.

Desire is a poison. The cetana itself is neither afflicted or nonafflicted by nature, it is neutral. When a cetana is afflicted it is poisoned; therefore, that cetana tends to towards afflicted objects as well. Think of it this way: you are sober, and you see a very unattractive person you would never sleep with. Later, you get drunk (affliction), and in the morning you find yourself in bed with that very same person you never would have slept with in a million years (karma). Only now you have crabs (suffering). This is affliction --&gt; action --&gt; suffering.

Rainbow body is the actual reversion of the matter of the physical body into pristine consciousness (ye shes). As Shabkar says:

As such, after the material atoms dissolve, one manifests as light [...]
Though in trekchö, the subtle atoms
and mind dissolve into the state of reality,
it is nothing other than mere liberation into the state of original purity.



2) Does the illusory universe disappear for the realized Dzogchenpa? If so, how is that different from cessation? If not, what the teaching?[/quote]

From the same text:


The way that great transference body arises:
when all the visions have gradually been exhausted,
when one focuses one’s awareness on the appearances strewn about
on the luminous maṇḍala of the five fingers of one’s hand,
the environment and inhabitants of the universe
returning from that appearance are perceived as like moon in the water.
One’s body is just a reflection,
self-apparent as the illusory body of pristine consciousness;
externally and internally pellucid; free from being harmed by the four elements;
one obtains a vajra-like body.
One sees one’s body as transparent inside and out. 
The impure eyes of others cannot see one’s body as transparent, 
but only the body as it was before;
for example, when the hand of Mutri Tsanpo touched
the body of Master Padmasambhava,
according to account of their meeting.

As for your first question, yes, a Buddha acts free of intention, spontaneously. 

As for your second question, karma does not create karma. Affliction creates karma. In order for there to be a karma, there has to be an afflicted mind, an object, and either attachment or aversion to that object. When an intention about a given object arises, that intention itself is karma. For example, if you see an enemy, that perception of an enemy itself is afflicted. The intention to harm that enemy is itself karma. Falling that, there is derived karma, i.e. the physical actions of body and voice that ensue in trying to kill that enemy.

Yes, in point of fact there is. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu has done more to promulgate Dzogchen teachings than any other living master. Who else teaches Sems sde, klong sde, man ngag sde, etc. in their complete form, not merely as theories, but as practices? Can you name anyone? No? I didn't think so. 

So, while it is true a star, the moon and the sun are all the same in that they illuminate the Earth from the sky, there is a difference in their power to illuminate.

For example, there have been many Dzogchen masters in Tibetan History, but no one would argue that Longchen Rabjam wasn't the greatest Tibetan Dzogchen master in History.

Title: Re: Does Karma explain everything.
Content:
I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then Subha the student, Todeyya's son, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness &amp; excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race? For short-lived &amp; long-lived people are to be seen, sickly &amp; healthy, ugly &amp; beautiful, uninfluential &amp; influential, poor &amp; rich, low-born &amp; high-born, stupid &amp; discerning people are to be seen. So what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness &amp; excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race?"

"Student, beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness &amp; refinement."

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's statement spoken in brief without explaining the detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of his brief statement."

"In that case, student, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."

"As you say, Master Gotama," Subha the student responded.

The Blessed One said: "There is the case, student, where a woman or man is a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing &amp; slaying, showing no mercy to living beings. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell. If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead of reappearing in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell — he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is short-lived wherever reborn. This is the way leading to a short life: to be a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing &amp; slaying, showing no mercy to living beings.

"But then there is the case where a woman or man, having abandoned the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings, and dwells with the rod laid down, the knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, &amp; sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination, in the heavenly world. If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead of reappearing in a good destination, in the heavenly world — he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is long-lived wherever reborn. This is the way leading to a long life: to have abandoned the killing of living beings, to abstain from killing living beings, to dwell with one's rod laid down, one's knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, &amp; sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings.

"There is the case where a woman or man is one who harms beings with his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is sickly wherever reborn. This is the way leading to sickliness: to be one who harms beings with one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives.

"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not one who harms beings with his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is healthy wherever reborn. This is the way leading to health: not to be one who harms beings with one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives.

"There is the case, where a woman or man is ill-tempered &amp; easily upset; even when lightly criticized, he/she grows offended, provoked, malicious, &amp; resentful; shows annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is ugly wherever reborn. This is the way leading to ugliness: to be ill-tempered &amp; easily upset; even when lightly criticized, to grow offended, provoked, malicious, &amp; resentful; to show annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness.

"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not ill-tempered or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, he/she doesn't grow offended, provoked, malicious, or resentful; doesn't show annoyance, aversion, or bitterness. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is beautiful wherever reborn. This is the way leading to beauty: not to be ill-tempered or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, not to be offended, provoked, malicious, or resentful; nor to show annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness.

"There is the case where a woman or man is envious. He/she envies, begrudges, &amp; broods about others' gains, honor, respect, reverence, salutations, &amp; veneration. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is not influential wherever reborn.

"There is the case where a woman or man is obstinate &amp; arrogant. He/she does not pay homage to those who deserve homage, rise up for those for whom one should rise up, give a seat to those to whom one should give a seat, make way for those for whom one should make way, worship those who should be worshipped, respect those who should be respected, revere those who should be revered, or honor those who should be honored. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation...

"There is the case where a woman or man when visiting a brahman or contemplative, does not ask: 'What is skillful, venerable sir? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? What, having been done by me, will be for my long-term harm &amp; suffering? Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &amp; happiness?' Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she will be stupid wherever reborn. This is the way leading to stupidity: when visiting a brahman or contemplative, not to ask: 'What is skillful?... Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &amp; happiness?'

"But then there is the case where a woman or man when visiting a brahman or contemplative, asks: 'What is skillful, venerable sir? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless?

Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term welfare &amp; happiness?'

"So, student, the way leading to short life makes people short-lived, the way leading to long life makes people long-lived; the way leading to sickliness makes people sickly, the way leading to health makes people healthy; the way leading to ugliness makes people ugly, the way leading to beauty makes people beautiful; the way leading to lack of influence makes people uninfluential, the way leading to influence makes people influential; the way leading to poverty makes people poor, the way leading to wealth makes people wealthy; the way leading to low birth makes people low-born, the way leading to high birth makes people highborn; the way leading to stupidity makes people stupid, the way leading to discernment makes people discerning.

Beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness &amp; refinement...

When this was said, Subha the student, Todeyya's son, said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."

Just a minor correction to the translation you are using, it should be:

 "Matter [the material aggregate] is empty (adjective). Emptiness (noun) is matter [one to one identity]. [Therefore] there is no matter apart from emptiness; there is no emptiness apart from matter." 


The same goes for the rest of the five aggregates, as it is said:

Likewise, sensation, perception, formations and consciousness are empty...That being so, all phenomena are emptiness, signlessness, not arising, not ceasing, neither tainted nor free from taints; neither increasing nor decreasing.


So, it is an identity proposition about the nature of reality. But it is not really a proposition, since the sūtra says that this analysis is a training. A training in what? A training in seeing that the five aggregates, all contaminated phenomena are empty of a svabhāva, an inherent nature. 

However, not only contaminated phenomena are empty of a svabhāva, an inherent nature, but also so called pure phenomena, nirvana and so on. 

The message? There is nothing to cling to.

Not all Karma Kagyus were gzhan stong pas (for example, the 8th Karmapa, who refuted it). Gzhan stong only became a Karma Kagyu brand in the late 18th century. And even then, really only at Palpung, which had a close relationship with the Kathok (the one Nyingma monastery where it was very prevalent, also from the late 18th century, as I have already explained to you). 

So, it is not that Karma Kagyu is "off base", since gzhan stong does not define it, it is just gzhan stong that is a bit of a problem. Gelug view is more or less a mirror image of gzhan stong.

Many arguments among scholars have to do with departures from standard definitions and understandings. In Tibetan, such departures are called "rang bzo," literally, "personal fabrications." A lot of effort is spent by Tibetan scholars to prove they are doing nothing original, and their opponents point of view is "novel." 

This is ground upon which both Gelug and Gzhan stong are frequently criticized (justifiably), and just as often, the objects of such criticism try to defend their novelties with baseless hermeneutics.

That's what I say!'
'Would you tell me please,' said Alice, 'what that means?'
'Now you talk like a reasonable child,' said Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased. 'I meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.'
'That's a great deal to make one word mean,' Alice said in a thoughtful tone.
'When I make a word do a lot of work like that,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'I always pay it extra.'
'Oh!' said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.

You are failing to distinguish how that mental factor is being used. For example, a hunter uses his mental factor of samadhi to aim and shoot. A Dharma practitioner on the other hand uses his mental factor of samadhi to engage a path dharma, etc. Nevertheless, samadhi is one of the ten neutral mental factors possessed by all sentient beings.  When someone properly studies Buddhadharma, they understand such points are noncontroversial.

But of course:

During his years as a hermit, Hsu Yun made some of his most profound discoveries. He visited the old master Yung Ching, who encouraged him to abandon his extreme asceticism in favor of temperance. He instructed the young monk in the sutras and told him to be mindful of the Hua Tou, "Who is dragging this corpse of mine?"

In Buddhadharma, samadhi is a neutral mental factor that accompanies all minds. Everyone experiences samadhi all the time, every time they focus their attention single pointedly.

Such a person of great learning learned by sitting with their guru and orally reciting texts: first the ācarya gives a passage, indicating proper rhythm, tone, and so on, passage by passage, one at a time, and the student repeats it until it is memorized. Along with this, the meaning will be explained. Texts support this process, but by no means can they replace it. This kind of learning is fundamentally different than the sort of discursive learning we prefer today. The invention of the printing press fundamentally changed the way Europeans related to texts and the process of learning.

Actually, what is means is that you need a teacher. There are a ton of other citations that make the same point. 

And, of course, there is the story of Sadaprarudita in the 8000 PP sūtra.

There is also the Ārya-kuśalamūla-paridhara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Never be separate from the Sangha,
never be separate from the virtuous mentor.

The Ārya-saṃghāṭi-sūtra-dharmaparyāya states:

When the virtuous mentor is seen, it is seeing the Tathāgata. 

The Ārya-ratnākara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

In order to fully enter the dharmadhātu, one must rely on a virtuous mentor, associate with them and honor them. 

This last one is basically the same in intention as Saraha's statement.

Ho, friends, the connate
can’t be gained from another; it is gained from the mouth of the sublime guru.

Three Hundred Verses on Vinaya states: 
Disciplined, knows the rites of Vinaya, 
loving towards the ill, has a pure retinue, 
diligent in giving assistance with Dharma and materials,
his instruction timely, such a guru is to be praised.  

The Sutrālaṃkara states:
Rely on a virtuous mentor  who is disciplined, peaceful, pacified, 
diligent in the highest qualities, very learned,
understands the truth, eloquent, 
has a loving nature and has abandoned regret. 

The Bodhicaryāvatara states: 
The virtuous mentor 
skilled in the meaning of Mahāyāna 
with the supreme disciplined conduct of a bodhisattva
should never be abandoned even at the cost of one’s life. 

The Ratnāvali states:
If you rely on those who
are content, compassionate and disciplined, 
with the discerning wisdom that removes afflictions,
through knowing them, give them respect.

Many do, for example, ChNN. They just do not generally leave commentaries which become famous in Shedras.

And, you must bear in mind that Mahāyāna subjects are generally speaking subjects for kids and adolescents in Shedras. When we come to Tibetan Dharma as adults, there are many things we perhaps do not know at all and need to learn as context for Vajrayāna. 

But, having entered into Secret Mantra, we should never think of our bodies or sense enjoyments as impure.
