No, this does not follow since existents are productions, whereas cessations are not. 

You are confusing bhava and abhava with asti and nasti. When one says that a cessation does not exist (nasti), one is not making the claim they are nonexistents (abhava). Nonexistents are defined from existents. There is no existent by which a nonexistent cessation might be defined since cessations are not produced to begin with, being unconditioned. Cessations have no being at all, of any kind, including nonbeing. Therefore, they do not exist.

There are two kinds of cessation: analytical and non-analytical. The latter is simply the absence of causes for a series to arise. Example, a burnt seed. The former is the absence of causes due to analysis, for example, the absence of afflictions in an arhat. In absence of afflictions, one ceases taking rebirth. In both of these cases there is no ceased existent through which a nonexistent can be known.

However, investing in the market is an excellent way to observe one's hope when the market rises, and fear when the market declines. So indeed, one can carry investing into the Dzogchen path.

As John Bogle says, a successful investor buys while the market is falling, and sells while market is rising.

The two kinds of rainbow body are based on whether you completed the fourth vision in this life, or in the bardo of the time of death. 

 But all this does not matter much. Even if in this life you only got the second vision, you will still wake up, attain buddhahood in the bardo of dharmatā, i.e. you will finish the fourth vision there. It just takes a longer time in the bardo depending on how much you practiced in this life. At worst, you will wake up in the nirmanakāya buddhafields in your next life without ever returning to samsara again, but this assumes you barely practiced at all.

But all of this is dependent on confirming vidyā in a direct perception, and that must be heard from one's guru.

The word "phenomena" and the term "existent" are deceptive. The term "dharma" (chos) means, in this context, that which bears characteristics. Holding that space is an existent (vastu, dngos po) is totally wrongheaded.

However, space is a dharma because it has a characteristic, absence of impediment. The characteristic of cessation is absence of arising. Thus, since these three dharmas are unproduced, they cannot be held to be existents. 

In other words, all existents are dharmas, but not all dharmas are existents.

It is not a question of agreement or disagreement, it is a question of basic definitions which come from Abhidharma. 

The question of whether space and cessations were existents was settled a thousand years before Tsongkhapa. 

The only way one can argue that space and cessations are existents is to accept the existence of nonarising existents, which of course eliminates one's ability to refute atmans, and other permanently functional phenomena.

Not sure where you are coming up with these terms "basis enlightenment" and "path enlightenment." 

The difference between buddhas of the 11th and 12th bhumi and the rest is that the former have not realized all phenomena as a display of pristine consciousness and the latter have. But in general, bhumis measure qualities rather than realizations. In particular, in this book, the 16 stages are analogues of the common paths and stages, but are not actually identical with them.

Since the basic cittamatra statement is, "The three realms are mind only" I see no difference since three realms includes everything included in the three thousands worlds. Is there something included in the "three thousand worlds" of the slogan that is not included in the triloka/tridhātu?

If all of this is included in a moment of mind, it just does not go beyond cittamatra. 

Recall, the basic assertion of cittamatra is "The three realms are only mind." This includes everything, buddhas, sentient beings, grass, trees, hell beings, the lot.

Now, if this mind is itself held to be empty, lacking any nature, then that is a different thing; and this statement cannot be considered complete in and of itself. If this mind is also empty (and given that it is momentary, it must be dependently originated) then Tien tai view would be akin to Yogacāra Madhyamaka, and would not go beyond that.

Ucchedavāda means "those who advocate cutting off," that is annihilation rather than nihilism. It is the assertion that since the person ceases at death, there is no karma, not future lives, etc.

Śaśvatavāda is the assertion that an entity, an atman, a world, etc., is permanent and undergoes no change, hence eternalism.

Both positions contradict dependent origination, the middle way.

The assertion does not work that way. The assertion is not that a moment of mind exists in three thousand x's. What this assertion is basically saying is that everything, all possible existences, from hell to buddhahood, are included in a single moment of mind. This assertion does not go beyond cittamatra. If this assertion is the pinnacle of Tien tai thinking, then Tien tai does not go beyond cittamatra, no matter how hard one tries to fight one's way out of the bag.

Time is also a function of our own merit. We have the merit to be born during the dispensation of a supreme nirmanakāya. But that merit does not come from outside. It comes from our own roots of virtue. 

In terms of the eighteen qualities of a perfect human birth, there are ten endowments; five are personal, five are external. According to Nāgārjuna, the five personal endowments are:

A human, born in the central country, complete sense organs, 
not engaging in wrong livelihood, faith in the object 

The five external endowments are:

The Buddha has arrived, he has taught the Dharma, 
the doctrine exists, there are followers of that, 
and there is kindheartedness towards others.

In order to enjoy these ten endowments, one must have the eight freedoms:

Birth as one holding wrong views, as animals, pretas, and hell beings, 
as one without the teaching of the victor, or in a border country,
birth as a barbarian, as one stupid and dumb,
or birth as any of the long-lived gods
are the eight faults of lacking freedom. 
Having acquired the freedom that is liberated from those states.
one must make effort in order to avoid them.

As such, converting others is impossible.

They had the merit to meet the Dharma. Plain and simple. If they had not cultivated roots of merit to meet the Dharma they 1) would not be born in a place where the Dharma existed 2) would not be interested in the Dharma even slightly. 

This does not mean of course, that one should silently remain in one's house. But it does mean that only those people with the roots of merit to meet the Dharma will meet it and embrace it. In places where it is hard for the Dharma to take root, one can presume that that place is not a place where there are people with merit to take up the Dharma in this life.

Just to bring remind everyone, the four defeats are: killing a human being, sexual misconduct, stealing, and lying about one's realization.

I am saying if taken literally it does not correspond to dependent origination, i.e., where this exists, that exists, etc.

For example, when Buddha levitated to the height of 14 palm trees, those who understand the principles underlying such yogic feats will not necessarily be impressed (it has to do with controlling the vāyu in the body). One of the side effects of mastering the two stages is the ability to generate illusions at will. Therefore, we really don't need to take these reports literally, especially when such tales also have an esoteric interpretation, many of which are found in the Caryagiti's commentary. For example, Virupa's stopping the sun is actually a reference to placing the winds in the central channel and so on. If Virupa literally stopped the sun for three days, it certainly would have been reported elsewhere in the world.

Or for example, Shabkar reports running into people who claimed repeatedly to have seen him flying in the sky. In his autobiography he denied having this ability, even though he admits to having dreams of flying, you can look into this yourself.

And Greg, when you yourself are capable of such things as cutting of your own head, I will believe you. Until then, I think you are just being extremely gullible.

I still maintain one does not have to convert to Buddhism to be Dzogchen practitioner. But if you understand Dzogchen teachings, how can you not be a follower of Buddhadharma? Buddhism in all its many forms and Buddhadharma are just not the same thing at all. The former is involved in all kinds of beliefs, judgments, bias, discrimination, etc. The latter is based on personal experience.

And who knows, maybe someday, as someone who has demonstrated mercurial flexibility and willingness to change their view, I'll will come to the view that Dzongsar has every quality you think he has. I never met him apart from offering him a khata once in the usual pro-forma khata line at a teaching of Jnanavajra's in Upstate NY, so I honestly have no idea. Many of my friends who know him like him quite a lot. This just isn't personal, it's about what he wrote, not who he is.

How is it hypocritical for her to use an endorsement video of Dzongsar at time when all this stuff had not gone down? 

Obviously he feels miffed that she did not observe a quid pro quo and voiced her lack of approval of his "joke." 

That does not make her a hypocrite any more than it makes Dzongsar a hypocrite for having accepted many invitations to Lerab Ling even though he made it pretty clear he does not think much of Sogyal as a teacher. Or it makes them both hypocrites. You can't have it both ways.

Batchelor is ridiculous. 

You have some Western Buddhists, encouraged by cultural attitudes of Tibetans, who think that gurus are popes and one should never observe the fact that they pee, defecate, eat, make mistakes, and so on, and are fundamentally incapable of harming their students for any reason once they and the student undertake a ritualized contract the students superstitiously believe is going to earn them a place in Vajra Hell if they do not accept every abuse handed out to them by a guru with poor conduct; and then you have the other extreme of Buddhists who are so timid they refuse to understand the importance of lineage transmission and that gurus are present in every level of Buddhist teachings, from Hinayāna to Vajrayāna.

Guess that is how it goes these days.

The only way to cut off rebirth in the three lowers realms is by achieving stream entry (Hinayāna) or patience on the path of application (Mahāyāna) or strong heat (Vajrayāna). With respect to patience, this takes many eons to reach on the common Mahāyāna path. 

There are no other means. And when we are talking about people who hate the Dharma as much as ISIS people, it will be incalculable eons before they have cultivated a sufficient root of merit for meeting the Dharma.

Unfortunately, it now seems that the main thing propping up Vajrayāna is precisely the eight worldly dharmas. Why?

Sadly, we have come to a time when prominent teachers of the Dharma resort to petulant admonitions on Facebook when advertising their teachings in response to criticism of their jokes which were not well received by women in general and their defense of someone whom most people seem to agree is a very abusive person under the pretext of samaya.

It is a statement that belongs on every Buddhist forum no matter what the stripe. The whole reason we in Tibetan Buddhism refer to ourselves as nang pas, insiders, is due to the fact that as insiders we understand that liberation comes about only through our own effort, not from appealing to external forces.

Your question actually is "Best political system for Dharma" with no qualifications. 

And I still say that since the fortunes of Dharma when connected to the fortunes of kings decline when the fortune of this or that king declines, I'll pick modern Democracy, since it is predicated on separation of church and state.

For example, China, 843. The Taoist emperor of China, Wuzong ruthlessly destroyed 4600 Buddhist monasteries.

Langdarma was doubtlessly influenced by this guys move to eliminate the tax free status of Monasteries in Tibet and was assassinated for his trouble.

They are capitalist economies with free markets. 

The basic principle of a free market is that consumers need to able to make informed choices. One of the things (even conservative economists used to admit this) is that people cannot make informed choices about is health care, for example. Since people cannot make informed choices about some things, these kinds of things should be strictly regulated, as they are in those countries, and Canada.  

But apart from things like healthcare and education, these countries you mention do not really have centrally planned economies. They are "socialist" only in so far as their governments provide social services to everyone. But in reality, they are no more socialist than the New Deal was socialist.

The standard of living for Chinese people has markedly increased under the Chinese policies that allow Chinese firms to manufacture goods for the US market. The same is true in Vietnam, etc. This has happened because these countries have embraced market economics, albeit, not fully. 

At base, what we have are two functions related to the formation of states: power and markets. All states are created to protect markets. It is the only reason they have for existence. This is very clearly pointed out in Buddhists sūtras. 

One can fantasize all one wants about stateless societies, and so on, but in fact as long as there are markets, there will be states. The only way to be rid of states is to be rid of markets. That will never happen.

This is not a free market. True capitalism requires free markets and freedom of information. When one does not have these, markets become distorted and in the end, this causes economic collapse. 

Mind you, I am not suggesting that capitalism is the end all be all, it isn't. However, no one has come up with a better way to deliver goods and services to people yet that has worked out in practice on the broad international scale we see. In general, one of the main reasons for the failure of so many US attempts to open markets around the world is precisely due to the fact that "free markets" do not function well in authoritarian regimes. This is why the US always ties democracy to capitalism, and in those countries where democracy fails, capitalism demonstrably fails as well in favor of the kind of mercantile economies we see in China, etc.

Actually, one of the interesting things about Trumpism is its fundamentally anti-capitalist messaging. "Economic nationalism" cripples free-market capitalism.

Depend on what Tibetan word. The Tibeten word most commonly translated as devotion is mos gus, or gus pa. 

Mos gus is combined term that does not have a real Sanskrit term underneath it. It combined from mos pa and gus pa. 

Mos pa only translates adhimokṣa and its various forms. It means confidence or interest. Gus pa translate two terms primarily, ādara and satkṛtya, both of which mean to pay respect.

Thus the terms we usually see translated as "devotion" really mean, "confident interest" and "respect". 

Thus, when we see the term "devotion" in a Tibetan Buddhist book, we should understand that it really has nothing to do with the English history of the word, which really means "formal vow." Devotion means "love, loyalty, or enthusiasm for a person, activity, or cause:" Of these three, it is only the third definition, enthusiasm, which is really indicated by the term in its Buddhist sense. This does not bar us from having love for or loyalty to our gurus, teachers, etc. But just to be clear, we should expect love from our gurus, since the texts on the qualities of the guru all describe the guru as loving, and they in return should expect our interest and respect.

Because of the Versailles Treaty, Germany was forced to pay reparations. This led to out of control inflation in Germany during the Weimar Republic. Germany reneged on its repayments, which in turn caused British and French banks to panic. Unable to meet their obligation to American Banks (from which they had borrowed heavily in the War), this caused the American stock market collapse in 1929. Emboldened by the incompetence of Weimar Republic, as well as the inability of the other parties to muster a solid response to the economic climate of Germany, in this fractured political and economic environment the Nazis skated into Parliament by the skin of their teeth. The rest is history, and the cause of it all is the humiliation Germans felt because of the Versailles Treaty. The Great Depression, in other words, was a direct consequence of the Versailles treaty. At least, this is what I learned at Harvard.

Wow, incredible. As if guru yoga means spreading your legs for someone from whom one has received an empowerment.  If a man sexually harasses women this means he sees women as objects to be used and discarded. This is about as disgusting and wrong headed as you can get. BTW, I am not a lama.

I mean, what is the point of this? Why should a women who has suffered sexual harassment from Tibetans who are acting in the role of spiritual guides care about their cultural perspective? It is obvious that the Tibetan cultural perspective devalues women. This is all we need to know. We all know what the cultural context is. Tibet is a culture where one of the commonly used names for women means "inferior birth" (skye dman).

The reason it was poorly received in many quarters is that is was poorly conceived. Ethnic moral relativism is nonsense.

We are inside that loop. We pay taxes to a government that prosecutes those wars. We can pretend that we are free of complicity, but really, we aren't. 

Our very lifestyle in the first world caused this. Neoliberal ideology supposes that if we just spread capitalism (under the guise of Democracy) on a wide enough scale, fast enough, everyone will be pacified with commodities. Of course this is not going to happen. 

So these wars result. Amongst the people fighting these wars are those on both sides who use toxic ideologies to promote their cause. Some are more toxic than others. 

Sooner or later human beings as a whole are going to have to accept that we live on a planet with limited resources that need to be equitably distributed to all. 

But I don't see this happening, what I see happening is that we are just moving deeper and deeper into the Kali Yuga, and that about the best we can do is all palliative.

We are part of it, however. It is not avoidable. So people take differing perspectives. Some people take the perspective that dealing with Daesh and other fanatic terrorist groups with military force is regrettable but unavoidable. 

Other people take the point of view that Buddhists should under every circumstance take a pacifist position and argue that their respective governments should stay out of international affairs. I personally see that as an irresponsible point of view. 

I have a pragmatic position. Until Daesh is out of the way, it is difficult to move forward in any thing like a lasting peace in the region. Just look at how the lack of de-Nazification is playing out in East Germany and Austria, as opposed to Western Germany.

And since we are talking about my other comment referring to Daesh fighters, eliminating them prevents them from engaging in further nonvirtues. As it is, those people are going to spend eons in lower realms for their crimes against sentient beings. Just to be clear, Daesh is a special case, like SS soldiers. There really is only one thing to be done with them. In general, however, I don't support wars.

gdon gzugs bon gyi bstan pa bsnubs. 

The word in the text is bsnubs. It means either "med par gtong ba," "sent into nonexistence"  or "nub par byed pa", "caused to decline." 

It does not have the strong connotations of other Tibetan words, such as 'joms, to conquer, brlag pa, to crush. 

The commentary by Dilgo Khyentse on this line states that the Bonpos were defeated in debate by Padmsambhava and Shantarakshita through citation and reasoning. They were then exiled by royal decree, and their teaching disappeared. 

If you look at the broader history, this refers to a faction in the Tibetan court of Trisong Detsen that maintained connections to the overthrown Zhang Zhung kingdom whose power over Tibet had been shrugged off a century before when Srong Tsan Gampo engineered the assassination of King Ligmincha. "Bonpos" then are not the Bonpos we have today. And in other Kathang literature, we have clear examples of Padmasambhava interceding on behalf of some Bonpos whose practices did not involve animal and human sacrifice, so called "good Bonpos." So here, the so called "Bonpos" who were exiled were a specific political faction of Tibetans.

The point is that such beings would manifest their qualities whether they were recognized or not by some hierarchy. 

I am sure too you are familiar with the story of Khyentse Wangpo becoming tired of the doubts of a recently deceased lama's disciples. Since they had doubts about the recognized tulku, Khyentse took them to a barn, called out the lamas name, and when a calf answered, he said, "This is your actual Lama."

BTW, I have no interest in debating the authenticity of Dzongsar's recognition. You brought that up. I have no idea why, actually. But it is your trip, not mine. I am quite happy for the positive things that he does, like the 84,000 project and so on.  I frankly don't care whether he is an "authentic" tulku or not. It would never enter my mind to select a teacher based on their tulku recognition status. It would never enter my mind to do so because such a criteria is just not important to me at all.

That is called "entitlement."  And perhaps, that is why he does not like western liberals like myself. We don't care much for authority, aristocrats, and entitled hierarchies, spiritual or otherwise. 

MaybeTibetan Buddhism is in need of a "Protestant" reformation. Whatever the case, there is certainly a growing rift between traditional hierarchies and Western students over such as issues as sex, power, money, and authority. These things need to be discussed openly and without fear of repercussion.

There is a difference between actual nirmanakāyas and recognized tulkus. The former need no recognition at all since their qualities are evident in their compassionate deeds which benefit sentient beings, for example, Dudjom Lingpa who was never recognized by anyone as a tulku of Duddul Dorje. 

As for myself, I have met quite enough nominally recognized tulkus to be quite convinced that the tulku recognition system should be put out of business, a sentiment I believe Dzongsar Khyentse largely shares.

Buddha did not crack jokes, for example. Neither did Guru Rinpoche. 

Of course, we like jokes, and many people found his joke very funny. I admit that I even found it mildly amusing in a rather sophomoric way, but I knew it was going to create a minor shitstorm.

I just don't buy his knockoff Trungpaesque Burlesque Show, if you will. Wrong era. Taunting western liberals in the age of Trump is not well considered. Especially given the rise of the racism and nationalism around the world.

If one accepts Mahāyāna, one accepts that in order to attain buddhahood according to the common Mahāyāna path, one must traverse five paths and the ten bodhisattvas stages for a minimum of ten incalculable eons. 

On the three pure stages, one no longer resides in the desire realm, but in various form realm heavens, as well as the buddhafield of Ghanavyuha. 

A supreme nirmanakāya will, in their last birth prior to manifesting supreme buddhahood, reside as the bodhisattva Svetaketu (really a title more than a name) teaching the Tushita gods. They will then select a family from either the merchant, warrior, or priestly family and descend into the mother's womb and display the 12 deeds. 

It may be objected that a tenth stage bodhisattva is not a buddha, but in fact Maitreyanath states, "that stage beyond the ninth stage is a stage of buddhahood." And even so, as the Lanka states, "The actual buddha (the samboghakāya) attains awakening in Akaniṣṭha, the nirmanakāya displays the attainment of buddha here."

All mandalas such as Vajrakīlaya, Kalacakra, etc., are in fact symbolic representations of Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyhua, which is why one can in this body attain buddhahood in this lifetime providing one is an extremely diligent practitioner. In other words when you perfect the creation stage as an ārya bodhisattva, you are abiding in the samadhi of Akaniṣṭha, and therefore, through the completion stage, one can attain buddhist in this life time in this very body.

The requirement for engaging in karmamudra practices is that one is free from desire. Otherwise, there is what is known as the yoga of passion, where one's partner and oneself engage in lovemaking in the form of the one's chosen deity. However, this requires both partners have the same empowerments and practice. 

Also, from a Dzogchen point of view, karmamudra and other practices which try to harness desire are generally viewed as being expedients for people with excessive desire in until they are ready for serious practice. Also, from a Dzogchen perspective, the benefit of karmamudra practice is only for men due to differences in male and female biology (i.e., female orgasm is not connected with ejaculation).

I am not sure who transmits his termas, but his lineage of karling shitro is also widespread in Kathog and so on.

Migyur Dorje is commonly referred to even by his followers as "Ternyon (gter smyon)," i.e., "the mad terton." His capacity for displaying irrational behavior is legendary.

No, Yonge Migyur Dorje, a Karma Kagyu terton with close ties to the tenth Karmapa. Yes, there is a connection with the present Migyur Rinpoche.

No, I was expressing my opinion about a person who happens to be a Gelugpa, who was engaged in intense sectarianism, not merely in his old age, but in his middle years through his old age, and the fact that I would never take any teaching in which that person was present as a lineage holder.

I would maintain the same attitude towards any Sakyapa, Nyingmapa, or Kagyupa who demonstrated the same behavior.

No, Nyingmapas who have an opinion about this generally feel that Migyur Dorje was the problem. 

You can read about about this conflict in Brian Cuevas's book on Karling Shitro.

The rule is, if a teacher's faults outweigh their qualities by a large margin, then that is a teacher to avoid. If a teacher's qualities outweigh their faults by a large margin, then this is a teacher one might consider adopting. If a teacher's faults are in even proportion to their qualities, also this is a teacher to avoid. 

If a teacher's activities are largely harmful to the Dharma, such a promulgating mistaken views and practices,  engaging in political violence to subdue religious enemies, harming disciples through inappropriate actions and so on, then one can consider this person a mad guide, someone whose very lineage must be avoided. 

For example, there was a conflict between the terton Nyima Drakpa and the Yonge Terton, Mingyur Dorje. To this day many Nyingmapas will not receive the transmission of any of Yonge Mingyur Dorje treasures. Likewise, many Kagyus avoid the transmission of Nyima Drakpa's transmission of the Karling Zhitro, etc. For many centuries, Ngorpas avoided receiving the transmission of Lamdre and Naro Khacho from the Tshar subschool, and so on. There are in Tibetan history many examples of this kind of thing.

It is not sectarian to wish to avoid receiving lineages from a teacher who openly advocated the destruction of Nyingma, Sakya, and Kagyu monasteries, statues of Guru Padmasambhava, as well as Dharma scriptures.

But if you think it is "nonsectarian" to receive lineages through such teachers, go right ahead.

Tendai is not skeptical towards the two truths, they simply reconcile them into a third truth, which is more or less the same as the widespread notion that the two truths are inseparable.

"Buddhahood in this body" is a Mantrayāna slogan introduced to Japan by Kukai. The very notion of it is grounded in Mantrayāna. It is not a common Mahāyāna idea. The common Mahāyāna idea is the very opposite. 

The point of view on the relationship of Sūtra and Mantrayāna in Tendai is a little similar to the Gelugpa school in that both schools subordinate Vajrayāna practices to a sūtrayāna view. Needless to say, there is much dissent from this perspective both in Japan and Tibet.

Buddhahood does not happen in this Sahaloka, though the nirmanakāya generates appearance of the attainment of buddhahood under the bodhitree as play to give people confidence that they can attain buddhahood. Actual buddhahood is attained in Akaniṣṭha.

Who said you had to believe in Nāgās? I mean, if you don't you are more likely to disturb them and cause problems for yourself and others, but you are not required to believe in them.

As  a Dharma practitioner, however, you will never realize the true nature of your mind if you negate rebirth and karma.

This is HHDL's cross to bear. 

Pabhongkha acted harmfully against the Dharma because his intense sectarianism was clearly motivated by his relationship with the Gyalpo and inflamed by it. It was not a minor thing. 

No one talks about the fact that Devadatta was a pure monk in the beginning, with devotion to the Buddha; we only discuss the fact that later he tried to harm the Buddha.

You must think the Buddha had ontological misapprehensions, he constantly spoke of places, both here and beyond here, and in time as well. To deny this is foolish, and to try and explain it away, trite. The emptiness of things in no way contradicts their appearance and order.

The only thing you really need to ascertain is whether his lineage goes through Pabhongkha or not. I personally would never receive any teaching that comes through this teacher, for obvious historical reasons. It is not good to have negative feelings about any lineage master.

The idea that the title essentializes a text is not unknown in Indian exegesis. The idea however that the words of a title are the actual Buddha indicated in the sutra is a novelty. 

There is nothing novel about a given sūtra or tantra existing in many forms, short to long, which are in essence the same text. But of course, are there really texts in Dharma? In fact what there are is artifacts representing the realization of the Buddha which exist in many forms throughout the eons.

But not Indian commentaries, for the most part. For example, there is no precedent in Indian Buddhism for taking the title of a sūtra and turning it into a chanting practice in Indian Buddhism at all (actually, there is no precedent for it in Sino-Japanese Buddhism either).

My point is that the later (post Yogacara) Indian tradition took a synthetic and systematic view where the sūtras were viewed as raw material out of which systemic approaches to the Dharma were elaborated, and sūtra exegesis became subordinate to these Indian philosophical schools. For example, take the disregard with which Madhyamaka would treat Yogacara sūtra sources, etc.

I have also observed Tibetans being quite surprised at what is actually stated in this or that tantra, because Tibetans in general depend on scholastic manuals for everything, rather than primary materials. It is only the expert senior scholars who work with primary materials.
