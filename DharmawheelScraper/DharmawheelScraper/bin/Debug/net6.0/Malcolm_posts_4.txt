There is a progression from causes and conditions (both outer and inner phenomena) --&gt; dependent origination (causes and conditions of sentient beings) --&gt; karma and its ripening (the causes and conditions of virtuous, nonvirtuous, and neutral volitions, their physical and verbal expressions, and the consequences of those expressions). 

Karma paints the canvas of emptiness and appearance with happiness and suffering.

The main point of Buddhism is to eliminate the three afflictions—confusion, hatred, and desire—which are the cause of actions which inevitably result in suffering. Awakening has no other purpose for oneself than this.

There are a variety of problems here. 1) there is only one passage in all of the sutras that define three turnings, the Samdhinirmocana. 2) The Indians completely ignored this division of sūtras, which I have show elsewhere. 3) Tibetan interpretations of this are so varied as to render the doctrine virtually meaningless. 4) Not all of the so-called third turning sūtras can be accepted as definitive. 5) Mādhyamikas use a different sūtra to ascertain the distinction between definitive and provisional, the Akṣayamatinirdeśa:

What are the sūtras of definitive meaning and the sūtras of implicit meaning? The sūtras that are taught in order to help one enter the way are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to help one reach the fruit of the way are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to demonstrate the relative truth are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to demonstrate the ultimate truth are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to help one engage in actions and duties are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught for the sake of the cessation of actions and afflictions are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to explain affliction are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to explain purification are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to produce disgust for existence are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to help one enter the nonduality of nirvāṇa and existence are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught with various words and syllables are called implicit, while the sūtras that teach that which is deep, hard to see, and hard to understand are called definitive. The sūtras with many words and syllables that are taught in order to please the thoughts of living beings are called implicit, [F.150.b] while the sūtras with few words and syllables that are taught in order to produce mental introspection in living beings are called definitive. The sūtras that, with various words, proclaim a self, a being, a life principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, a personality, a human being, a man, a subject that acts, and a subject that feels and those that teach that there is a ruler where there is no ruler are called implicit. The sūtras that teach emptiness, the absence of distinguishing marks, the absence of anything to long for, the unconditioned, the unborn, the unoriginated, the nonexistent, the absence of self, the absence of being, the absence of soul, the absence of person, the absence of spirit, the absence of ruler, and the gates of liberation are called definitive. This is called the reliance on the sūtras of definitive meaning, not on the sūtras of implicit meaning.

Do dualistic appearances exist apart from a consciousness or not? And if in fact dualistic appearances are utter nonexistents (which the yogacārins claim is the case), how is the consciousness in which they appear conditioned? What are the causes and conditions of this substantial consciousness? 

This is the whole problem with the yogacārin interpretation of the three nature and why mādhyamikas attack it. 

As far as I can tell, you are misreading Jñānagarbha, conflating his "mere thing" with Asanga's "mere thing":

 'A mere thing (vastu-mātra), which is not confused with anything that is imagined and arises dependently, is known as correct relative [truth].'

Asanga's "mere thing" in the BBh is an ineffable ultimate, as indicated above.

Title: Re: Are all Mahayana sutras sutras of definitive meaning?

My definition comes from how it is read from Tibetan. 

The Tibetan verse is very simple:

གཞན་གྱི་དབང་གི་ངོ་བོ་ཉིད། །རྣམ་རྟོག་ཡིན་ཏེ་རྐྱེན་ལས་བྱུང༌།

The inherent nature of the dependent is conceptuality, which arose from conditions.

Sthiramati glosses this as follows

"Conceptuality" shows the inherent nature of dependent. "Arose from conditions" shows the cause of production of the so-called "dependent...That is the imputed, the distinct nonvirtuous, virtuous, and neutral minds and mental factors of the three realms. Since causes and conditions are called "dependent," dependent is a convention for "generative." In other words, it shows arising dependent on other causes and conditions apart from itself. 

So you see the dependent itself is not "dependent," it produces conceptuality, i.e. samsara, which is different than itself. If it were the same thing as conceptuality, it could not be suchness, in this case, vijnāptimatra, perception-only. 

།གྲུབ་ནི་དེ་ལ་སྔ་མ་པོ། །རྟག་ཏུ་མེད་པར་གྱུར་པ་གང༌།

The perfected means the latter has never existed in the former.

Sthiramati glosses this as follows:

How is it the perfected? It is said, "The perfected is the nonexistence of the latter in the former." Since there is no change, it is the perfected. "In the former" refers to the dependent. "The latter" refers to the imputed. Conceptuality imputes the entities of apprehended objects and apprehending subjects. In this way, since there is imputation, despite the nonexistence of apprehended objects and apprehending subjects in the former, it is called "imputation." The permanent absence of an apprehended object and apprehending subject in the dependent is inherent nature of the perfected. 

།དེ་ཕྱིར་དེ་ཉིད་གཞན་དབང་ལས། །གཞན་མིན་གཞན་མ་ཡིན་པའང་མིན།

Therefore, suchness is neither different nor not different from the dependent. 

Sthiramati glosses this as follows:

"Therefore, suchness" refers the the permanent voidness of the imputed in the dependent, which is the perfected. Voidness is dharmatā. Dharmatā is neither the same nor different than phenomena. The perfected is the dharmtā of the dependent, therefore, one should understand that the perfected is neither the same nor different than the dependent. If the perfected were different than the dependent, the dependent would not be empty of the imputed. How is it not different? The perfected doe not become a support of purity, because [the dependent] has the nature of universal afflictions while it is the dependent. When under the power of poisonous clinging, it becomes the nature of universal affliction. However, because it is not different than the perfected, it resembles the perfected. 

Sthiramati prefaces this by stating that three inherent natures in perception-only is noncontradictory. This is why we can understand there is some misunderstanding of the term "dependent." The dependent cannot itself be dependent, upon what would it depend? Nonexistent object and subjects? Instead, it is fulcrum for samsara and nirvana. 

A little later he concludes, "Phenomena here are included in the dependent, the perfected is like space. Gnosis is one taste. As it is said, "nonconceptual wisdom perceives all phenomena to be like space" because the mere suchness of all phenomena is seen by the dependent."

With respect to the dependent being something substantial, a dravya, Sthiramati raises this qualm:

"If the dependent is substantial, why does the sutra show that 'All phenomena lack inherent existence, neither arising nor ceasing'?" There is no conflict." and then proceeds to discuss the three inherent natures, and the three absences of inherent nature. 

Any, my point is simple, the Yogacārins clearly define consciousness as a substance, they are clearly unhappy if one denies the existence of this substance, and given the absence of another other than minds in their scheme of the universe, their presentation of mind-only in the sūtras suffers from a realist bias.

Śākyamuni dismissed it. The whole reason he taught dependent origination, "Where this exists, that exists," etc., was in response to monks pestering him about who they were in past lives. In the Abhidharmakośabhaṣya, vol. 2, pg. 406, "Whoever, Oh Bhikṣus, knows through prajñā, pratītyasamutpāda, and the dharmas produced through dependence, will not turn himself towards the past by asking if he existed..."

The simple fact is that we took birth in this life due to affliction and karma, and we will continue to do so if we do not eliminate karma and affliction.

No, he is refuting Madhyamaka specifically in asserting that there is a real, existent, ineffable something which is ultimate, an actual basis of designation. No mādhyamika will accept this. Asanga's definition of emptiness is that the emptiness of a thing is always its emptiness of something else. In this case, specifically, he is asserting the existence of suchness, his "bare substance," which is only empty of names such as form, and so on. What is this suchness he is asserting? It is the dependent nature, of course, which he asserts exists ultimately. So, he does not escape the charge of asserting something compounded becomes uncompounded in the transformation of the basis. Why? Because the purification of the all-basis consciousness is the entire keystone of the yogacāra system. I will leave it here because we are going now in circles. 

In Madhyamaka, the ultimate is simply the absence of inherent existence in conventional entities. 

BTW, Mipham is not really helpful for you here. As I pointed out already, his interpretation of the Madhyantavibhanga is not possible in Sanskrit. One cannot simply revise rnam par rig pa to rnam par snang ba to try and harmonize MVB with Madhyamaka. It doesn't work.

You can find evidence of this in the Bodhisattvabhumi [Engles, pp. 77-86], where Asanga excoriates mādhyamikas for over-negation, where he describes the negation of a designation as valid, but strongly objects to the negation of the basis of designation, a so-called "bare substance." He tries to play off śrāvaka realists on the one hand who hold characteristics truly exist, and mādhyamikas who negate [pg. 80] a "substance that truly exists in ultimate truth in the form of an ineffable essence." He goes on to say that the latter are true nihilists who should be avoided at all costs. He continues [pg. 80], "For someone who denies the bare [underlying] substance of such entities as form, etc., neither ultimate reality nor [verbal designations exist, they are both invalid." 

For Asanga, "bare substance," vastumātram, is a synonym of  suchness. 

Finally in Brunhölzl, vol.1, 192, Vimuktisena's reference to gold as an example of purity may be found. Here it is it seen that the dependent nature, the cognition that appears as the unreal or appears as real is never itself negated. And, given Asanga's references to a "bare substance' in the BBh above, one can only conclude that this ultimate is an existent cognition devoid of duality, itself ultimately established even if its contents are not, since, it cannot be nonexistent according to the Yogacāra scheme set forth by Asanga.

The three own natures, parikalpita, paratantra, and parinispanna contain two problems. The first problem is how the all-basis consciousness is understood. If we consider paratantra, the dependent nature, to be the all-basis consciousness, there is an internal contradiction in asserting that something compounded becomes uncompounded in the transformation of the basis into the perfected nature, parnispanna. 

If on the other hand, we considered the perfected nature to be empty of the imagined nature and the dependent nature, there is a problem of the inability to reconcile this with the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. 

There are other problems with Yogacāra view as well, which mainly arise from their reluctance to accept that consciousness is also a dependent designation. 

So, what do we rely upon yogacāra for? Yogacāra has an extensive explanation of the Mahāyāna paths and stages. So, we rely on Madhyamaka for view and Yogacāra for practice.

I don't agree. There are no gods in Buddhism, as conceived by Greeks, etc., where they viewed the gods as immortal. Devas are mortal, just sentient beings like the rest of us. Hence, we are atheist. 

As for the vicissitudes and complexities of darshans in India, Mimamsas certainly held that atmans were permanent, etc., even if they rejected a creator god, just as Samkhya holds that atmans are permanent, etc. 

We deny all of this in Buddhism. So while I agree that nastika is not a precise equivalent, it is functionally equivalent, meaning, "We reject your beliefs."

There is a great deal of difference. The Sakya system is based in an uncommon hermeneutical tradition called the "ultimate secret" (guhyānta), which is a special tradition of Naropa's not taught to Marpa.

As far as I know, the Ghantapada tradition in Drikung comes through Shridhara, rather than Marpa. It has the same source as the five deity tradition in Sakya, but a different lineage, and hence the explanations are different, mode of empowerments is different, and so on. It's does not mean one is better than the other, they are just very different expressions of the same mandala.

Spoken like a true fundamentalist. Apparently you didn’t get the memo on the distinction between provisional and definitive teachings. Things like cosmology, biology, etc., are provisional.

Your example is misplaced. Kongtrul was certainly quite knowledgable, but he never left Tibet, he never knew the world was round, that the earth revolved around the sun, and so on. These things are not necessary to know in order to attain liberation. This conversation is boring. People like you show up on Dharmawheel, all full of piss and vinegar, eager to defend ancient, outdated models as if their conventional validity is intact because they showed up in some sūtra somewhere, none of which were in fact spoken directly by the Buddha, all of which are later revelations, composed for this and that reason. To the extent that any of them are consistent with an identifiable model of liberation taught by the Buddha, we then accept them as Buddhadharma. But we do not have to accept flat earths, Sumerus, and so on. The present Dalai Lama, within my own hearing, rejects the ancient cosmology taught by the Buddha and which is present in Kongtrul's encyclopedia. Why? Because it is contradicted by empirical observation. Modern Tibetan attempts to defend this ancient cosmology, of which there are a few, are just exercises in romantic, wishful thinking. Next you will be insisting that the hell realms are located so many yojanas beneath the ground, that a ring of iron mountains surrounds the four continents in order to prevent the stink of the rive surrounding hell from killing us all, and so on. Please.

Flatworms reproduce both sexually and asexually: through budding, and through segmentation, They are also fully hermaphroditic. 

One can’t really explain their reproduction through recourse to the old four birthplaces model, which is not fully functional as a grand theory of every type of reproduction. For example, heat and moisture birth actually describes the egg birth of insects, etc., some animals and birds are capable of parthenogenesis. We don’t need to fit modern biology into ancient biology anymore than we need to fit modern cosmology into ancient cosmology. 

Also, gandharvas possess all five aggregates, and the descent of consciousness “into the womb” is intentional, not unconscious or mechanical. Please examine chapter three of the Abhidharmakoshabhasya.

The aim of Buddhadharma is liberation, it presupposes a number of things foreign to what we call modern philosophy in the West. Indeed, “philosophy” as a program does not even exist in Buddhadharma. Buddhadharma does not aim for “truth for truths sake,” as conceived by westerners, an abstract principle or ideal, since it is not attainable conceptually, from a Buddhist pov. 

You are conflating so called “natural philosophy,” which eventually became “science” with what we today understand as philosophy., which has largely abandoned the search for first principles. 

It does not serve our purposes here to make anachronistic claims.

It is important to understand that Longchenpa's  byang chub sems, rtsal, and rol pa scheme is explained in order clarify that Dzogchen does not reject outer objects (rol pa). Some people in Tibet took the "sems" part to be something resembling Yogacāra idealism. 

ChNN's scheme is related to the three kāyas, so completely different in meaning.

To this we can add the explanation of byang chub sems found in Kunzang Dorje's 12th century text, the Vajra Bridge (klong sde). Byang refers to purity, that's obvious. But he states very clearly: 

Comprehension means (chub pa) means [6/b] 1) the comprehensions imbued with the five poisons when there is ignorance or delusion about the reality of the mind essence and 2) it means the comprehension imbued with the five pristine consciousnesses when there is knowledge and realization of that reality.  

One point that the gloss "perfect" does not reach as a translation is the the definition of chub pa as understanding or realization (rtogs pa). 

sems is explained as follows:

Next, because so-called “mind” (sems) is not the mind, it is the mind essence (sems nyid). The temporary concepts of mental processing arise from conditions and perish because of conditions. Being conditioned and relative, since [the mind] cannot endure and are transformed by conditions, [mind] is not ultimate. 

The mind essence (sems nyid) has always been unconditioned. The meaning of not being destroyed by conditions and never changing in the three times is the reality that is luminous and nonconceptual.


Dorje Gyaltsen's 13th century commentary on the Cuckoo of Vidyā gives the following definitions:

The meaning: “Purity [byang]” means all phenomena that are the primal nature (rang bzhin, prakṛti) of delusion have never been established in the core of the true state, bodhicitta [byang chub sems]. Also there is no purifying antidote, its intrinsic essence beyond thought and expression is pure. 

However all the phenomena of samsara and nirvana or the universe and beings appear, they are one in bodhicitta through the principle of being free from departing and gathering, and are inseparable. Since those are free from partiality, they are comprehended (chub) to be pure. 

That “Mind of” [kyi sems] is the unmixed totally complete essence, the primal nature of the eight consciousnesses endowed with a luminous (‘od gsal) identity which inherently never wavers into any extreme at all, free from all extremes, naturally pure and unwavering in the three times. 

Now then, if it is asked “Is it not impossible for such a pure primal nature to appear to the mind of a person?” It is possible, it is called “vidyā” (rig pa). The vidyā of migrating beings itself appears as the mental consciousness in terms of apprehending subjects and apprehended objects. When vidyā manifests its own primal nature, the mental consciousness manifests as self-originated wisdom, and then the pure basis of the mental consciousness (free from the root of apprehending subject and apprehended objects) bring samsara to an end. The pristine consciousness (ye shes, jñāna) of one’s vidyā (without root or leaf) — naturally perfected as it totally encompasses and subsumes everything — is the true state [de kho na nyid, tattva]. 

Thus, another way to translate byang chub sems is "The mind essence of the comprehension of purity."

This also why we distinguish byang chub sems and rig pa. The former is the object of the latter. 

This should clear up some questions and cause more.

In Buddhadharma, we study tenets to reduce concepts, not to enjoy their beauty of expression. 

Modern Western Philosophy, now largely divorced from soteriological concerns, is a beautiful edifice to the conceptual mind, but its meaning is coarse and shallow. 

As I mentioned above, the one place Western Phil might be able to add something to Buddhadharma is a more finely articulated theory of social justice, given that no such theory was ever enunciated in the days when all rulers were absolute rulers. Buddhists are discovering there are deficits in Buddhist discourse around social justice and so on, because the migration of Buddhism to democracies is still less than a hundred years old.

There is merit to a systematic project of translating the basic commentaries before the theg mchog mdzod. The TCD is invaluable for Longchenpa’s insights into the 17 tantras, but without Vimalamitra’s commentaries, much of what is alluded to in Longchenpa’s corpus remains obscure, and this is obvious in all the 7 treasures that have thus far been translated. For example, in order to elucidate points in the Tshig don mdzod, Khenpo Namdrol frequently refers to these commentaries. So as a matter of principle, i think my approach is more sound.

But now, with the translations of the commentaries of the Tantra Without Syllables and the Blazing  Lamp we are headed in the right direction.

The translations of the seventeen tantras absent their available commentaries are of limited valuu.

For example, nearly every line of the first chapter of the six dimensions tantra refers to specific practice, which is not apparent from the root text. Without the commentary one simply cannot understand the real meaning of the text. The same applies to the rest of the seventeen tantras

The same is true of humans (cloning), etc. The term “continuum” is a convention for a series of moments that observe morphological regularity, that’s all. But they too have no absolute identity. 

It is one thing to say a rock, which has no observable respiratory or metabolic functions, is insentient. It’s a little more difficult to say thus of plants and so on.

Unless plant intelligence operates according to principles which are alien to what we observe in animal intelligence. In other words, plants may be intelligent, but in a fashion distinct from the way we are intelligent, with different senses, different modes of communication, reproduction, memory, and so on. And, should this be the case, karma and so on would be irrelevant to plant intelligence, because of its utter difference.

Yes. And the fact remains that plant life, like all life, refines the five elements, demonstrates community, communication, interaction, altruistic behavior across species, as well as hostility, etc. One can claim it is all mechanistic, and insentient, but one can make the same argument about two and four-legged beings, I.e. that everything we do and are is merely a function of chemical interactions. 

The rebirth argument is not particularly convincing. So, in the end, Buddhists who insist on plantlife insentience are really just resting their arguments on passages from texts. That’s fine, but then, how does one pick and choose? Meru is false, but plant insentience is true?

The question everyone must ask themselves, is this: "I am interested mainly in the book or the person?" If the answer is the former, then even if one has the requisite transmissions, one should not attend. If the answer is the former, than one should attend by all means possible.

Direct introduction is a rig pa'i rtsal dbang, but there are many kinds, not only one. 

However, not all teachers will accept this as sufficient, this is why you must ask the organizers if it is sufficient. Some teachers consider a direct introduction to only apply to trekchod, not thogal. I am quite certain (since he is my teacher) that Khenpo Namdrol only wants people who have received empowerments like any of the four Nyinthig empowerments, the empowerments of the Gongpa Zangthal, Thigle Gyacan, Chetsun Nyinthig, the Rig pa'i rtsal dbang from Ye she Bla ma, and so on.

It really depends on where your interests lie. Pramana is not liberative. It concerns discerning veridical cognitions from false cognitions, conventionally speaking. One can analyze conventional phenomena endlessly, and still never ever come close to the taste of liberation. There is no doubt that modern logic is much more sophisticated than Dharmakirti’s seven treatises. So what? We don’t need pramana to attain liberation (hence Nagarjuna’s dismissal of pramana). It’s all a question of domain: transcendent or mundane. Buddhadharma concerns the former, and to the extent it is worthwhile and beneficial, can employ the latter, for example, pramana, medicine, grammar, and so on. But we should not confuse these two domains.

Here is another HHDL anecdote for you, 2005 Tucson, AZ, “When my Christian friends ask me about emptiness,I tell them it is none of their business.” 

In general, the Trad Buddhist view is that anything good in other religions is a result of bodhisattva activity, and of course, given rebirth, there is no doubt that bodhisattvas exist everywhere, even if they are, in that incarnation, not aware of their status as bodhisattvas. 

Nevertheless, we are talking about liberation from the kleshas that cause the actions which result in birth in samsara.  Don’t know about you, but I don’t spend much time reading things which don’t bear directly on this issue, much less speculate about them. YMMV.

Take it up with the Buddha:

"In whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, there is not found the Noble Eightfold Path, neither is there found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, or fourth degree of saintliness. But in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path, there is found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness.[54] Now in this Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, is found the Noble Eightfold Path; and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers. But if, Subhadda, the bhikkhus live righteously, the world will not be destitute of arahats."
https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... .vaji.html

The eightfold path begins, necessarily, with right view. 

And, no, there is no other means to overcome and destroy afflictions outside of Buddhadharma. It seems you could work a bit more on contemplating the eight freedoms and ten endowments that make up a precious human birth.

There is no "tantric" view of this. Some people interpret the samaya admonition not to criticize the Hinayāna as a blanket prohibition against critiquing any religion at all. Slagging off someone's religion out of spite is wrong, but offering criticisms of idiots like Hegel and so on, no problem.

"Lineage holders" are anyone who has received the transmission, does the retreats, etc. The main reason why these things remain in the hands of Tibetans is due to the lack of translation of empowerment manuals and so on into English.

So here, Amaro, draws an understandable, but erroneous conclusion, assuming that rigpa/vidyā referred to in Dzogchen is the mental factor of cognizance. Elsewhere, he refers to rig pa as intrinsic awareness (rang rig), understandably ignorant of the fact that rig pa, rang rig, and so on, in Dzogchen are contractions of so so rang rig pa'i ye shes, which is a very common term in Buddhist literature. If one claims that svasamvedana is what "rang rig" refers to, one's view does not transcend Yogacāra. This is an extremely common error, with consequences for one's practice. 

The difference between the nine yānas and the great perfection is that the former take mind as the basis; where as the great perfection takes gnosis as the basis. This has consequences for the path: the nine yānas are paths based on causes and results; path of Dzogchen is not based on causes and results. This also has consequences for the result. In the the nine yānas the three kāyas are a result that arise from the two accumulations; in Dzogchen, the three kāyas are path experiences and do not exist in the result.

Just look at how they arrange these things in a Shingon alter. No stupa, no text. 

For example, ChNN specified the only thing one really needs for a shrine is a picture of A in thigle of five colors, a candle for offering, and incense for dharmapālas, and this is enough for a formal shrine. If one like to do more, of course, one can. 

There is no one right way. So, it is sufficient for one's home shrine to simply have a picture of one's guru.

It shows patrimony. Also, if you read his bio, Kunga Drolchok was a Sakyapa. 

https://treasuryoflives.org/biographies ... TBRC_p2387

When two children have the same father, we consider them to be in the same family. No? 

Even Thukje Tsondru received most of his education at Sakya affiliated monasteries at the height the Sakya Hegemony. 

It's fine for the Jonangpas to consider themselves an independent lineage, but the fact is that they remained closely connected with the Sakya school for much of their existence. For example, Dakchen Dorjechang realized mahamudra by practicing the six limb yoga, but no one would call him a Jonangpa. The longest, most detailed commentary on Kalacakra was written by Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen who received the Jonang tradition. He wrote more on Kalacakra that any other single subject, but no one could consider him a Jonangpa. 

In those days, there were a number of smaller institutions that flourished, like Zhalu, Jonang, and so on. We can say that they are this or that instution, but when we examine things more clearly, their institutional identity as independent lineages is a function of the rising power of the Gelugpas more than anything else. They were either absorbed, like Nalendra, made a deal, like Sakya, Drikung, and so on, or were suppressed like Karma Kagyu and Jonang.

The source of this is the Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva (rDo rje sems dpa' snying gi me long). It cannot be ha, since ha is already present. Longchenpa, as I mentioned above, states in the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle that the syllable འ་ is from Oḍḍiyāna language, and so not Sanskrit. This is the same text where we find the translation of the Song of the Vajra. It is unlikely this is actually Longchenpa's own translation, considering the large swaths of material he cribs from the extant commentaries on the 17 tantras. It is likely from the now lost commentaries on the Union of the Sun and Moon Tantra.

Actually that was Longchenpa who presented a translation, which ChNN promulgated. But it’s not a 1:1 translation. And ChNN is the one who insists that Oddiyanese has grammar distinct from Sanskrit. 

And there is inconvenient presence of syllable འ, which has no correlate in Sanskrit, as I mentioned above. If anything, Oddiyana language would have been a Central Asian language at the border of Iranian and Indian language spheres. Several Dzogchen tantras and texts claim they are translated from multiple languages. How much credibility we can lend such assertions is a debate for text critical scholars. Other than texts like song of the vajra, we have almost no evidence of Oddiyana language, other than mentions of it as a language distinct from Sanskrit.

And no, there is no one alive who can offer much more than Longchenpa did. Having translated major portions of Dzogchen linguistic theory, it has no relationship to Pannini’s grammar. It’s quite unique.

Finally, it’s entirely certain that “Indic” title of the Kun byed rgyal po is fairly modern, since the KG bears considerable evidence of being a Tibetan compilation of earlier sources, and there is no mention of it before the 11th century, though it’s five core chapters are cited by Nubcheb, but it never is.

The title is a backtranslation. If you compare the titles in various versions of rnying ma rgyud “bum, you find wide discrepancies. The Derge version has replaced many of the earlier “Indic” titles found in the Tshams brag  reskin with back translations. The problem is that the often unintelligible Indic language version found in the latter collection is the one commented upon syllable by syllable. So, you really cannot trust the “Sanskrit” of these titles when examining them from the Derge version of the Nyingma canon.

In any case, Dzogchen tantras are held to been given in Oddiyana language, not Sanskrit. As Longchenpa points out, the འ syllable does not exist in Sanskrit, but according to him, does exist in the language of Oddiyana.

Abhisheka is a very precise term for a specific rite. It was the incorrect use of that word that prompted my initial comment. There are many kinds of transmission in Buddhadharma. But these two gentlemen regularly speak of such things in a very haphazard, irresponsible manner that is misleading. 

When speaking of how Dzogchen is transmitted, for example, as in sutra, the kind of transmission depends on the capacity of the practitioner. These issues are detailed precisely in various authoritative commentaries. It’s true that Dzogchen transmission does not need to be wrapped up in a complicated mandala ritual,  but it still has identifiable principles of transmission that have written about extensively, the most important of which are the teacher’s intent and the student’s receptivity. The teacher  must be able to and intend to give transmission and the student has to be receptive and proactive in receiving transmissions. The details depend on  a variety of factors. For example Manjushrimitra was a highly trained pandita as well as a Vajrayana practitioner already when he met Garab Dorje. Garab Dorje was a Indian child prodigy, a nirmanakaya. 

Especially when discussing the other Vajrayana systems, a formal set of ritual empowerments is essential. There are many reasons for this, not least of which is the assertion that the result, buddhahood depends on gathering the two accumulations.

'Od gsal lha are pre-buddhist. They cannot be Ābhāsvara devas since they belong to the desire realm. Indeed, the Khon clan identify a very specific mountain peak to the north of the Tsangpo river  as the site where the sky gods (gram aha) as they are also called descended in Tibet. The middle brother was called gYu ring, or Long Turquoise. His sons were the famous seven Ma sang brothers, which include the dharmapāla Vajrasadhu. The Ma sang are also credited with inventing divination and gambling with dice. The ancient Tibetan game of Pagchen is credited to them as well. In any case, it is impossible for form realm gods to descend to the desire realm, much less the human realm, and even if they were to do so, humans could not interact with them. There is a similar myth from the lCe clan, only in this case, the 'od gsal lha descend in Tajik, and conquered the humans there, before moving into Mang yul, Tibet via Zhang Zhung. 

Thus, these so-called gods from which these Tibetan clans claim descent are pre-buddhist classes of deities, and have nothing to with Indian cosmology at all.

Good question. The truth is that positive actions are also afflicted when they are not connected with path phenomena. Basically, all compounded phenomena are afflicted or conducive to affliction, which the exception of path phenomena. 

So it still applies that --&gt; affliction --&gt; karma --&gt; suffering --&gt;, since afflicted positive actions only lead to birth in higher realms, and not to liberation.

For example, when one perceives an enemy, the caitta of anger is produced, this colors cetana negatively, and one then engages in verbal and physical actions which aim to harm that enemy. Cetana is simply that mental factor that puts the mind's negative and positive qualities into action. That's is why the Buddha defined cetana, intention, as karma, action, in the Anguttara NIkaya, iii.415:

"Mental volition, O Bhikkhus, is what I call action (Kamma). Having volition, one acts by body, speech and thought."

It's important to remember that the conditions in Tibet, from which we inherit Vajrayāna in general, were quite different than in India. In India, Vajrayāna was small and isolated, and quite late in appearance. It was not some major populist Buddhist movement. It fled to Tibet for two reasons: money and institutional survival. 

In Tibet, as we know, Vajrayāna survived because it first was turned into a state religion, and then continuously supported by clans that had connections with the old Imperium after the assassination of Langdarma and the economic crisis precipitated in Asia by the 842 CE religious persecution of Buddhism in China by Emperor Wuzong. It was then revived by the Western Tibetan kings in the late 10th century, when Vajrayāna was imported again in Tibet, largely from Kashmir, Nepal, and Bengal, primarily. 

Tibetans will try to control the spread of Vajrayāna in the West, but they are already failing at that.

There are three ways, best to worst: signs, number, time. Usually time does not fill requirements to become a vajra master permitted to perform fire pujas, draw mandalas, and so on. Signs and number do. For example, the Hevajra retreat requires 400k of the main mantras (the root mantra has 144 syllables). Upon accomplishing this retreat, one is considered a vajra master. Most people do retreats based on number. Usually, the number should produce some signs. Since this is the Kali Yuga, where the tantras say 100k, this is usually multiplied by 4.

Do you think Garab Dorje gave Mañjuśrīmitra a ritual empowerment? 

Ritual empowerments are not necessary in Dzogchen, but it depends a bit on the capacity of the student. There are various levels of empowerment in Dzogchen, from elaborate rituals to very simple explanations. They are all considered "ripening empowerments." 

If you meet a master like ChNN, and he explains to you the meaning of Dzogchen teachings, using symbols and experiences, this is an empowerment. My other main teacher, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, use to give Dzogchen transmission on the basis of explaining the calling the guru from afar text he had written. Indeed, he used to tease us for asking him for this empowerment and that empowerment, calling this "the play of children." He clarified that the teacher is the empowerment. ChNN made a very similar point about his master, Changchub Dorje, saying that everything Changchub Dorje did was itself transmission. 

It is good for beginners to be a little formal, and so on. But don't get stuck on formality.

There are two kinds: mundane and transcendent. Even ChNN asserted he was not realized in the transcendent manner. He asserted the main difference between himself and his students is that he had a little better experience in dream yoga. 

In reality, realization is linked with cutting off rebirth in samsara. Are you someone who has properly understood Dzogchen teachings so you know with confidence that you are never going to take birth in samsara again? This is realized. But in lower yānas teachings, this means realizing the first stage. In Dzogchen, the criteria is functionally the same but does not require realization of emptiness. Nevertheless, we aim for realizing emptiness. 

In other respects, realization is measured by the ten fetters. Are you free from a view of self, esteeming vows and rituals, and have complete faith in the dharma? Then you can say you have some realization. A step down from that——do you have patience towards the arising of afflictions in your mind such that you do not act them out? Then this is also some realization. 

"Realization" does not mean rainbows shoot out of your ass.

An actual deed of killing, etc., is not confined to a single moment of intention. It is rather a series of moments of intention—from anticipating it, executing the deed, and then relishing in the satisfaction of having carried it out. Each of these moments of intention is a discrete karma, each with separate force and vipaka. Thus one deed of killing, made up of many actions, can have in many results. But each result is the ripening of an individual karma, and the case above, 500 individual throwing karmas.

Correct. But a given cause can only produce a single result. A cause expires upon the production of its result. This does not mean a seed is a sufficient cause of a sprout, but it is the necessary cause.  Sunlight, warmth, and moisture are also needed as conditions. But in absence of a seed, they won’t produce a sprout.

This also applies to a karma— a karma is exhausted when it produces its vipaka. But in order to produce its result, conditions necessarily come into play.

The first time a batch of students hit level 4, ChNN made everyone start all over again, from the beginning. Frankly, he was never really very satisfied with the progress of SMS students. After he made everyone start over, he instituted a "teacher training" of more limited scope. In the beginning it was quite serious, and people were expected to explain a random topic for an hour in front of the boss. By the end, however, it became much less serious, as demand for SMS teachers grew, and people were giving fifteen minute explanations for their exams. People often wonder why I never became an SMS teacher. I asked ChNN about it in 2002. His reply was that he expected SMS teachers to be 80% integrated and humble. 

There are good SMS teachers out there, like Steve Landsberg, Jacob Winkler, Costantino Albini, and so on. I encourage anyone to take teachings from them, and especially from Adriano Clemente and Fabio Andrico. These are just people I know personally, this does not mean there are no other good SMS teachers.

ChNN knew quite well Dzogchen Community was not going to survive without Western teachers. Originally, SMS was set up to train Dzogchen teachers, do a level, teach a level. His original idea was the when one reached the 4th level, one ought to be able to give direct introduction based on one's own experience and knowledge. It didn't pan out that way, but this was his original intention. 

Later he also knew quite well Dzogchen Community was going to split into different groups and factions, all claiming to represent his "authentic tradition," just as the Buddha's sangha split into different groups. 

ChNN's teachings will continue on, both inside and outside of Dzogchen Community proper, and in fact they will continue even when Dzogchen Community itself is just a dim memory. Longchenpa left no lasting community, but his teachings are spread everywhere there is Dzogchen. ChNN was a "second Vajrasattva," as his teachings will continue for as long as there are people to transmit them.

That depends on the capacity of the teacher. If they understand things correctly and are operating from the point of authentic knowledge of the teachings and the students have confidence, then everything can be done in a very simple way. But if the teacher has some doubts, or the student has doubts, than doing things in a more complicated way may be desirable. There is no fixed rule.

Candrakīrti asserts that it is. You can take it up with him. You are confusing what arhats and pratyekabuddhas realize with śrāvaka philosophical systems. Both arhats and pratyekabuddhas also realize the absence of inherent existence. There is no other emptiness apart from that, other than a bunch of designations: outer emptiness, inner emptiness, etc., etc.

For example, can you show me a single place in the Madhyamakakārika of Nāgārjuna where he discusses compassion? No, you cannot. 

If one wishes for full buddhahood, one must have Mahāyāna bodhicitta; but that is not required for arhatship. This why people are warned that even if their meditation of emptiness is perfect according to Mahāyāna philosophy, if they lack bodhicitta, they will not achieve anything other than the cessation realized by arhats. Nevertheless, such people are liberated, free of affliction, and so on. Not only this, but there is such a thing as nonafflictive ignorance, even some buddhas suffer from it, such as tenth stage bodhisattvas. The only beings who are completely free of nonafflictive ignorance are samyaksambuddhas.

The immediate problem here is assuming that every Vajrayāna practitioner is sufficiently ripened to benefit from such treatment and has sufficient faith in their teacher not to flee in terror. 

Some western students hear rumors of such antics by Tibetan teachers. They then develop a kind of machismo around tolerating such displays. All I can say is that all of my gurus have been unfailingly kind to all of their students, and never hit, abused, spat upon, yelled at, or beat up anyone. Tibetans have a culture where they tend to give the benefit of the doubt to the teacher. We do not have such a culture, and to the majority of westerners tolerating such behavior looks rather cultish on the face of it. Wise teachers adapt to circumstances. 

The adoption of unconventional behavior in India has a lengthy history, even by the 10th century. The Buddha recorded the behavior of ascetics during his day. Such unconventional behavior was well tolerated in the Indian context by the time of the Buddha. At first, the Tibetans were quite shocked by Indian siddhas and their behavior. Everyone forgets that Padmasambhava was not welcomed warmly by all Tibetans. There was considerable pushback to Padmasambhava by Tibetans as the more reliable early histories in which Padmasambhava is mentioned show. At this point, the person of Padmasambhava is lost in myth and legend, and the few contemporary historical glimpses we see of him the Old Tibetan Annals do not portray anything very remarkable.

By 1000 CE, the Tibetans had largely abandoned their old religion, of which only traces remain, and adopted Indian Tantric Buddhism completely, along with the magical wars siddhas were fighting with Hindus. We tend to view all of this anachronistically. But my point is, the notion of who a guru was and how he or she could treat students evolved in Tibetan society over a long period of time based on Indian antecedents. Indian Siddhas were the Marvel superheroes of Tibetan culture. We forget this, and we ought not. 

Even so, was also much suspicion of Indian "atsaras" in later times  as well. We have examples of Indian impersonating other more famous Indian teachers, for example, and the general suspicion of Nyingmapas of the time that many of the tantras being brought to Tibet from India were just composed by Indian pandits to rob naive Tibetan translations of gold, etc. But eventually, when the treasure tradition emerged to compete with the new Indian revelations, we see Padmasambhava's myth cycle absorbing the deeds and personas of such famed Indians as Brahmin Vararuci (aka Loden Choksre), etc., and so on.

Thus, when we see teachers bringing up examples of Tilopa and Naropa, Marpa and Milarepa, Do Khyentse and Patrul, we have to remember we are talking about events in cultures not our own, with signifiers which are almost completely alien to the West.

Yes, it means that a cause will persist beyond its result, produce a second result, ad infinitum. If a cause were to produce more than one result, those results would all have to happen simultaneously, for example a seed would have to produce more than one plant. You might argue, well, plants produce many seeds and that's an example of one cause producing many results. However, this is not the case. Plants are complex sets of causes and conditions, and any complex set of multiple causes and conditions can produce multiple results. But when you carefully examine you will see that the causes for each individual seed are exhausted when that seed is produced, etc.

I was actually referring to the Mahānidanasutta, but this will serve. The gandharava (lit. smell eater) is a technical term for a being in the intermediate period between this life and the next life. The Theravadins don't accept the Buddha's teachings on the gandharva. They assert that the moment one's stream of consciousness separates from the body of this life, it immediately appropriates the body of the next life. Other schools accept the Buddha's teaching of the gandharva and maintain that the gandharva goes through seven successive births in the intermediate state over a period of forty-nine days until it appropriates the body of the next life. The point is that in order for conception to occur, there must. be three things present: sperm, ovum, and a consciousness craving birth.

It’s not a question of belief in rebirth, but an acknowledgement that the existential question the Buddha sought to remedy was the question of rebirth. If the existential question of rebirth is discarded as irrelevant, Buddha’s solutions to that question are immediately irrelevant and moot. There is no point in calling oneself a Buddhist if one fails to acknowledge the central question the Buddha posed, “How does one end being reborn in samsara over and over again?”

This not the Buddha's teaching on karma, not even remotely. 

The way it is put in Abhidharma is this:

The variety of the world is due to action. 
Action is volition and what proceeds from volition. 

Because we act, we cause changes in and on the world. They are not natural unfoldings, if you will. All change in the world is due to the action of sentient beings. Even the formation of the universe is caused by the actions of all the sentient beings, ripening from the last universe to cause this on.

Karma (action) is intention/volition (cetana) and what proceeds from intention/volition. That is how the Buddha described it, as well as Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu. 

That is why it is "personal," as the ripening of these intentions will only take place on the same mind stream that generated them, and in the same realm as they were generated. In other words, actions in the desire realm will only ripen in the desire realm, and so on. 

Karma is not a law of cause and effect. Causes and effects are treated separately and before we get to karma. Actually, in Abhidharma it is presented very logically. Cause and effect are presented first, then dependent origination, then karma, and then afflictions.

Ok, well, you have to understand that everything in Crystal came from an early period in ChNN's career, when he was not teaching in English. At this time, he used various English translators such as John Shane, Barry Simmons, and so on, before ChNN switched over to teaching in English directly around 1988, the same year Crystal came out. So we cannot regard it as a definitive representation of ChNN's intent, since it is an edited transcript of translation from his original Italian. It broadly served as a introduction to his teachings, but was never intended to be a definitive statement of them. But more importantly, there is no such term in Dzogchen as "the fundamental ground of existence." The term "gzhi" refers to your own nature which you have failed to recognize. That's it. It is not a "ground of being" as in Paul Tillich's theology, where the term originates:

For Tillich, God is being-itself, not a being among other beings. To describe the relationship between being-itself and finite beings, Tillich takes the word, "ground." For Tillich, God is the ground of being, the ground of the structure of being. God as being itself is the ground of the ontological structure of being. In other words, every ontological being has its power to be in being itself, participate in the ground of being. All accounts of God are expressed through what we comprehend. Can we know God? For Tilich, the answer is clear: we can. Adopting the theory of analogia entis (analogy of being), that is, "that which is infinite is being itself and because everything participates in being itself" (239), The theory of analogia entis explains the possibility of knowing and saying anything about God. However, for Tillich, the analogia entis justifies our ways of saying about God only under a fact that "God must be understood as being itself" (240). Thus, existential approach to God through the category of finitude must be described symbolically. God is the ground of being, being-itself; who concerns us ultimately. Thus, God is our ultimate concern.
https://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/tillich.htm

There is no such ground of being in the whole length and breadth of buddhadharma, including Dzogchen teachings.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

So, you don't like the moderation policies of Twitter, then go to Truth Social, where you are forbidden to say anything negative about TFG. The government should not be involved in the policies of these private platforms where they do not break laws, such as laws against kiddie porn, etc.

Complaining about leftists being afraid of open debate is absurd nonsense. The fact is that all the serious conservatives abandoned MAGA world's obsession with bathrooms, testosterone, Qanon conspiracy theories, and so on, and still engage in serious debate with those on the left, as they should. 

Many of the debates that people on the far right want to have are basically a waste of time and energy.

No, it isn’t, though it’s true that our institutions have taken some hits recently. That just makes it all the more important to give a voice in support of it.

Elections don’t make a democracy. It’s how power is transferred that defines a democratic state.

What we understand today as "democracy" was forged in the fire of the American revolution. Essentially, all states have systems of transferring power. Democracy, like Monarchy, etc., is just one of those systems. It also happens to be the rarest form of government in history. One thing you will notice is that liberal democracies never invade or fight wars with other liberal democracies. Liberal democratic countries tend to stick together.

My argument is simple-- liberal democracy in general is the ideal government under which Dharma can flourish. That does not mean that we have to have elections in sanghas, etc. It just means that liberal democracies are places where Buddhists enjoy the most freedom. This is very clear when you examine the state of Buddhism in the world today.

Our country, like it or not, is the founding nation of modern, liberal democracy. The international language of Buddhism is now English, not the English of the Crown, but American English. 

Only 6.4 percent of the world population live in full democracies; that's only 21 countries and just over 500 million people. 66% of those people live in the USA, with the other 24 percent spread around the other 20 countries. The best chance Buddhism has is in these 21 countries, which have adopted the principles of liberal democracy, courtesy of the American Revolution. The vast majority of those democracies are less than 150 years old.

You have to read the article. Basically, he argues, correctly, that the bar was set so high in the nikaya and agama tradition that no one could have thought of themselves as bodhisattva until the advent of sutras like the Aṣṭasāhasrikā. However, this is obvious from traditional Mahāyāna accounts as well, where it is fully acknowledged that Mahāyāna sūtras only began to circulate hundreds of years after the Buddha's passing, having been gathered and arranged in S. India by Mañjuśrī, etc., and then "published." 

For example, he points out that the reason one knows one is an irreversible bodhisattva is that one when one hears a text like Aṣṭasāhasrikā, one is not afraid, one sheds tears upon the mention of emptiness, and so on. All these things occurred for me personally, when I first read the Aṣṭasāhasrikā. It moved me in a way that Nāgārjuna did not, though Nāgārjuna blew me away at 24 years of age and set me firmly on this path. Also Nāgārjuna points out in the Ratnavali that the agamas do not teach the bodhisattva path, well, because they do not. If one wants to follow the bodhisattva path, one must follow the Mahāyāna.

I dont know. I like Wedermyer as a person, having met him and shared drinks. He is smart. Drews (whom I never met) on the other hand is a bore, and comes up with stunning conclusions like this one:

Rather than being the product of a preexisting bodhisattva tradition, it thus seems most likely that Mahāyāna sūtras were responsible for bringing a bodhisattva tradition into existence for the first time.

Gender is an illusion, albeit, a powerful one: 

Śāriputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?

Goddess: Although I have sought my “female state” for these twelve years, I have not yet found it. Reverend Śāriputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, “What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”

Śāriputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?

Goddess: Just so, reverend Śāriputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think, “What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?”

Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Śāriputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, transformed into Śāriputra, said to Śāriputra, transformed into a goddess, “Reverend Śāriputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”

And Śāriputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, “I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!”

The goddess continued, “If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, ‘In all things, there is neither male nor female.’ ”

Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to his ordinary form. She then said to him, “Reverend Śāriputra, what have you done with your female form?”

84,000 dharma doors refers to 21,000 dharmas of vinaya, 21,000 dharmas of sūtra, 21,000 dharmas of abhidharma, and 21,000 mixed dharmas as antidotes for desire, anger, and ignorance, as well as mixed afflictions. 

From a Mahāyāna point of view, vinaya and abhidharma are provisional. According to Nāgārjuna, śrāvaka sūtras do not teach the bodhisattva path and the means to attain buddhahood. 

From the point of view of secret mantra, common Mahāyāna does not teach the path of attaining buddhahood in a single lifetime, soup to nuts.

Etc.
