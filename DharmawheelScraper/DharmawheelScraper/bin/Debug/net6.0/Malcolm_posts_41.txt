It is quite trivial to say that tathāgatagarbha is not empty of qualities but is empty of faults, because tathāgatagarbha is nothing other than natural luminosity of one's mind, which is to say that one's mind has always been innately pure from the start. This however does not mean that those famous qualities are real, established, ultimately exist and so on. Even Buddhas are not ultimately real, so how can their qualities be ultimately real?

Look, I don't go out of my way to negate gzhan stong, but as I have made clear, AFAIC, gzhan stong does not = tathagatagarbha doctrine. 

Gzhan stong is a Tibetan attempt, of several, to try and reconcile the Yogacara treatises of Maitreyanatha with Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka. 

It is not the case that this type of reconciliation was not attempted by Indians, it was, notably in Ratnakārashanti's Madhamaka-alaṃkara. 

The problem is how the Tibetans in the gzhan stong school went about it, not that they tried it. Ratnakārashanti, Dharmapāla before him, also tried to reconcile the two approaches, but they did not do so by overwriting the Yogacara treatises themselves. They did so within the constraints of the classical Yogacara system. What I specifically find fault with in the gzhan stong system is the incorrect way they apply the three natures to the two truths, that is really the essence of my disagreement with their tenet system and what causes them all the problems they face with other Tibetan scholars. Longchenpa does not do this, and this is why his treatment of tathāgatagarbha is generally considered more acceptable overall, as is Rangjung Dorje's.

There is only a difference in the coarseness or subtlety of the mind that apprehends suchness.

Sure, it is necessary for understanding much of Vajrayāna thinking around these issues. It is perhaps one of the most important theoretical commentaries on Vajrayāna, and its influence is much more widespread than the Arya tradition of Guhyasamaja.

Title: Re: Aeons and Aeons and Aeons

I don't see that passage as pointing out the nonconceptual wisdom of a bodhisattva and a tathāgata are the same.

It is not actually a very common term in the sūtras, occurring in only three sūtras in the bka' 'gyur. 

For example the term occurs only once in the whole the Prajñāpāramitā corpus, in the Ārya-candragarbha-prajñāpāramitā-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Son of a good family, in that respect, the inexhaustible perfection of discerning wisdom is the nonconceptual wisdom of the of path of seeing. Because that wisdom is free from all concepts, it is therefore nonconceptual.

It also occurs in the Ārya-avikalpa-praveśa-nāma-dhāraṇī and the Ārya-gośṛṅgavyākaraṇa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra. 

By contrast, it occurs in six tantras. Anyway, this is a besides the point. The real point is that the wisdom of bodhisattvas for example, cannot perceive tathāgatagarbha, even tenth stage bodhisattvas perceive only a generic approximation of it. The difference between the nonconceptual wisdom of bodhisattvas of one stage and another, as well as buddhas, is the degree to which they have developed sarvakārajñāna. 

When it comes to the difference between minds in sūtra and tantra, there are no means taught in the sūtras to quell coarse minds. For example, Caryāmelāpakapradīpa points out:

As such, the Mahāyāna sūtras explain that the nature of consciousness that is without color, signs or shape is self-knowing wisdom. On the other hand, without entering the mahāyoga tantras of Vajrayāna, such as Guhyasamaja and so on, one will not be able to understand one's mind just as it truly for all the eons equal with the sands of the Ganges river and will not see relative truth. Therefore, one may know just how the three consciousness truly are from the kindness of the guru through following the Śrī Jñānavajrasammucaya tantra.

If you wish to understand more about the distinction between the coarse mind taught in sūtra, and the subtle mind taught in the tantras, you should study Āryadeva's Lamp that Integrates the Practices, Wedemeyer, Columbia, 2007.

This, incidentally, is among the reasons sūtrayāna takes so damn long, i.e., outside of Vajrayāna, there are no methods access the most subtle mind and use it in practice. That at least is the point of view of Vajrayāna.

Well, one difference I see is the translation of this passage you refer to seems to be an abbreviation when compared with the same passage as translated into Tibetan:

“Mañjuśrī, how does a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva? [F.298.b] Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva does not think of destruction, arising, non-destruction, non-arising, and the utter destruction of destruction; nor is he disturbed by utter non-arising. It is in this way, Mañjuśrī, that he practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva does not practice by thinking, ‘The past mind is destroyed;’ he does not practice by thinking, ‘The future mind has yet to be obtained;’ he does not practice by thinking, ‘The present mind abides.’ He is not stuck in the past, future, or present mind. As he practices in this way, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. [136]

“Mañjuśrī, giving, awakening, and sentient beings and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata: these are non-dual, they are not divided into two.41 Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. Mañjuśrī, discipline, awakening, and sentient beings and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata: these are non-dual, they are not divided into two. Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva.
“It is the same way with forbearance, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata; diligence, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata; concentration, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata; and similarly, wisdom, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata. These are non-dual, they are not divided into two. Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva.

“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva may practice thinking that ‘form is not empty’ and also ‘not non-empty.’ Practicing in this way, Mañjuśrī, that bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. And why? He thinks, ‘Form itself is empty of the essence of form. In the same way, [F.299.a] feeling, notion, co-producing factors, and consciousness are empty.’ He practices thinking in this way and also thinking that ‘they are not non-empty.’ Practicing in this way, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. And why? Because mind, mentality, and consciousness are not perceived.

In Vajrayāna, no the ten stages are not absent. There are instead thirteen stages. 

In Kagyu Mahāmudra, the stages are not taken as seriously, also in Dzogchen they are not taken as seriously, but then again, these are systems belonging to Vajrayāna, an in each of these systems there are clear indications of how far along the path one is. 

In Kagyu Mahāmudra, there are various schemes, but the first two yogas are generally held to correspond to the two mundane paths and the path of seeing, the third yoga is the path of cultivation, and the fourth yoga, nonmeditation is equivalent to buddhahood. 

Likewise, in Dzogchen, the first two visions are below the path of seeing, the second two visions cover the path of seeing and beyond.

These historical interpretations of the Buddha's career have no relevance at all to Vajrayāna. The idea of dividing up the career of the Buddha into distinct epochs is a uniquely Chinese historiographical idea. The Indian Mahāyānis certainly didn't care about such interpretations and never made them, in fact they rejected them. 

As to the Chan point of view, this is addressed by Nubchen Sangye Yeshe. Chan lacks the direct introduction found exclusively in Vajrayāna, this is why he ranks Chan below Mahāyoga. 

As far as I am concerned, Chan sudden enlightenment is mere rhetoric and cannot be taken seriously. But I am sure if I were a Chan or a Zen practitioner, I would feel differently about it.

The point is that to attain full buddhahood it takes three asaṃkhyakalpas (asaṃkhya does not really mean incalculable, it is the name of a large number). The point of knowing where one is on the path is to know that, for example, if one is not yet on the path of seeing, one has a long way to go in common Mahāyāna terms. Even if one is on the path of seeing, one has a  long way to go in common Mahāyāna terms. 

For example, when it is says that bodhisattvas can attain full buddhahood in seven lifetimes, this is not referring to bodhisattva on the path of accumulation, it is referring to bodhisattvas on the eighth bhumi, etc.

    The Buddha praised Mañjuśrī, “Very good! Very good! You have so skillfully explained the meaning of this profound Dharma. You have long planted your roots of goodness under past Buddhas, training with purity in the Brahma way of life according to the dharma of no appearance.”

The Tibetan and Sanskrit make it more clear, the above refers to a thought that bodhisattva has, not an actual fact of his or her saving anyone. 

Subhuti, here, the one who has correctly entered into the bodhisattvayāna thinks in this way, "However many sentient beings there are, included in egg-birth, womb-birth, heat and moisture-birth and apparitional birth, with form, without form, with perception, without perception or without perception and non-perception, as many sentient beings as are designated sentient beings, all of them I will free through total nirvana in the state [dhātu] of nirvana without remaining aggregates. As such, though limitless sentient beings have been freed through total nirvana, no sentient beings will have been freed through parinivana." Thus that one should generate this thought.

Nondual has three main uses: Yogacara, Madhyamaka and Vajrayāna. 

In Yogacara is generally means the absence of subject and object. 
In Madhyamaka it generally means the absence of existence and nonexistence. 
In Vajrayāna it can also mean nondual conduct, where purity and impurity are disregarded, in addition to the both of the former two meanings.

Hi David, 

I think however, this is not how the Tibetan translators and their Indian informants split the term to come up with clear light ['od gsal]. I am fairly certain they split it the way I mentioned, taking svara as "clear":, from its primary meaning as tone, and prabhās meaning "light", hence the reason in Buddhist literature the frequent references to voices as "clear" in tone indicate by the alternate translation of prabhāsvara as gsal (prabhā) dbyangs (svara) translation of prabhāsvara.

We always have to keep in mind that Buddhist authors often depart from Paninian standards when etymologizing terms.

Everyone looks happy, and no one looks miserable. So? 

Successful centers require charisma, costumes/identities, and considerable interpersonal and organizational skills to run. I have seen very learned Lamas with zero qualifications in this regard who never ever have any students, so who are they benefitting? 

There are on the other hand a number of western (and also Tibetan) teachers with not much in the way of what I would consider even a barely adequate Dharma education, who nonetheless run very successful organizations with very satisfied customers/students. So? 

In the end, it is the students that make the teacher. It is important to keep this in mind.

These are experiences of a mind, not a cognizer itself, that should be obvious to you from the text. 

There are no attributes to grasp in luminosity. On the other, hand, if it is as you say, this is still not the rang bzhin 'od gsal, since that is clearly ultimate, and not a fleeting experience, the attachment to which results in a form realm rebirth. 

The fact that Tai Situ introduces the fact that it is the 'od gsal of rang rig proves that in this case. You elided rig in rang rig in your translation, in response I elided 'dzin pa. Perhaps what it should read is "the unobscured luminosity of a featureless apprehension." Read this way, it places luminosity as an adjective of rang rig, which is clearly how the Situ 8 sees it, rang rig 'od gsal, where 'od gsal is an adjective describing rang rig.

Title: Re: Natural Luminosity
Content:
Light = purity in the pre-modern mind. 

Natural luminosity [rang bzhin gyis od gsal ba], as very clearly stated in the citations above, is a description of the purity of all phenomena. I did not exclude citations that were somehow inconvenient to this definition. On the contrary, I sought for them and could not find them because they do not exist. 

Thus, to say that matter is naturally luminous is merely to say that it is ultimately pure. I am not sure why people are intent in ignoring the fact that the term "natural luminosity" is uniformly applied to all phenomena, all phenomena are naturally luminous, not only the mind. 

To be sure, the term 'od gsal by itself can and is often used merely to refer to lights shining from the Buddha's uṛṇa and so on, the quality of the light of a gem and so on. But in this context, we are not discussing the generic term "light", we are discussing a very specific term, [rang bzhin gyis od gsal ba], which is a technical term that has a very persistent usage across a broad swath of sūtras and tantras. 

Clarity [gsal ba] is the power of the mind to makes things evident. It is defined as the characteristic [lakṣana] of the mind, for example, in both Sakya Lamdre and Kagyu Mahāmudra. 

Luminosity [in this context] and clarity, 'od gsal ba and gsal ba, are therefore, really not the same thing at all. 

I very carefully looked for examples in the translations of Indian texts where gsal ba could be taken as an abbreviation of 'od gsal ba and was unable to find any at all. I have spent many hours engaged in this project. I also compared usages in available Sanskrit texts as well. Perhaps someone more skilled in Tibetan, in looking up citations, in reading them and in translating them, will be successful where I have failed. 

Further, as I showed already, luminosity and clarity are treated separately and distinctly in one of the main sources for understanding the so called union of clarity and emptiness, which I presented in the tantra above.

I did not present this post with an intention to have a lengthy debate about the issue. I selected a few representative quotes out of hundreds (to avoid stultifying repetition) in order to edify all of you. If you choose to be edified, that is fantastic. If you prefer to cling to your own ideas, that is just fine with me too.

At this point, having restated my point of view three or four times, I will leave it here unless someone has something of further value to add. Otherwise, I fear we are just going in circles.

Then we have to be very precise, don't we? For example, we have in the Ṥrī-jñānavajra-samuccaya-tantra this line:

Luminosity ['od gsal ba] is the ultimate truth. 

But we also have this verse in the same text:

If the two truths are separate, 
the path of wisdom is pointless. 
If clarity and emptiness ['gsal stong] are separate,
there will be falling into the extremes of permanence and annihilation.

Now, in case you are tempted to think that emptiness is relative, the same text clearly states:

Relative truth
is the moon in the water;
ulimate truth
is the eighteen emptinesses. 

Luminosity is clearly described here as ultimate. Clarity here is clearly described as relative, the apparent and evident aspect of the two truths, as we can further see:

From the relative clarity arises the woman, 
the bhaga, and the assembly of goddesses.

Or for example, in Indrabhuti's Śrī-cakrasaṃvaratantrarājaśambarasamuccaya-nāma-vṛitti, it is stated:

There is joy from the gradual blazing everywhere from the three channels; and in a moment of experience, samsara and nirvana arise as nondual clarity and emptiness.

In any case, clarity [gsal ba] is described as relative, samsara; while luminosity ['od gsal] is everywhere described as ultimate and nirvana; so how can gsal ba = 'od gsal? Clarity is relative and conditioned, luminosity is ultimate and unconditioned

Actually, what is being said is that space is pure, as the Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā states:

Due to the element of space being naturally luminous, it is pure and without afflictions. 

Vasubandhu echos this in the Āryākṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā:

Luminosity is natural because its nature is pure. 

And: 

Since so-called "luminosity" is free from the temporary taint of subject and object because there is no reification, it is explained as naturally pure. The concept that there is a subject and object is called "reification"; since there is no concept of the existence of subject and object, so-called "luminosity" means "the characteristic of natural purity."

And:

Since the obscurations of knowledge and affliction do not exist, the luminosity of discerning wisdom (prajñā) is explained as "the purity of discerning wisdom."

Bhavaviveka states in the Tarkajvala:

"Luminous clarity" is so called because of being free from the darkness of affliction and objects of knowledge.

Jayānanda states in the Madhyamakāvatāraṭīkā-nāma:

It says in sūtra that "Tathāgatagarbha" means "All sentient beings have tathāgatagarbha." That passage concerns tathāgatagarbha. "Natural luminosity" means that natural luminosity is immaculate. It's characteristic is what which is pure. "Pure from the start" meanings immaculate from the beginning like space. "Possessing the thirty two major marks means possessing the nature of emptiness.

And:

So called "luminosity" means the nature of emptiness is intrinsically pure.

Prajñamokṣa's Madhyamakopadeśa-nāma-vṛtti states:

Luminosity is natural purity.

I could go on citing Indian masters, but there is not much point.

Yes. For one thing, he is splitting the word at the wrong place, i.e. he splits it as prabhās/vara. 

The split is actually prabhā ['od]/svara [gsal ba], hence prabhāsvara. 

Prabhā means "light". svara primarily means "sound"; but also is the antonym of āsvara, indistinct, hence svara also has a meaning of "distinct". For example, the voice of a bodhisattva is described as prabhāsvara. If you look in the Sanskrit dictionary, you discover that prabhāsvara usually means "clear, shrill," but not in this case. When prabhāsvara is to be translated as "clear" as in a voice, it is rendered as gsal dbyangs, and not as 'od gsal. 

The other Sanskrit terms which gsal ba generally translates are uttānaḥ, to stretch or vyaktaḥ, "...caused to appear , manifested , apparent , visible , evident", and a number other terms as well which are not included in the Mahāvyutpatti.

Title: Natural Luminosity
Content:
The following is a comprehensive selection of citations from sūtra and tantra concerning natural luminosity [prakṛti prabhāsvara, rang gzhin gyis ‘od gsal]. It is by no means exhaustive, and I have not included any commentarial glosses by Indian scholars.
 
To understand natural luminosity, the first place to start is with the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. Most people are familiar with the famous statement:

There is no mind in the mind, but the mind is naturally luminous.

The Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā, beginning with matter, ending with omniscience and including everything in between, states:

Due to matter being naturally luminous, it is pure and non-afflicted…due to omniscience of all aspects being naturally luminous, it is pure and non-afflicted.

Ārya-suvikrāntavikrami-paripṛcchā-prajñāpāramitā-nirdeśa states:

It is thought, “This mind is naturally luminous.” As this was thought, it is thought, “The mind arises based on a perception.” Since that perception is totally understood, the mind does not arise and does not cease. Such a mind is luminous, non-afflicted, beautiful, totally pure. Since that mind dwells in nonarising, no phenomena at all arise or cease.

The Ārya-prajñāpāramitānayaśatapañcāśatikā states:

Since prajñāpāramitā is totally pure, all phenomena are naturally luminous. 


The Buddhāvataṃsaka-nāma-mahāvaipulya-sūtra states:

Since the original nature [prakriti] of the mind is luminous and endowed with purity, it is extremely pure…
The original nature [prakriti] of the mind is correctly known as peaceful, luminous and equivalent with space…
The natural luminosity of the dharmadhātu is abides as totality pure in the same way…

The Āryānantamukhapariśodhananirdeśaparivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Whatever is totally pure, that is an immaculate entryway, the mind is naturally luminous and never possesses afflictions. 
The Ārya-bodhisattvapiṭaka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
All these phenomena are naturally pure, 
naturally luminous, fundamentally pure from the start,
unfabricated and imperceptible. 

And:

If it is asked what is luminosity, that which is natural is without affliction, like space, the nature of space. Follow space. That which is equivalent with the extent of space itself is extremely luminous by nature. Therefore, the immature are temporarily afflicted because they do not comprehend natural luminosity. Since sentient beings do not know natural luminosity, they must comprehend natural luminosity…Due to understanding the natural luminosity of the mind just as it is, the unsurpassed perfected awakening through the discerning wisdom possessed by an instant of the mind is called “full buddhahood.”

The Ārya-lalitavistara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

I have obtained the ambrosia of Dharma,
profound, peaceful, immaculate, luminous and unconditioned. 
Even though I explain it, no one will understand, 
I think I will remain in the forest without speaking. 
Free from words, untrained by speech,
suchness, the nature of Dharma, is like space
free from the movements of mind and intellect, 
supreme, amazing, the sublime knowledge…
Always like space, 
nonconceptual, luminous,
the teaching without periphery or center
is expressed in this Dharmawheel. 
Free from existence and nonexistence,
beyond self and nonself, 
the teaching of natural nonarising
is expressed in this Dharmawheel…

The Ārya-sarvabuddhaviṣayāvatārajñānālokālaṃkāra-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Mañjuśrī, because the mind is naturally luminous, the secondary afflictions are exhausted by temporary secondary afflictions, but the primary afflictions do not exist by nature. Whatever is naturally luminous is without primary afflictions…
Mañjuśrī, awakening naturally luminous through the natural luminosity of the mind. If it is asked what is luminosity, whatever is natural is without the primary afflictions, is equal with space, has the nature of space and is included in space, and is like space because of being extremely luminous by nature. 

The Ārya-cintye-prabhāsa-nirdeśa-nāma-dharmaparyāya states:

The child asked, how shall I discern this? The mind is naturally luminous, within that afflictions are not produced and it does not become afflicted.”
The Bhagavān replied, “It is just as you have said. The mind is always luminous, the common people become afflicted by temporary afflictions."

The Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Purified of the afflictions
abandoned by meditation and seeing, 
the mind is naturally luminous,
the pure tathāgatagarbha;
but the addictions of sentient beings
are boundless and endless.
Just as when the surface of gold is polished, one sees
the gold color, the brilliant shine and the pure surface,
in just that way
is the sentient being in the aggregates.
The supreme ones have always shown 
the inexhaustible wisdom of the Buddha to be peace,
without a person, without the aggregates.
The natural luminosity of the mind
endowed with the affliction of mind and so on
along with [the affliction of] self
possesses temporary afflictions
from the start,
naturally luminosity can be purified of the affliction of self,
just like a [stained] cloth. 
Just as the flaws of either cloth or gold
can be cleansed because they are [intrinsically] stainless, 
which neither remain nor are destroyed, 
and likewise have the nature of being flawless. 

The Āryātajñāna-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Since all phenomena are naturally luminous, 
one should fully cultivate the perception of nonperception.

The Ārya-Śūraṃgamasamādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

All phenomena are naturally luminous,
those are not real entities. 
When something is a nonentity, 
that is the purity of phenomena.

The Ārya-pratyutpanna-buddhasaṃmukhāvasthitasamādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Also the mind is pure, naturally luminous,
unperturbed, all pervasive and unadulterated. 

And:

Since all these phenomena are naturally luminous, they are equivalent with nirvana. 

The Ārya-bodhisattvagocaropāyaviṣayavikurvitanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Due to not being asserted in other vehicles, the mind is pure. Due to the removal of the turbulence of the afflictions, the mind is not afflicted. Due to naturally luminosity, the mind is luminous.

The Ārya-tathāgatamahākaruṇānirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Due to the natural luminosity of the mind, awakening is naturally luminous. If it is asked why it is called “naturally luminous,” whatever is natural is without the afflictions, equivalent with space, the nature of space, and equal in extent with space, and even with space. That nature is very luminous. Since immature common people do not comprehend natural luminosity, they are afflicted by the afflictions…
The element of afflictions are fully known as the characteristics of the temporary afflictions. The element of purification is fully known as the characteristic of natural luminosity…
The natural luminosity of the mind should be known in just that way. Due to that, the Dharma of the existence of result is shown in one moment of mind. 

The Ārya-gaganagañjaparipṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Whoever skillfully realizes all phenomena as pure,
that is the natural luminosity of the mind…
Because the mind is naturally luminous, 
therefore it is never afflicted. 

There are of course many sūtra citations which I have excluded, but they all present a consistent theme.

Moving onto the tantras, we really do not find much variation on this theme, apart from the fact that the tantras tend to present a more precise explanation of the stages of the experience of luminosity in meditation (which will not be disclosed here). To begin with, the Ārya-ḍākinī-vajrapañjara-mahātantrarāja-kalpa-nāma states:

The dharmadhātu is luminous,
someone who meditates on that
is a sentient being who becomes equal with a buddha…
The dharmadhātu is luminous,
the taste of excellent bliss, 
called “the unobscured vajra.”

The Śrī-mahāsaṃvarodaya-tantrarāja-nāma states:

Natural luminosity
is beyond the range of analysis,
it is not low, not high, peaceful
it cannot be invoked,
it is inexpressible, beyond enumeration,
the aspect of emptiness
abiding as the nature all entities, 
free from all qualities such as sound and so on, 
this is the sources of the bliss of buddhahood. 

The Saṃpūṭi-nāma-mahātantra states:

Natural luminosity is free from all concepts,
free from being covered by the taints of desire and so on, 
with subject and object, the supreme being
has said that is supreme nirvana…
all phenomena are naturally luminous, 
because all phenomena do not arise from the start, 
it is termed non-origination by the mind. 

The Mahāmāyā-tantra-nāma states:

All phenomena are naturally luminous, 
pure from the start and without perturbation…
All phenomena are naturally luminous, 
pure from the start, like space.

The Śrī-vajramālābhidhānamahāyogatantra-sarvatantrahṛdaya-rahasyavibhaṅga-iti states:

Natural luminosity is stainless, 
free from all aspects. 

The Sandhivyākaraṇa-nāma-tantra states:

This phenomena is naturally luminous,
since it is pure from the start, it is equivalent with space,
there is no awakening, no realization,
it is the explanation of bodhicitta.

The Māyājāla-mahātantrarāja-nāma states:

All phenomena are naturally luminous, 
pure from the start, without perturbation,
without sentient beings, without life, 
without buddhas and without awakening. 


The Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Also everything is naturally luminous,
pure from the start, like space,
neither a phenomena nor a nonphenomena, 
inconceivable and delightful…
All phenomena are naturally luminous,
intrinsically pure from the start. 

The Vajraśikharamahāguhyayoga-tantra states:

Since everything is naturally luminous, 
its nature will be pure from the start, 
afflictions will not be perceptible, 
there will also be no liberation of nirvana…
All phenomena are nonarising, 
totally luminous, peaceful from the start. 

The Sarvarahasyo-nāma-tantrarājā states:

To explain the meaning of “sentient beings:”
the mind is naturally luminous…
whatever is naturally luminous
is unsurpassed bodhicitta. 

The Śrī-paramādya-nāma-mahāyānakalparājā states:

 Since prajñānapāramita is totally pure, all phenomena are naturally luminous. 

The Ārya-guhyamaṇitilaka-nāma-sūtra states:

All conditioned things are impermanent, and never arose from the beginning in natural luminosity. 

The Ārya-vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka-mahātantra states:

The wisdom free from concepts
is the actual buddhahood of all the past victors, 
that freedom from concepts
is demonstrated as the accomplishment of Secret Mantra. 
The result of that is pure,
naturally luminosity.
Whoever dwells in conceptuality
will never produce siddhis.

The Śrī-jñānavajrasamuccaya states:

Whatever arises from luminosity, 
that is called “mind,” “intellect" and “consciousness,”
that is the foundation of all phenomena,
the two stages are realized from
affliction and purification…
In order to explain the reality of all phenomena [gnas lugs], whatever arises from luminosity is dharmatā, the dhātu of naturally pure luminosity. Since a nonconceptual knowing awareness arises at the same time as the subtle vāyu, the mind [citta, sems] is the basis of all…
The reality of that inner consciousness,
nonconceptual innate dharmatā,
is the nature of luminosity, empty and not a self…
The reality of luminosity
is an unfabricated mind which arises from it
different from generic consciousness…
luminosity is the ultimate truth…
based on luminosity, the ultimate true state,
the path is traversed rapidly…
luminosity is dharmatā, suchness,
pure like space, great bliss,
unceasing, immaculate, peace,
ultimate, mahāmudra itself.
Mahāmudra of union
is attained from luminosity that is very free from proliferation…
Natural luminosity is totally pure, 
immaculate, like the element of space…


So, in the end we can see here that luminosity is uniformly considered to be a metaphor for the purity of both mind and phenomena. It is the critical point of meditation in Mahāyāna Buddhism, in both sūtra and tantra, and its experiential recognition leads in both cases to the realization of the final result, buddhahood. I have not included any citations from either sūtra and tantra which indicate how it is experientially entered, as that is beyond the scope of this post. 

Finally, we can also see here in these citations that the naturally luminosity of the mind what is being termed tathāgatagarbha, dharmadhātu, and so on, and we can see that it is also termed emptiness, suchness, dharmatā and so on.

In any event, in the huge plethora of citations I found, there are three main adjectives for 'od gsal [prabhasvara]: purity, stainless and nonafflicted. The main metaphor for 'od gsal is space; it is identified with emptiness; and it is defined as non-arising.

The purified ālayavijn̄āna is the mirror-like wisdom, i.e. the dharmakāya; the purified afflicted mind [kliṣṭamanas] is the wisdom of uniformity; the purified mental consciousness is the individually discriminating wisdom, i.e. the sambhogakāya...etc.]

And yet the ālayavijñāna is also conditioned and momentary; so since you have admitted the equation tathāgatagarbha = the ālayavijñāna, you have admitted the tathāgatagarbha is conditioned. It is simple logic. 

The alāyavijñāna is conditioned, 
the tathāgatagarbha is the ālayavijñāna
therefore, the tathāgatagarbha is conditioned. 

The mind is also pure, inherently, it is also conditioned inherently; purity and being conditioned are not mutually exclusive.

Buddhahood is a subtractive process; it means removing, gradually, obscurations of affliction and obscurations of knowledge. Since wisdom burns these obscurations away, in the end they have no causes for returning; and further, the causes for buddhahood are permanent leading to a permanent result.

Well, there is this, from your favorite sūtra:

The tathāgatagarbha is the tathāgatas' wisdom of emptiness. The tathāgatagarbha has not been previously seen by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas nor realized. 

This brings up what is this wisdom of emptiness? You have mentioned this emptiness before, but it is not exactly the extrinsic emptiness you imagine. Your presentation of these two emptiness suggests that not only the buddhadharmas but indeed the wisdoms too are innate to tathāgatagarbha, but a close reading of the Tibetan translation of this text does not support this idea:

Bhavagan, this wisdom of the emptiness of the tathāgatagarbha is of two kinds. If it is asked which two?, since the tathāgatagarbha abides as separate from the sheath of all afflictions, it is empty of the wisdoms because it has not been freed. Bhagavan, since the tathāgatagarbha does not exist separate from the buddhadharmas, by freeing it inconceivable wisdoms beyond the sands of the Ganges are attained.

To add to my post above, Jñānavajra writes in the Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-nāma-mahāyānasūtra-vṛtti-tathāgata-hṛdayālaṃkāra-nāma:

The tathāgatagarbha is the dharmatā of the mind free from proliferation and luminous; that [dharmatā of the mind] is the stage of buddhahood.

Then of course one has to deal with the fact that ālayavijñāna is frequently termed "tathāgatagarbha." Here, one cannot use the excuse that the Lanka is provisional, since it is clear included in the third turning sūtras by those who choose to interpret sūtras in this way.

One, the Indian scholastics belonging to the Madhyamaka and Yogacara strains did not really pay much attention to this idea or this class of sūtras. There exists but a single commentary and subcommentary on the tathāgarbhasūtras, the Ratnagotravibhaga, aka, the Uttaratantra (a title in all probability derived from the Nirvana Sūtra, which describes itself as such). 

Most of the Tibetan scholastics around the issue arise from the Tibetan desire to reconcile the five treatises of Maitreyanatha with Madhyamaka. 

In so far as tathagatagarbha being analogous to the notion of atman, it is simply another example of Buddhist expropriation and redefinition, so that now "ātman", in these sūtras, represents the potential to become a Tathāgata, which all sentient beings possess, the seed of buddhahood, as the Nirvana Sūtra so clearly states. 

In any case, the idea is far more important outside of India than it was in India. We should take that into consideration. It was also far more important to later Indian Buddhists (Vajrayāna) than to earlier ones (common Mahāyāna), and that also needs to be taken into consideration. We can understand this is a fact due to the increasing attention it receives in Vajrayāna commentaries. Whereas earlier Indian Buddhists wrote voluminous commentaries on the Prajñāpāramita with the Abhisamaya-ālaṃkara literature, on Yogacara with literature on the Mahāyāna Sutra-ālaṃkara and so on, they virtually neglect the Uttaratantra. However, there is another important text which can give us some alternate insight into this doctrine as it was understood in India, and that is the Āryalaṅkāvatāra-vṛtti by Jñānaśrībhadra. I cannot reproduce all 47+ comments he makes on tathagatagarbha in this text, but this one should give you an indication of what Indians in general understood tathagatagarbha to mean. They generally understood tathāgatagarbha as a synonym for the mind's natural luminosity:

Therefore, that dharmatā of the mind that is being examined [with regard to being] conditioned and unconditioned has always existed; because all sentient beings are possessors of tathāgatagarbha, these vessels of natural luminosity (prakṛtiprabhāsvara) are neither pure nor impure. Because they have spoiled that natural total purity, by abandoning the temporary flaws that the form of two arisisings, they are like gold, i.e., for that reason through category of permanence the tathāgatas are like precious gold. 

Indeed the Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra treats this metaphor in the following way:

Just as one sees the golden color, 
the natural shine and pure surface
when gold is polished, likewise
are sentient beings in the aggregates.

So here, of we want to apply the term nature (atman) to sentient beings, we can say that the nature (atman) of sentient beings is luminosity. But luminosity is just a metaphor for purity. For example, we see in the Ārya-bodhisattvapiṭaka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

All phenomena are naturally pure,
natural luminosity has always been the pure foundation, 
unfabricated and unperceived. 

And also:

The kāya of the Tathāgata is natually pure, totally pure, free from the taints of all afflictions. 

To illustrate this further, the Ārya-sarvabuddhaviṣayāvatārajñānālokālaṃkāra-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states very clearly:

Mañjuśrī, awakening (bodhi) is natural luminosity because of the natural luminosity of the mind itself. If it is asked for what reason is it luminous?, that which natural is totally without afflictions, equal with space, possessing the nature of space, truly inclusive of space and like space, because it is extremely luminous by nature. 

And of course the Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra clearly makes the equation between the naturally luminosity of the mind and the tathāgatagarbha:

Having purified the the afflictions
abandoned by cultivation and seeing,
the mind is natural luminous, 
the pure tathāgatagarbha.


It is also says:

The mind free of turbidty
is the opposite of the mental consciousness;
in order to understand all Dharmas, 
I have explained "The mind is the Buddha."

Now, if someone is going to assert the tathātagarbha is a self, they will also have to assert that the mind (citta) is a self. Then they will find themselves on a very slippery slope. But if, on the other hand, they assert merely that innate purity of the mind is all that is intended by tathāgatagarbha, then of course they will remain on level ground with no danger of falling in the ravine of permanence and annihilation. And perhaps it is needless to say, but this luminosity is only universal in the sense that it is a characteristic of everyone's mind, like heat in fire or wetness in water.

"Cessation" simply means an absence of causes for a future arising. There are two kinds, cessation due to analysis and non-analytical cessation. The former is a result of the path, the latter is simple absence of causation. Asserting that nirvana is a cessation is not annihilationism. Of course nirvana is a cessation, it is the cessation of the afflictions. Cessation is not an absence of being. An absence of being requires a being that is absent. There is no absent being in cessation.

This passage merely indicates that sometimes Buddha taught there is no self, other times he taught there was a self, as an antidote to different extremes. It is not the case however that this passage is claiming there is an actual self that is real, permanent, and so on. The Nirvana sutra states, as mentioned before:

When it is explained that the tathāgatgarbha is empty, the immature cultivate an incorrect fear; the intelligent know permanence, stability and immutability to be illusory. 

Also the idea that tathāgatagarbha is full-fledged buddhahood is contradicted by this passage:

The seed existing in oneself that turns into buddhahood is called "tathāgatgarbha," the buddhahood which one will obtain.

Or:

When the Tathāgata explains to the bhikṣus and bhikṣunis that his body is afflicted with a limitless great illness, at that time it should be understood that absence of self is being explained, and one should cultivate the meditation of selflessness. When the Tathāgata explains liberation is signless, empty and nothing at all, at that time one should understand the explanation that liberation is free from the 25 existences, and therefore it is called emptiness. Why?, since there is no suffering, there isn't any suffering at all, it is supreme bliss and signless. Why?, since that [suffering] is not permanent, not stable and not immutable, and because the nature of peace is not nonexistent, therefore, liberation is permanent, stable, immutable and peaceful, that is the Tathāgata. When the Tathāgata explains that the tathāgatagarbha exists sentient beings, at that time, one must correctly cultivate the meditation of permanence. 

So really, it is not necessary reify liberation as a self, though some people may find it temporarily useful. But in the above statement there is no reason to reify an entity. Being free from the 25 or three realms does not mean that there is some entity outside of or apart from the three realms. A self either a) exists in the three realms, b) or it does not exist at all, or c) is just a philosophical abstraction used to describe the permanence of liberation when it is attained, and the permanent potential one has to be liberated.

Hodge states that Yamamoto's translation on the whole is unreliable:

https://web.archive.org/web/20131219063 ... e_MPNS.pdf

As problems I notice, problems arise when the Indian Dharmakshema's Chinese translation of the long sūtra from Sanskrit [?] (translated into Tibetan by one Chinese monk, Wang-phab-zhwun; and two Tibetans, Dge-ba'i-blo-gros and Rgya-mtsho'i-sde) in fourteen chapters is compared against the Tibetan translation from Sanskrit text in five chapters and 3900 ślokas made by two Indian masters, Jinamitra and Jñānagarbha and one Tibetan translator, Devacandra.

Generally speaking, the Faxian's translation and Tibetan translation made by Jinamitra and Jñānagarbha and Devacandra are the same basic text. Dharmakshema's translation appears to be supplemented with extra texts. Hodges' account is really very interesting. In his view, everything not included in the Indian recension which is reflected by the Faxian translation and the Tibetan translation by Jinamitra and Jñānagarbha and Devacandra is entirely spurious and was composed by Dharmakshema himself, in other words, everything subsequent to chapter five (In the Yamamoto translation, chapters 1-17 corresponds with the five chapters found in the "short version).

Yes, it is synonym for atman in the sense that atman is used to describe a nature, rather than an personal identity. The atman of persons and things is anātman. In the Nirvana sūtra, after describing atman in terms like tattva, nitya, etc., he also describes it as the natural great emptiness [rang zhing gyis stong pa chen po] Form this passage we can see his intent:

One must know that the teaching of the Buddha is "this is the middle way." The Bhagavān Buddha teaches the path as the middle way that is free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation. Some fools however, confused about the Buddha's teaching, like those with weak digestive heat who consume butter, quickly come to have views about the two extremes. Though existence is not established, also nonexistence is not established. 

When the Buddha, in the Nirvana Sutra, discusses atman in personal terms, he very clearly states he only intends that there is a conventional self; when however he speaks of the self of phenomena, it is very clear by this that he intends emptiness as the "self" of phenomena.

Yes, as David notes, it occurs in one spot in the text where, according to the commentary brahaman [tshangs pa dam pa] is used ironically as a term for the nirvana which is not realized by Braham, Vishnu, Shiva, etc. On the other hand, one must also take into consideration Bhavaviveka's rejection of the equation parātman = dharmakāya. Considering that parātman and brahman are universally equated in Advaita and Vedanta in general, we must here understand that Bhavaviveka is making fun of the Trimurti, since he contrasts their non-realization of nirvana with the realization of Avalokiteśvara, Maitreya, Samantabhadra and so on in the subsequent part of the passage.

So you apparently did not read the direct citation I presented the other day where Bhavaviveka explicitly rejects this? 

From the commentary on Bhavaviveka's Madhayamakahridaya, the Tarkajvala.

If it is asked what is difference between this dharmakāya and the paramātma [bdag pa dam pa] asserted in such ways as nonconceptual, permanent and unchanging, that [paramātma] they explain as subtle because it possesses the quality of subtly, is explained as gross because it possesses the quality of grossness, as unique because it possess the quality of uniqueness and as pervading near and far because it goes everywhere. The dharmakāya on the other hand is neither subtle nor gross, is not unique, is not near and is not far because it is not a possessor of said qualities and because it does not exist in a place. 

And from his introduction to the Sanskrit text:

The tenets of Vedanta and Mimarpsa are stated and rejected in two chapters full of interesting information from the doxographical point of view. pg. xxix https://www.scribd.com/doc/208431986/Li ... -of-Bhavya

And for Lindnter's contention MH 1: 1-5 merely says:

tattvajñānaiṣaṇā ceti caryā sarvārthasiddhaye ||5||

bodhicittaṃ mahāmaitrīkaruṇājñānabhūṣaṇam |

There is no mention of either dharmatā or brahman in this passage. Thus you are following Lindtner in a huge leap which is totally unjustified when we examine the commentary:

Following that, with an unbiased mind, I shall endeavor to know the truth [tattvajñāna] which does not contradict reason and scripture through an examination of all textual systems...

This is hardly a proclamation that he [Bhavya] regards brahman to be an equivalent of dharmatā. Honestly, sometimes I think you people are like children in the woods eating berries without knowing whether they are poisonous or not, merely because they look pretty.

What he is saying is that since the Buddha does not actively refute a concept found in the Upanishads, he upheld it. But this is unreasonable. One, the Buddha rejects the idea of an "all" outside of the fields of the six senses gates. Two, the Buddha clearly rejects a person apart from aggregates. Three, later Mahāyanis like Bhavaviveka explicitly reject such equations as Brahman = dharmakāya and so on. Four, the Buddha is clearly aware of Saṃkhya and rejected it., etc., etc. 

Claiming "subtlety" as an argument won't work merely because one cannot present a rational for Bhattacararya's arguments beyond the fact that he made them. 

Pluse we have the evidence of 25 centuries of awakened Buddhist masters, not one of whom ever proclaimed that there was no essential difference in meaning between Vedanta and Buddhadharma, quite the opposite.

It is not a glaring omission at all. 

In any case, [apart from Chinese Buddhism, in which the doctrine of self has tragically reasserted itself like weeds in a garden left untended] there is a solid textual and instruction lineage tradition dating from the time of Ashoka to the present day which asserts that the teaching of the Buddha is in essence nairatmya, The trend of Buddhism called Pudgalavada was popular indeed, but it was never a transcendent self they asserted, merely an "inexpressible" self that was neither the same as nor different than the aggregates (which Vasubandhu polishes off very nicely in the refutation of the pudgala).

People who think they can ferret out the Buddha's meaning through textual analysis are very sad. Buddhadharma is, and always has been from the beginning an oral exegesis tradition, without which one cannot understand its doctrines.

Then of course, the Buddha refutes Samkhya, Vaiśeṣikaḥ Paśupatis, and so in the Lanka. One can hardly account for such refutations if one upholds the Buddha maintained a purusha like the Samkhyas, etc.

Why would the Buddha negate a self which is wholly unrelated to a person? Such an abstract self bears no need for negation because no thinking person would imagine that there was such a self that was somehow separate from their body or mind. The Buddha would be horribly inept to refute something that was totally without any basis. If the point of the Buddha's teaching was to identify some supreme self, why did he not merely come out and say so? It is not like the Buddha was a cagey gambler who kept is cards close to his chest. 

Indeed, in the Sutta Nipatta, the Buddha is reported to have said of arhats, that when someone goes out, attains nirvana, there is nothing left by virtue of which their nonexistence can be discussed. 

The continuing abstraction of the ultimate self in Hinduism is just a result of the continued and persistent  Buddhist negation of any such entity. There is also the fact that Hindu opponents of Buddhism continually castigate Buddhists for nihilism. How can so many centuries of Buddhists have gotten it so wrong. Why are there no awakened Buddhists returning to tell us how wrong we all have it?

Well, some gzhan stong pas might erroneously hold this view, but it is not the view of Dzogchen. In point of fact, the Rig pa rang shar tantra, one of the most important tantras on Dzogchen explicitly rejects Shankara's views by name, as well as those of Kumarila. 

Anway, the view of Dzogchen is that wisdom arises from prajñā, as the Rig pa rang shar also states:

All phenomena arise from within
the self-originated wisdom (prajñā) that is not a phenomenon. 
Pristine consciousness (jñāna) arises from that. 

To go into how that prajñā self originates is a little beyond our scope, but suffice to say it arises on the basis of a stirring of a vāyu which propels a jnāta which is neutral; and when this jñāta knows its appearances as its own state, it becomes a self-originated prajñā, self-originated because its knowledge of its own state did not come from outside, not because it is something that just pops into existence all of a sudden. And needless to say, if this same jnāta does not recognize its own state, it becomes avidyā.

It does get to the point where people have to either put up or shut up. Otherwise, it is like arguing about who should have won the 1939 world series.

They are not positive uses. They do not occur in the Uttaratantra itself. Asanga basically states that "supreme self" is the negation of the extremes of self proposed by tīrthikas (meaning all of them) and the nonself proposed by the śravakas. 

Some people seem to have this strange idea that when Buddhists refute tīrthikas, somehow there is a special class of tīrthikas that are excluded from this thorough refutation —&nbsp;as if Buddhists were not somehow aware of the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras and so on.

I did not disparage Nyingma, I just pointed out what is obvious to anyone who spends time reading Dzogchen tantras, i.e., that Dzogchen tantras themselves spends reams of paper criticizing lower yanas, and then successively, upper levels of ati criticize the lower levels of ati yoga until we get to yangti, where it seems that the triumphalism peters out since there is nothing else to say. Well, that is until some westerner invents: 

Ati lite™ New and Improved! With more flavors than ever! 

Then you wind up like some people do (not referring to anyone here), not doing anything at all because they think Dzogchen is not about doing anything, lost in a net of proliferation. 

If we are honest with ourselves, we will recognize that the likely hood of any of us attaining the ultimate fruits of any of these systems that we hold up as the bee's knees in this lifetime is very small. Maybe some of us will attain realization in the bardo. But rainbow body? In this life? Among we here who are posting now? I don't think so. And that is not a criticism of any lineage. So you have to take my criticisms for what they are, antidotes to what I perceive as rhetorical excesses. Have I committed my own fair share? Of course, its the internet. I understand the impulse to praise what one is into. Are Dzogchen teachings amazing? Sure. Is Lamdre amazing? Sure. Is Naro Chodrug amazing? Absolutely, Sadanga yoga and Kalacakra? Of course, etc., etc.

For this reason, it is a little strange to say that oh this teachings is more experiential than that teaching. All teachings are experiential, as are all empowerments. 

As far as obstacles go, well, Virupa's advice is to take the obstacles as the attainments, and the faults as the qualities. This of course does not mean that we should be crazy people.

In my opinion, people over play the "madness" element in Vajrayāna, not understanding the different levels of the path and when it is appropriate to engage in this or that conduct and when it is not. Conduct is a reflection of realization, not obstacles. There is a vast difference between someone who is merely behaving like Vajryāna hot mess and someone's whose conduct is a result realizing heat....

I have come to the point where I really do not see any lineage as being better than any other. It is not about the lineage, it is about the practitioner. 

Give a dog Dzogchen introduction and he will still be a dog. He may be a "Dzogchen" dog, but he will still bark, pee on fire hydrants, chase cats and fetch sticks. Give him Mahamudra instruction, and he may be a "Mahamudra" dog, but he will still bark, pee on fire hydrants, chase cats and fetch sticks., etc.

People talk about their lineages all the time, "I have this powerful teachings, it is so fast, it is so quick, it is so deep, it is so x...", but if at the end of the day they behave like schmucks, so what? I know so many people who have received every level of Dzogchen teaching, and they have not changed one little bit. They still behave like immature children, doing nothing but causing themselves and others headaches and trouble. I know people who only recite the mani, and watch them grow nicer and more mature everyday. I see many people posturing in their tantric garb, very elegant, who have no concentration and less mantra power, who become angry over the smallest slight, accusing everyone who disagrees with them of being samaya breakers. 

I think in this day and age, focusing on blessings as a substitute for practice is disease we've contracted from Tibetans, so naturally no blessing arise from our practice. I think that in this day and age substituting devotion for understanding is a disease we have contracted from Tibetans, so naturally no understanding arises from our devotion. In reality blessings arise from practice, and devotion arises from understanding, not the other way around. 

Really, we live in degenerate times.

The three own natures are mapped onto the two truths in the following way:

Ultimate truth = the perfected nature (parinispanna)
Correct relative truth  =  the dependent nature (paratantra)
False relative truth = the imagined nature (parikalpita)

Ultimate truth, parinispanna, is held to be empty of the dependent and the relative. According to this system in general, whatever is held to be ultimate is unconditioned, permanent and so on, and is empty of the conditioned, impermanent and so on. 

So, it is a very dualistic perspective in many regards, positing all kinds of dualisms such as empty/not-empty; impermanent/permanent; conditioned/unconditioned; and so on. 

In reality, according to the Maitreya, Asanga and Vasubandhu's treatises, the perfected nature is merely the absence of the imagined in the dependent nature. So, the two truths theory does not really work well if you try to map it to the three own natures as they are explained by the three great Yogacara masters. 

If you understand the dependent nature as the union of the two truths — in this case the imagined is the relative truth; the perfected, the ultimate truth; which corresponds to Candrakirti's observation that all things bear two natures, one relative, one ultimate. However, there is no classical presentation like this anywhere, AFAIK, and definitely not within gzhan stong.

Second of all, the reason why Gelug view leans towards nihilism is the insistence that ultimate is merely "the emptiness that is the absence of true existence in things". Hence they assert the ultimate is a mere nonexistence, and that leans towards ucchedavada.

The problem with gzhan stong really is not the idea that tathāgatagarbha is empty of adventitious afflictions. The problem with gzhan stong is the idea that these infinite wonderful qualities are somehow truly existent and not themselves empty (among other things0

The emptiness of other, the emptiness that is not empty, as the Nirvana sutra puts its, is not the profound emptiness of freedom from extremes. It is not more profound than the emptiness taught in the Cullasuññata sutta where the Buddha says a village is empty of a city because the people are not there. etc. Also the Buddha repeats this emptiness example in the Nirvana Sutra. 

However the Buddha also teaches profound emptiness in the Nirvana Sutra (Sanskrit recension translated into Tibetan). It is important to know the difference between the trivial emptiness of the so called affirming negation the emptiness of free of extremes. 

One must know that the teaching of the Buddha is "this is the middle way." The Bhagavān Buddha teaches the path as the middle way that is free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation. Some fools however, confused about the Buddha's teaching, like those with weak digestive heat who consume butter, quickly come to have views about the two extremes. Though existence is not established, also nonexistence is not established. 

For example, just as when the elements of pitta and so on become disturbed and have mutual conflicts, doctors pacify pitta for the illness of pitta, remove vata when vata predominates, eliminate kapha in those with kapha, and apply combination remedies for those with combination disorders. Without causing mutual conflicts also the happines [of the patient] improves. Like a doctor, infinite illnesses of afflictions are removed by extremes and perfect health is restored. 

So called "perfect health" is the tathāgatgarbha, i.e. the so called "buddhadhātu", but it is free from all [other] dhātus, being permanent, stable and persistent. Though the intelligent are not attached to existence, also so called "nonexistence" arises from telling lies. Silent about called "existence," they also do not make it into a premise. They also do not dispute it. These are to be understood as natural dharmatā. 

Fools who do not understand words, "While the seed of happiness exists in my body, this conflicts with permanence because suffering is shown." Grasping everything, these immature ones think "my body is not stable." If impermanence is explained, the immature think it is like a pot made by a potter. Since the intelligent on the other hand think "The seed of dharmakāya exists in my body," they do not grasp to everything. If selflessness is demonstrated, the immature grasp to the explanation thinking there is no self. The intelligent on the other hand think "The [self] exists conventionally, there is no doubt. If it is explained "tathagatagarbha is empty." The immature cultivate the dread of annihilation.The intelligent know that permanence, stability and immutability exists as a mere illusion. 158/a—159/a Lhasa edition

So here in the Nirvana Sutra we can clearly see that the Buddha refers to permanence, stability and immutability as being illusory. What does it mean to be illusory? Not real, but apparent. The Buddha continues:

When liberation is demonstrated, the immature grasp the thought, after the Buddhas are liberated, they become nonexistent. The intelligent know that the Buddha has come and the Buddha has gone, and say "The lion of humans arrived."  The immature grasp ignorance conditioning formation as a duality. The intelligent understand there is no difference between ignorance and knowledge, they are nondual. The immature grasp consciousness conditioned formation as a duality. The intelligent know that there is no difference between the formation and the absence of formations, they are nondual. Likewise, the immature grasp all virtue and nonvirtue as two different things. The intelligent understand them as nondual...the immature cultivate the idea that in the tathāgatagarbha, everything conditioned is impermanent. The intelligent understand this as nondual. That is the nature of the intelligent. The immature grasp all phenomena as nonself in Buddha's explanation of nonself. The intelligent understand that "self exists" and "there is no་self are nondual, that is the nature of the intelligent. The tathāgatagarbha praised by buddhas beyond measure was explained by me in the Sarvapuṇya-samuccaya sūtra, in which it is held that the "self exists" and "the self does not exist" are nondual. 

Son of a good family, in the appearance of entering into the nonduality in the Sarvapuṇya-samuccaya sūtra and the great Prajñāpāramita sūtra, I have explained the "self exists" and "the self does not exist" as nondual, remember this!" 159/a —160/a

So, here the main point is not to get hung up on the words, permanent, stable, immutable, which are just illusions, nor should one get hung up on self and nonself, knowing that self is just a convention. All in all, pretty standard Buddhist fare.

Empowerments are related to practices. And there are all kinds of rig pa'i tshal dbangs, from ones that just hold up one to two items to those that give full fledged explanations of various aspects of the path [the kind you are talking about]. So it is really not enough to say "Oh, the rig pa'i tshal dbang is the best thing since sliced bread." You have to be very specific. There are lots of rig pa'i tshal dbang that are no different than the fourth in brevity.

Of course the GZT goes all out, is like a kitchen sink of dbangs, elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate, extremely unelaborate, and it does not stop there, I know since I was at the one in Virginia, but...dbangs are one thing, practice is another. 

(And, while I am getting every closer to putting out the Vimalamitra book, there are reams of stuff yet to edit and publish from the GZT.)

Frankly, in my opinion, claiming that this thing and that thing is more profound than this and that is a bit of an error. For example, where you aware that in Kālacakra there is an outer four empowerments, an inner four empowerments and so on? Or that in Lamdre there are many empowerments, not just a few, so in reality, when you make the claims that you do, you cheapen Nyingma by falsely elevating it. 

Nyingmapas like to claim their teachings as the highest thing on Buddha's green earth, but when you get right down to it, it is all just a complicated mess of ever conflicting systems, with each "higher" level saying the last one is shit. It is really a lot of proliferation and I have studied it and practiced it in detail for 20 years now.

The Uttaratantra states:

Unconditioned, effortless, 
not realized through other conditions,
endowed with wisdom, compassion and power, 
buddhahood is endowed with two benefits.

But what does this really all mean? 

When we examine Asanga's comments on this, he states:

When these are summarized, buddhahood is described with eight qualties. If it is asked what those eight qualities are, they are unconditioned, effortless, not realized through other conditions, wisdom, compassion, power, the abundance of one's own benefit and the abundance of others' benefit. [Buddhahood] is unconditioned because it is the nature of lacking a beginning, middle and end. It is called "effortless" because peace is endowed with the dharmakāya. It is not realized through other conditions because each person must realize it for themselves. It is wisdom because those three things are realized. [Buddhahood] is compassionate because [the Buddha] shows the path. It is powerful because it is free from suffering and affliction. The former three [unconditioned, effortless and not realized through other conditions] are for one's own benefit; the latter three [wisdom, compassion and power] are for others' benefit. 

In that regard, the conditioned is fully understood as arising somewhere, and also understood as abiding and perishing. Because those do not exist [arising, abiding and perishing], buddhahood itself is unconditioned without a beginning, middle and an end. This is seen as a differentiation made through the dharmakāya. Because all proliferation and concepts are pacified, [buddhahood] is effortless [lhun gyis grub].  Buddhahood is not realized through other conditions because it is realized through wisdom oneself produced. Here, udayo [to produce] is not the arising of a desire for realization. As such, the tathāgata is unconditioned due to the truth, out of the characteristics of non-engagement, all the activities of the buddha effortlessly engaged in without impediment and without interruption for as long as samsara exists

So let us parse this out a little bit.

Asanga states in his commentary on the Uttaratantra:

...the conditioned is understood as arising somewhere, and also understood as abiding and perishing. Because those do not exist [arising, abiding and perishing], buddhahood itself is unconditioned without a beginning, middle and an end.

Buddhahood is unconditioned because the trio of arising, abiding and perishing are false. Not because in contrast to things that arise, abide and perish, buddhahood does not arise, abide and perish. 

Buddhahood however has a cause, as he writes:

Buddhahood is not realized through other conditions because it is realized through wisdom oneself produced.

Buddhahood is also effortless, because, as he writes:

...all proliferation and concepts are pacified, [buddhahood] is effortless [lhun gyis grub]...As such, the tathāgata is unconditioned due to the truth; and from the characteristics of non-engagement, all the activities of the buddha are engaged in effortlessly [lhun grub], without impediment and without interruption for as long as samsara exists

As for tathāgatagarbha always existing in the continuums of sentient beings; if you think somehow tathāgatagarba is something other than or different than a sentient beings mind, there there is a fallacy of the tathāgatagarbha being something like an atman. But there is no atman in the tathāgatagarbha theory, not really. the supreme self, (paramātma) is explained very clearly in the Uttaratantra:

The supreme self is the pacification of the proliferations of self and and nonself.

But what does this mean? Asanga adds:

The perfection of self (ātmapāramitā) is known through two reasons: due to being free from proliferation of a self because of being free from the extreme of the non-buddhists and due to being free from the proliferation of nonself because of giving up the extreme of the śrāvakas.

He explains further:

From cultivating prajñāpāramita in order to turn away from seeing the five addictive aggregates as self, the non-existent self in which the others, the nonbuddhists, delight, one attains the result, the perfection of self. In this way all the others, the nonbuddhists, accept natureless things such as matter and so on as a self due to their being deceived by a characteristic of a self according to how those things are being apprehended, but that self never existed. 

The Tathāgata, on the other hand, has attained the supreme perfection of the selflessness of all phenomena through the wisdom that is in accord with just how things truly are, and though there is no self according to how he sees things, he asserts a self all the time because he is never deceived by the characteristic of a self that does not exist. Making the selfless into a self is like saying "abiding through the mode of nonabiding.

There are some people who, ignoring the Nirvana Sutra's admonition to rely on the meaning rather than on the words, fall headlong into eternalism, unable to parse the Buddha's profound meaning through addiction to naive literalism. 

Tathagatagarbha is just a potential to become a buddha. When we say it is has infinite qualities, this is nothing more nor less than when the Vajrapañjara praises the so called "jewel-like mind":

The jewel-like mind is tainted with
evil conceptual imputations;
but when the mind is purified it becomes pure. 
Just as space cannot be destroyed,
just as is space, so too is the mind. 
By activating the jewel-like mind
and meditating on the mind itself, there is the stage of buddhahood, 
and in this life there will be sublime buddhahood.
There is no buddha nor a person
outside of the jewel-like mind,
the abode of consciousness is ultimate, 
outside of which there isn't the slightest thing. 
All buddhahood is through the mind...
Matter, sensation, perception
formations and consciousness
these all arise from the mind,
these [five] munis are not anything else.
Like a great wishfulfilling gem, 
granting the results of desires and goals, 
the pure original nature of the true state of the mind
bestows the result, Buddha's awakening

There is no other basis apart from this natural purity of the mind that is inseparable clarity and emptiness. We can call it whatever we want, but still this fact remains. The Lankāvatara rightly observes that tathāgatagarbha is just a name for emptiness and the ālayavijñāna for those afraid of emptiness. Jayānanda writes that ālayavijñāna is the mind that comprehends the basis, i.e. emptiness. How else can the mind be purified of evil conceptual imputations other than by realizing emptiness? Emptiness free from all extremes is the pure original nature of the true state of the mind, so why bother confusing oneself with all kinds of rhetoric? The mind itself has two aspects, emptiness and clarity, ka dag and lhun grub, and these are inseparable. This inseparable clarity and emptiness is call the ālaya in gsar ma and the basis in Nyingma. This also known as tathagatagarbha when it encased in afflictions, the dharmadhātu from its ultimate side, the ālayavijñāna from its relative side and so on. It really is not that complicated.

As far as the other things goes, he is not saying that buddhanature is not a direct perception, he just thinks that it is a mistaken to say that only buddhas can have such a direct perception, he thinks (erroneously) that also tenth stage bodhisattvas can have such a direct perception (even though it is clearly stated that their perception of tathāgatagarbha is generic i.e. abstract, and not direct).

One can also explain the carya tantra, the Mañjuśrīnamasaṃgiti, according both Kālacakra and Dzogchen; but it does not make it a niruttarayoga tantra or an atiyoga tantra. See my point? Everyone classfies Guhyagarba as a Mahāyoga tantra. Some people sub-classify it ati of mahā.

To say that something is unborn is to say either a) it always existed from time immemorial b) it never arose and is not something one would consider real. If it is former, then one's view is no different than nonbuddhists. If it is the latter, than wisdom is just as empty as everything else (buddhist view).

One cannot find the nature of water apart from water. It does not precede or succeed it. Now then, if you are an essentialist [Hindu, etc.], you will argue that all water derives its nature from some hypothetical essence of water. If you are a nominalist [Buddhist], you will argue our notion of a characteristic of water is an abstraction derived from our experiences of water. So, the answer is that your nature of water is merely an abstraction, and does not really exist. See MMK chapter 5:7:

Therefor space is not existent, it is not non-existent, is not the characterized, 
is not the characteristic; also any other of the five elements are the same as space. 


And 5:8:

Some of small intelligence, see existents in terms of ‘is’ or ‘is not’;
they do not perceive the pacification of views, or peace.

Right, this actually only happens from the side of sentient being. In reality, the dharmakāya does not produce anything. The Mahāyāna Uttaratantra states:

Just as the reflection of Indra appears
in a pure ground of sapphire, [435/a]
likewise, the reflection of the body of the Munindra
arises in the pure ground of the mind of migrating beings. 
The reflection that arises or subsides for migrating beings is engaged
through the power of whether their minds are permeated or not with taints,
just like the appearance of the reflection [of Indra] in the worlds
is in the same way not seen as existing or not existing. 

The Vajracchedikā Sūtra states:

Whoever sees me as form, 
whoever knows me as sound,
those people who apprehend me
incorrectly do not see me, [411/b]
and so do not see the dharmakāya.
The buddhas are dharmatā.
The guides are the dharmakāya.
Since dharmatā is unknowable,
it cannot be known.

So you have to ask yourself what dharmatā is. The Saptaśatikā-prajñāpāramitā Sūtra states:

Inconceivable wisdom is the wisdom of the buddhas. The absence of perception of any phenomenon is the wisdom of the buddhas…If it is asked why, the omniscience with the mode of the nonexistence of wisdom in the ultimate is the wisdom of the buddha.

The Mahāyāna Uttaratantra states:

Just as space is nothing at all, invisible,
imperceptible, unsupported, 
totally beyond sight, 
formless, indemonstrable
and cannot be seen
even though one looks high and low,
likewise, even though one looks for buddha 
everywhere, he isn’t there.

The Guhyagarbha is a mahāyoga tantra, which mentions Dzogchen exactly twice and most importantly in chapter thirteen. You are not the only person who can read, or who has taken teachings on these things.

Your position above is not more profound than the Uttaratantra, which of course makes a distinction between impure, pure/impure and pure, from the perspective of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. No one ever said the path was additive, it is only subtractive, gathering the two accumulations for example, means just that one is removing the two obscurations. When one is obscured, one is impure; when on the path, especially the aryan path, pure/impure; and when one attains buddhahood, pure. It does not mean that one has in fact actually removed or added anything. Nevertheless, these so called buddha qualities both can be considered naturally perfected, and they also are produced by a process of transformation and there is no contradiction between these two things. If someone thinks there is a contradiction, they have to explain why they are not at present omniscient.

[the basis] too is not naturally perfect (lhun grub).

And thus gzhan stong slips off the other side of the horse while trying avoid the extreme of annihilation. Such an assertion of existence in the ultimate cannot be considered free from extremes, because it is an extreme. This is why the Buddha states in the Ārya-saṃvṛitiparamārthasatyanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Devaputra: ultimate truth is beyond the range of the omniscient wisdom endowed with the supreme of all aspects. However one describes ultimate truth, it is not like that.

And as Gorampa states:

Other than the need for the existence of a middle path which avoids two extremes in all three vehicles, as explained in the Ratnavali, the system of Mādhyamikas must be free from the extreme of permanence because the ultimate asserted in the lower vehicles is not established, and free from the extreme of annihilation since the causes and results of action are not denied in the relative. 

Also based upon this Mahāyāna, since one meditates having brought together the trio of the special view that reality’s own nature is free from the extremes of the dualistic grasping of existence and nonexistence and so on, compassion in relation to sentient beings, and the development of Mahāyāna bodhicitta, at the time of the final result while never moving from the state of the dharmadhātu free from all proliferation one will effortlessly produce the benefit of sentient beings throughout all of space. 


There cannot be a Madhyamaka better than this, nor a result better than this.

Title: Re: Mipham was not gzhan stong

Right, so you did not even answer the question. 

As a basic definition, nirvana, space and so on are included in "all phenomena." In fact, the Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā, etc., state:

All phenomena are included with the category of suchness, those cannot go beyond that category. If it asked why, Subhuti no coming or coming can be perceived in suchness. Subhuti, all phenomena are within these categories: the dharmadhātu, are the limit of reality, uniformity and inconceivability.


And:

Subhuti, when categorized, all phenomena are the nature of being unreal. Subhuti, in the same way, also all phenomena are nature of emptiness, all phenomena are the nature of signlessness, all phenomena are the nature of aspirationalessness. Subhuti, in the same way also, all phenomena are the nature of suchness, all phenomena are the nature of the limit of reality, all phenomena are the nature of dharmadhātu. 

This being so, it is ludicrous to assert that the ultimate is empty of all relative phenomena. Such an assertion directly contradicts the words of the Buddha. It is one thing to claim "tathāgatagarbha is empty of adventitious afflictions." It is quite another to claim that the ultimate is empty of all relative phenomena. The ultimate is merely the emptiness of all phenomena, there is no other ultimate that can be found.

What you do not seem to understand is while the sūtra passages you are citing are noncontroversial, the gzhan stong interpretation Dolbupa applied to them in general is controversial for many reasons, but mostly having to do with his novel (and largely unprecedented) interpretation of the three own natures, his idea that the perfected nature (parinispanna) was empty of both the dependent (paratantra) and imputed (parikalpita) natures. In fact Maitreyanath, Asanga and Vasubandhu uniformly consider that the absence of the imputed in the dependent is the perfected. The second place where the gzhan stong view is found contradictory to Nāgārjuna is that if one follows the gzhan stong view, samsara and nirvana cannot be inseparable. Therefore, the statement by the Buddha in the Hevajra Tantra must be false:

This so-called "samsara," 
just this is nirvana.


 Many other clear and unambiguous statements by the Buddha on the identity of samsara and nirvana must also be considered false. Not to mention Nāgārjuna's famed dictum:

Samsara is not the slightest bit different from nirvana, 
nirvana is not the slightest bit different from samsara;
whatever is the limit of nirvana, that is the limit of samsara, 
a difference between those two does not exist even slightly. 

We can see that Vasubandhu agrees with this meaning in the Sūtrālaṃkārabhāṣya:

The meaning of nirvana being all-pervasive is that because samsara and peace (nirvana) have one taste due to one not having concepts about their faults and qualities, in the respect there is no difference between samsara and nirvana.

That is the true unperverted emptiness, ultimate truth, dharmakāya, [3/b] the limit of the real, suchness, and emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects. The powers, major and minor marks and so on are the unconditioned qualities that abide in that from the beginning.

What characterizes a gzhan stong pa is the use of three own-natures to explain the two truths of Madhyamaka. This trend begins with the 10th century Indian polymath, Ratnakaraśanti, in his Madhyamakālaṃkara. 

However, Longchenpa never does this, relegating the three own natures to the cittamantra system. He never conflates it with Madhyamaka.

There most certainly two ways the concept is used, one in Vajrayāna, where it is taken to be the so called indestructible bindu which is composed of the elemental winds as well as the material from one's father and mind, along with one's mind; and the sugatagarbha strictly as dharmakāya, which is said in Nirvana sūtra to exist in the body solely for the reason that the mind inhabits the body. It is the mind that is encased by affliction, nothing else. Of course, we can also understand the many statements in sūtra and tantra that the mind itself is buddhahood, and there is no buddhahood to seek out apart from the mind. The mind when purified, becomes the dharmakāya, but it is not dharmakāya from the very beginning, even though its nature is intrinsically pure. You have mistaken the cause (intrinsically pure mind) for the result (dharmakāya, when that intrinsically pure mind is stripped of all adventitious obscurations). For example, The Dharmarāja Sūtra states:

The Bhagavan said to the bodhisattva Many Desires, “Many Desires, before, that was was tainted. Now it is clean, pure, very pure. The mind is one thing, nondual, without any other properties. Since that mind is pure, all phenomena become pure. 

Son of a good family, for example, a tree is cut down at the root, not at the branches and leaves. Likewise, if the mind is realized, it is equivalent with cutting all phenomena at the root. Since the mind is pure, all phenomena will be pure.”

As for Buddhahood itself, the Pitāputrasamāgamana Sūtra states:

Great king, “buddhahood” is a term for seeing reality. “Seeing reality” is a term for the limit of reality. “Limit of reality” is a term for the dharmadhātu. 
Great king, the dharmadhātu cannot be explained apart from being just a name, just a symbol, just a convention, [just relative], just an expression and just a designation.

The sugatagarbha exists intrinsically in all sentient beings. That exists just as sesame seeds are permeated with oil. Its basis — it is based on the material aggregate. It’s location —&nbsp;it is located in the center of the heart. Also that is called “the transcendent state of Samantabhadra’s sealed locket”. For example, like a sealed locket of leather, inside its location, from the center of a five colored light there exist peaceful kāyas the size of mustard grains in halos of light. That is the location of vidyā. For example, it is like form of a vase.

Here, it is said that sugatagarbha has a physical location in the body. So really, there is a difference in how this concept is used in sutra and in tantra. 

There are other Dzogchen texts which indicate that sugatagarbha can be visibly seen with the eyes through various yogic techniques. This is really quite different than the way it is presented in sutra, won't you agree?

It is questionable whether there actually is a chapter 8 in the original Mahāyāna Parinirvana sūtra. The direct Tibetan translation from Sanskrit by Jinamitra, Jñānagarbha and Devacandra has only five chapters, in three thousand and nine hundred ślokas. 

The version from Chinese is considerably longer, by an entire volume. I personally do not trust the long Chinese recension at all.

This is the question you asked:

Yes, so how does that citation support the statement "Buddhist tathata is freedom from extremes."?

I already told you that the Nikayas do not discuss the issue, so why would I bother trying to cite something it does not exist? Suchness is principally a Mahāyāna tenet.

However, the Advice to Katyāyana is an Agamic sūtra, and it one used frequently to demonstrate that Buddha taught freedom extremes in a limited way to the śrāvakas.

Sthiramati clarifies the above:

"The term "self" in this context means "svabhava", i.e., it means "since the Buddhas become the nature of selflessness, they obtain the supreme self."

But this is not a self that is separate from the aggregates, nor is it a self apart from what is wrongly identified as a self. This is no more controversial than when Candrakirtī states that absence of nature is the nature of all things.

In order to understand that Vasubandhu is trying to at here, however, one needs to consult Vinitadeva's subcommentary, the Prakaraṇa viṃśatikāṭīkā:

...བརྗོད་དུ་མེད་པའི་བདག་ཉིད་ཀྱིས་ཞེས་བྱ་བ་ནི་བརྗོད་པར་མི་ནུས་པར་རང་གི་ངོ་བོས་ཞེས་བྱ་བའི་ཐ་ཚིག་གོ

Thus "the inexpressible atman" turns out to mean "...a term for an intrinsic nature [རང་གི་ངོ་བོ, svarūpa] that cannot be expressed."

Having clarified this, we can then see how best to understand the following statement:

རྣལ་འབྱོར་པས་རང་གི་སེམས་དང་གཞན་གྱི་སེམས་བརྗོད་དུ་མེད་པའི་བདག་ཉིད་དུ་མ་རིག་སྟེ། དེ་དག་རང་གི་གཟུང་བའི་ཆ་གཉིས་རང་དང་གཞན་གྱི་སེམས་ལྟ་བུར་རིག་པ་ན་རང་དང་གཞན་གྱི་སེམས་རིག་གོ་ཞེས་རྟོག་པར་བྱེད་ཀྱི།
ཡང་དག་པའི་དོན་དུ་ན་རང་དང་གཞན་གྱི་སེམས་ཀྱི་རང་གི་ངོ་བོ་ལ་ནི་མ་རིག་གོ།

Yogins do not know the inexpressible nature [atman] of their own or others' minds; when they know the dualistic part of their own apprehensions, seeming like their own minds and others' minds, they generate the concept, "My mind and the minds of others are known". However, in reality, they have not known the intrinsic nature [svarūpa] of their own and other's minds.

Thus, I think it is very hasty to presume that Vasubandhu's Viṃśatikāvṛtti can be used to justify an upanishadic-like self in Buddhadharma. This text in turn needs to be read in light of Vinitadeva's subcommentary, which clarifies what Vasubandhu is saying very clearly.

Without consulting Indian commentaries that may only exist in Tibetan, it is very hard to get a handle on Indian Buddhist texts when read through the eyes people who are expert mainly in Upanishadic, Vedic, and other non-Buddhist literature in Sanskrit. 

Also, one needs to look and see what Xuan Tshang says about this passage and so on.

No, and this is of course is the reason most Lamas think the idea of giving deity transmissions via webcast is controversial. For example, ChNN gives what he calls "don dbang" i.e. meaning empowerments, which involve no ritual objects via webcast, but he will not give full fledged empowerments via webcasts. Garchen Rinpoche on the other hand frequently gives traditional empowerments via webcast. In my opinion, as long as one is participating in real time, then either way is not really an issue. That being said, attending in person is always better.

The difference between the former and the latter is that the former is a like a field that has been tilled, fertilized and planted; whereas the latter is like field that has not been tilled, has not been fertilized and not been planted. 

A person who has received an empowerment is termed "ripened", whereas those who have not received empowerments are termed "unripened." If one has not been ripened, one is not a candidate for the liberating instructions. 

And as I have written elsewhere, logic and inference are not authorities in Vajrayāna, scripture is. The Abhibodhikramopadeśa of Master Āryadeva states:

At the time of the ultimate view of secret mantra,
the direct perception by the mind and sense organs
as well as inferences are not authorities;
the profound scriptures and intimate instructions are authorities. 

This being the case, the Mahāmudratilaka Tantra states:

There is no siddhi for one who lacks empowerment,
just there is no butter from churning sand.
If one pridefully expounds the tantras and agamas
without empowerment,
immediately upon death master and disciple
go to hell even if siddhi has been attained.

So, you see, for Vajrayāna the issue of proper empowerments is not really something that depends on reason and inference. It depends on scripture and intimate instructions. And understanding that intellectuals might argue with such ideas, again Aryadeva writes in the Abhibodhikramopadeśa:

In evil future times,
without relying on profound scriptures and intimate instructions,
those who prioritize the twin reasonings of validation and proofs
will each grasp their own philosophy as sublime;
satisfied with a mere hidden meaning
and without any interest in the ultimate profound view, 
again they make refutations,
destroying themselves and others.

So when it comes to Secret Mantra, the tantras are the definitive authority. Also the rites must be properly performed, as the The Great Commentary Tantra of the Mayajala states:

Akaśagarbha, you should listen!
All of the tantras like mine
endowed with nondual wisdom,
like wishfulfilling gems, wish-granting trees 
and excellent vases
are proper places for devotion.
Even one [tantra] has inconceivable power
through different methods,
yielding accomplishment in the same way.
However, there is no accomplishment with defective rituals.

This is why it is very important to understand and follow the proper ritual procedures if one is both a master of Vajrayāna as well as a student of Vajrayāna. One's very realization is at stake.

Title: Re: More on recorded empowerments, etc.

At the most basic level, it is simply a question of procedure: in order for a master to confer an empowerment, he must first create himself in the form of that mandala or deity, as well as create a front-created mandala or deity (from which one actually receives the empowerment) before he can introduce students to that mandala in the form of a series of guided visualizations, which he does through a series of verbal instructions and visual cues, which include mantras and mudras. 

If the steps  above are not taken, no empowerment will be have been conferred. That is just how it is. For example, if on an assembly line you do not assemble the parts in the proper way, your product will not work. So it is with an empowerment: if the procedures of the ritual are not carried out properly and in their correct order, the empowerment will not be valid. 

If the master conferring the empowerment has not himself received the empowerment, the empowerment will not be valid. If he has not done the basic retreats, or at least received permission from his own guru to give the empowerments, the empowerment will not be valid, and the master will himself have broken his own samaya regarding revealing secrets to those who have not been ripened by empowerment (you may ask whether I am breaking samaya by discussing this —&nbsp;the answer is no, because I am not discussing specific details of Vajrayāna practice). If he omits parts of the ritual of the empowerment, the empowerment will not only not be valid, it will not have taken place at all. 

Empowerments are very precise formula of ritual procedures which are designed to give transmissions into very specific practices in a structured way. Thus if the structure of the empowerment is violated, the transmission does not happen. Therefore, the idea that a recording of a mere part of an empowerment (the activities for disciples) can serve as an empowerment is a deeply mistaken idea on the part of anyone who holds it. Not only will there be no master conferring the empowerment; since there is no master, the conditions for the creation of the mandala/deity are absent, thus there is no mandala/deity. If there is no mandala/deity, there is nothing into which the student may be initiated. Therefore, the empowerment depends on the creation of the mandala/deity, the mandala/deity depends on the samadhi of the master, and the master's ability to confer the empowerment itself depends two things: a) he himself has received the transmission and b) he has either done the retreats for that practice or been commanded by his own guru to confer the transmission. 

In addition there are ten things a master must know to be qualified to give empowerments. This can be looked up elsewhere.

No, not if you are an ordinary person. If you are an ordinary person, you must go through step by step and analyze all four extremes. Having ascertained through analysis that a phenomena existing through the four extremes does exist in the relative, one then applies that analysis to the ultimate, finding that also that there is nothing which can be found in the ultimate existing by way of the four extremes. Then, as Khenpo Ngalo states:

Likewise, the mind free from the trio of arising, ceasing and abiding, existence and nonexistence, and being and nonbeing, is naked in the emptiness free from proliferation. In one’s experience, the unceasing stream of mere clarity and mere awareness is empty at the time of being clear and clear at the time being empty — do not grasp clarity or emptiness. Rest wholly, nakedly and freely in the state that is free from extremes, without divisions, inexpressible and beyond thought. 
Finally, rest free of concepts [had de chad de] without grasping in mere inexpressibility.

In reality, the passage you citing is referring to reliance on the Dharma (among the four reliances). It says in full in the Sanskrit -- &gt; Chinese -- &gt; Tibetan translation: 

"Relying on the Dharma" is the parinirvana of the Tathāgata. The Dharma of the Buddha is the dharmatā of Dharmas. So-called "dharmatā" is the Tathagāta. That being so, the Tathāgata is permanent and unchanging. Any person who says the Tathāgata is impermanent, that person has not seen nor known dharmatā 

The Tibetan translation direct from Sanskrit however however reads a little more clearly:

Dharmatā is the parinirvana of the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is permanent, stable, and eternal. This is the dharmatā of all the Buddhas. Whoever sees the Tathāgata as impermanent, they do not know dharmatā."

So it is not really clear that the Nirvana Sūtra makes the bold declaration that dharmatā = tathāgata. It seems that the sutra is actually saying that the permanence, stability and eternity is the dharmatā, or real nature, of all buddhas. That is a much different message than the one you want to present. In fact, I would just say that the Chinese translation upon which you are relying is embellished and somewhat inaccurate and whenever someone reads something in it, they need to check it against the Tibetan translation direct from Sanskrit.

No, actually, not even bodhisattvas on the stages can see buddhanature/tathāgatagarba. This is why this sūtra refers to buddhanature as the tathāgataguhyagarbha.

You are not understanding the point —&nbsp;an inference cannot turn into a direct perception. All an inference will allow you to do is recognize something you have not seen before. 

But even here, since the realization of emptiness at the first bhumi is nonconceptual, when you are realizing it, are you aware of it during the path of seeing? Or is it something you post-facto conceptually recognize that you have experienced? If it is as in the first case, then how is the first bhumi nonconceptual? And if it is the second case, then there is a missing link in your account, because we all clearly agree as long as one has not attained the Mahāyāna path of seeing, our notion of emptiness is strictly a conceptual inference. 

It is for this reason there is a big debate which approach to emptiness one takes: the generic approach to emptiness of all three vehicles, the emptiness of inherent existence, or the special emptiness of Mahāyāna, the freedom from all four extremes (which alone can produce the Mahāyāna path of seeing). Apart from the Gelugpas, all Madhyamaka approaches, including Nāgārjuna's clearly underline the need to negate all four extremes in the ultimate, not merely one. 

This has direct bearing on the mind of a Buddha. The mind of a Buddha cannot have concepts because the mind of a Buddha is never separate from state of equipoise on reality —&nbsp;a Buddha is in equipoise 24/7/365. The mind of a buddha is a nonconceptual stream of clarity and emptiness that is unsullied by any remaining obscurations. A Buddha response to the wishes of sentient beings spontaneously, like a wishfulfilling gem, without any intention or thought at all.

Stage skippers are people who jump from say the fourth bhumi to the seventh, or the seventh to the ninth, not the first to the tenth. 

The realization of Buddhahood depends on the two accumulations —&nbsp;people who think otherwise are merely fantasizing. 

Nyangral basically supports Ba Salnang's account of the Samye Debate, FYI.

I think we need to be careful about claims that Nub was a Chan practitioner —&nbsp;I think it is very doubtful, he is too late.

Yes, that is what we practice, but we study sūtra to understand what it is that tantra is seeking to accomplish so rapidly, and also so that we maintain a correct Madhyamaka view. To some extent the latter is not strictly necessary, because even Yogacarins attain full awakening through the sadhana method even though in post-equipoise their view is a little extreme. This being so, there is much hope for both gzhan stong pas and their mirror image, the Gelugpas.

Title: Re: More on recorded empowerments, etc.
Content:
For the purposes of an empowerment there are three kinds: a drawn mandala, a powder mandala and a body mandala. 

With respect to the first two, there is a procedure of setting out the mandala, i.e. preparing the site, laying it out, coloring it and so on. With respect to the last it is based completely on the samadhi of the master conferring the empowerment, whereas the other two are supports for the samadhi of the master, but primarily as a aid to students of lesser capacity. Whichever the case may be, the mandala is in any case created and then dissolved at the end of the rite. After that it is up to the students to do the daily practice themselves. 

So for example, the Vajrakilaya empowerment you attended with HHST has been dissolved —&nbsp;it no longer exists in that space, in that place. The minute HHST was done with the rites of conferring the empowerments, he began to finish the Ganapuja (empowerments are actually a branch of ganapuja activities), offer tormas and in the end he dismissed the wisdom beings in the front created mandala and the vase mandala and dissolved his self-creation thus ending the rite completely apart from the dedication of merits, aspirations and benedictory prayers. 

The only sense in which we can say that mandala continues is in the mandala of students who attended the empowerment. But until you yourself do the retreats, and so on, you cannot give that empowerment to someone else. That mandala does not exist on the video as a living entity. It cannot practice the sadhana, it also cannot grant empowerment, etc. 

The misconception which Astus has is the notion that an empowerment is merely communicating information received through the five senses, thus for him there is no difference between an empowerment and a recording of an empowerment, it is merely information. While it is true that information is being communicated through the five sense, that is not all that is happening, there are samadhis involved on the part of both the master and the students at the same time, there is the dependent origination which needs to be actively created between the master and the student at the same time, particularly in the lower empowerments; there are the samaya vows conferred and received and the agreement to follow them (Whatever you say boss, all that I will do....), and so on — all of the things which I have now explained exhaustively.

Frankly — and no disrespect intended towards Garchen Rinpoche — it does not really matter what his answer is. 

For example, let us say some one claims "Oh, there is God in Buddhadharma, I heard my guru say so" and even goes so far as to find a quote where this or that  guru says there is God in Buddhism. This does not mean that this is correct, or that there is fact the doctrine of God in Buddhadharma, or that we need to take that statement literally. 

Let us say for example, that someone claims "My guru says that there is no rebirth and no karma in Buddhism" and even goes so far as to find a quote where this or that guru says there is there is no rebirth and no karma in Buddhadharma. This does not mean that this is correct, or that there is fact no doctrine of rebirth and karma in Buddhadharma.

This is why, in the end, even what one's guru says must be subjected to scrutiny, it must be measured against what is taught in the tantra and the authoritative opinions of masters of the past. If someone who one regards as a guru teaches something that does not correspond with Buddhadharma, one must ignore those statements.  Since we subject all the Buddha's words to scrutiny, why should we not do the same with respect to what our gurus say? Why should we abandon our critical thinking merely because we think our guru is a Buddha? We should not. 

In particular, when confronted with novelties such as the assertion that people can receive empowerments from recordings of past empowerments, people must use common sense in addition to reason. Who is making this claim? Why is this claim being made?, and so on.

That is not the point. The point is whether the rite is complete or not with all its parts. 

A master does a sadhana, creates a mandala, invites the students into that mandala and closes the mandala. 

If the master does not do the sadhana before hand, creating the mandala, even if he reads the portion of the initiation text meant create the students as the mandala, it won't happen. The master must be visualizing himself as that specific deity for which he is giving the empowerment having already properly performed the sadhana himself, before he can give the empowerment. Likewise, during the empowerment, the master must visualize all the students in the form the deity, he must summon the wisdom continuum of that deity to merge with the visualized form of the students he has visualized as the deity, make it firm, and then bestow the various blessings of body speech and mind will maintaining all of this visualization continuously. Also the student from their side must try their best to follow and do the described visualizations at the same time the master is doing them. 

Finally, and importantly, at the end of the ritual the master dissolves the mandala completely. Once he finishes his sadhana, the mandala has been dissolved. One cannot receive empowerment into a mandala that has been dissolved, just as one cannot enter a house that has been constructed and then dismantled. 

For example, while one can watch a video of a house being constructed and dismantled, one will never be able to enter that house at any time while one is watching the recording. If one the other hand you are there for the raising of the structure, you can enter the structure until it has been dismantled. Likewise, in terms of receiving an initiations, if you are present for the master's creation of the students as the mandala, then you can enter that mandala, but if you are not present in real time, then it does not work. Why? Because the master and the student have to be engaged at the same time in the process of the giving and receiving the empowerment, they have to be in the mandala together. This is impossible with a recording.

Yes, there is a difference, as I told you. 

For example, a master has to create the mandala: there is the master's creation of himself as the mandala, the front created mandala, the mandala in the vase and so on and so forth. 

Once the ritual has finished, all these mandalas and so on are dissolved so they do not exist anymore since they are not being maintained by the master's visualization, having been dissolved. I explained all of this already in the other thread on this point.  

Not only that, but the recording generally only covers the activities for the disciple. All the activities that the master has to do before conferring the empowerment are not recorded. 

Thus the recording is incapable of doing recreating these things since a recording has no mind, no volition and so on.

Really, there is no chance a recorded empowerment can actually confer empowerment, it is just not possible.

You see, this is why when people like yourself, who really have zero understanding of Varjayāna weigh in in such topics, your words are a best ignorant and at worst misleading.

There is a Mahāyāna system for going for refuge and generating bodhicitta on one's own if one cannot find a master. It is also not at all clear that when one goes for Mahāyāna refuge in this way, one is adopting the five vows of a lay person as well as the bodhisattva vows. 

But, one cannot self-ordain as a novice, or a monk, nor can one confer upon oneself any empowerment. 

In general one should receive the three vows from a master and then enhance them by renewing them daily. Unless of course you are a very high Dzogchen practitioner like so many people we see on Buddhist internet boards who have transcended the need for mundane things such as paying attention to the state of their vows.

Of course you can give your citations. But I meant from Sutra. 

When one says that a Buddha has jñan̄a, but not vijñāna, this does not mean a Buddha is inert, it means the opposite. 

Cognition for an ordinary sentient being requires mental factors, but a Buddha's jñāna does not require mental factors. 

For example there is a sutra passage cited in the Yogācārabhūmi viniścayasaṃgrahanī that states:

"Bhagavān, how should the mental factors of the tathāgatas be known?"

"Mañjuśrī, the mind (citta, sems), intellect (yid, manas) or consciousness (vijñāna, rnam shes) of tathāgatas are indeed not differentiated in discerning wisdom, but the mind of a tathāgata arises without formations, and should known to be like an emanation."

"Bhagavān, it being the case the dharmakāya of the tathāgatas is free from all action of formations, on the other hand, do mental factors arise without the action of formations?"

"Mañjuśrī, it is due to past cultivation of method and wisdom.

Mañjuśrī, one awakens [from sleep] because of the power of past formations, but though there are no formations for arising in the concentration on cessation, one arises [from concentration] only through the power of past formations. Just as like the mental factors of sleep and the concentration on cessation, the mental factors of the tathāgatas should be known to be formations of past cultivation of method and wisdom."

"Bhagavān, do the emanations of the tathāgatas have minds or not?"

"Mañjuśrī, Though they do not have minds, they are also not mindless, because minds are neither independent nor dependent."

In other words, the mind of a tathāgata is like an emanation, it appears to function in all the ways that a mind functions, but in reality, there are no present active formations happening. Everything that seems to happen in the mind of a Buddha is based on some past cultivation of method and wisdom on the path. 

So Buddhas seem to have minds, but in reality, all they have is wisdom.

Anyway, this is a stupid conversation —&nbsp;you cannot receive empowerments from a recording of an empowerment, period. End of story. Just like you cannot receive monks vows from a recording, and so on. People who think they have received an empowerment from a recording are just deluding themselves and received nothing whatsoever. Even if they recite mantras and practices they think they have received from a recording there will be no benefit whatsoever, in fact the opposite will be the case. 

If you want to receive a vow, any vow, you have to do it in the proper way, and receiving them from a recording cannot be construed as proper at all.

There are two places where the term mahāmudra is used; the first is in Yoga tantra, where it refers primarily to the form of the deity. The second is in anuttarayoga tantra where it is described as the siddhi of mahāmudra, an accomplishment, the attainment of Buddhahood. 

In other words, the term arises solely in connection with Vajrayāna practice.

How so? Mahāmudra (as in four yogas of mahāmudra) as practiced in the Kagyu tradition is a gradual approach based as much on the Bhavanakrama as it is the dohas; Chan/Zen is always a sudden approach. 

In other words, in Kagyu mahāmudra practice, you have to develop one-pointedness first, then non-proliferation, then one taste, etc. Whereas in Soto Zen, for example, "Just sitting" is considered Buddhahood itself. 

DG, have you ever received teachings on any of this? It just seems to me that you are engaging in a lot of proliferation around these issues.

In Vajrayāna there is no such thing as modernism. There is the lineage, and how the lineage presents the teachings. The lineage is unalterable and without a lineage there is no Vajrayāna to speak of. 

Zen, for example, is a sūtrayāna teaching, and this while there is rhetoric about the lineage of patriarchs, ancient buddhas and so on, there is not a universally held idea that the lineage is something inviolable or absolutely necessary. Plenty of people practice Zen without the kind of guru devotion that characterizes Vajrayāna. Also these days many people practice Zen who really do not believe that Zen was actually passed down in a lineage from the time of the Buddha. There is more room for so-called "modernism" in Zen. 

But in Vajrayāna, the Vajrayāna teachings are held to come directly from Buddha Vajradhara to our gurus. There is truly little point in trying to practice Vajrayāna if you don't believe this. The second thing is that one should have faith that one's root guru is actually a Buddha, or at least one should try to develop that sincere conviction over time. If one does not have this conviction, it is very difficult to make progress in Vajrayāna practice; but if one has this conviction, it becomes very easy. 

Since there is no way to modernize this essential feature of Vajrayāna, Vajrayāna will always resist modernization. 

For example, there is a well known story about how Naropa displayed a mandala in the sky to Marpa, and asked Marpa to whom he would prostrate, the guru or the mandala, Marpa, thinking that he saw his guru everyday, but never saw such miraculously manifested mandalas, chose to prostrate to the mandala...big mistake that cost Marpa his family lineage...

So, Mahamudra in the modern world is an impossibility, if by that one means, how can Mahamudra be adapted to fit modern society —&nbsp;it can't, we can only adapt ourselves to Mahāmudra, mahāmudra cannot be adapted to suit us.

The text is the pointing out instruction. It is not a direct introduction like what you receive in Dzogchen. Nor is it an introduction such as you receive in the four empowerments. Of course the fact that the text says:

 Meditate next on a profound path of guru-yoga and, after making hundreds of very strong, fervent requests, dissolve your visualized guru into yourself.

This automatically means you must be someone who has received niruttarayoga tantra empowerment. There is no guru without a such an empowerment, so how can one speak of guru yoga? Guru Yoga is a method exclusive to higher tantra, the name of which is not encountered in lower tantra much less sūtra.

Guru Yoga can produce a wisdom that resembles the wisdom produced by the two stages, indeed, but really, this is only for the people of highest capacity or who have developed their capacity through much practice. And of course, to be qualified to practice guru yoga, one should have received all four empowerments in a proper way. 

Sadhana practice is indeed for those who do not manage to attain buddhahood during the empowerment. People misunderstand empowerments, thinking they are merely a method of introducing this or that practice. Actually, empowerments are meant to cause people to attain buddhahood; failing that, they practice sadhanas with the two stages and guru yoga. 

The reality of it is however that very few people in history have attained buddhahood during an empowerment, or even the bhumis.

Lamdre speaks about a basis, a path and a result. 

The basis is the ālaya cause continuum —&nbsp;this is exactly the same thing Kagyus call "ground mahāmudra." It is nothing more nor less than the nature of the mind. 

In Lamdre, when ālaya, aka the inseparability of clarity and emptiness, is approached via sūtra methods in the Triple Vision teachings, one meditates upon it via śamatha and vipaśyāna.  In the beginning, in terms of śamatha, one uses an external object, a blue flower, then a blue cloth or the sky and finally, one focuses inwardly on the naked clarity of the mind itself. In terms of the vipaśyāna, one establishes that the appearances are mind, the mind is illusory and dependently arisen, and finally that dependent arising is natureless and free from all extremes. When one is capable of resting in the naked clarity of the mind in conjunction with the insight that this clarity is empty and free from extremes, this is called the union of śamatha and vipaśyāna. However, this is merely a sutrayāna meditation and will not lead to Buddhahood in a single lifetime no matter how good a meditation it may be. As the Nalendra Khenpo, Ngawang Lodo states in his Lamp of the Path of Freedom and Omniscience:

In one’s experience, the unceasing stream of mere clarity and mere awareness is empty at the time of being clear and clear at the time being empty — do not grasp clarity or emptiness. Rest wholly, nakedly and freely in the state that is free from extremes, without divisions, inexpressible and beyond thought. 

But this is not the state of mahāmudra nor is it the realization of mahāmudra. 

The special view of Lamdre is called the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. This view can only be meditated upon after one has received the cause Hevajra empowerment. It is meditated upon prior to engaging in the meditations of the creation and completion stage. The way this is meditated is through thirty-two examples which establish phenomena as mind, mind as an illusion and illusion as natureless. Not only this but there is an inseparability of samsara and nirvana of the path and also an inseparability of samsara and nirvana of the result. 

Then there is the path method continuum, which is equivalent to so called "path mahāmudra" in the Kagyu system. This refers to the practice of the creation and completion stages. 

Finally, there is the result mahāmudra continuum. This refers to the buddhahood that is the result of the two stages. This is equivalent to the result mahāmudra in the Kagyu system. 

Now, it may be wondered, "Are these three continuums the same or are they different?" These three continuums are merely names for phases of a single continuum, much like the way Maitreyanath distinguishes between sentient beings, bodhisattvas and buddhas by labeling them respectively impure, pure/impure and pure. And as Jetsun Rinpoche points, the natural perfection of the qualities of buddhahood in the all-basis cause continuum or so called ground mahāmudra does not contradict transformation. 

So you see it is not simply enough to realize the nature of the mind and call that "mahāmudra." In order to achieve a result, a path is called for. The only way to extract the butter of mahāmudra is to take the milk of the nature of the mind and churn it with the two stages. Other than that, there is no way to realize mahāmudra.

It is not a direct introduction, it is a gradual introduction, that takes many sessions, like all sutra-based systems. You yourself admitted that Gampopa's "mahāmudra" was "sutra" mahāmudra. 

Now, when it comes to essence mahāmudra, there is an empowerment (the descent of the wisdom vajra empowerment) based in Indrabhuti's famous text, the Jñānasiddhi, and this is in fact a direct introduction, just like the fourth empowerment. 

All I can conclude from this discussion, Astus, is that you are not really very clear on the difference between "pointing out instructions", which is gradual,  and "direct introduction," which is immediate. 

Further, what you seem to fail to understand is that in actual practice, in general the Kagyus all practice creation and completion stage, combine the four yogas of mahāmudra with the completion stage, and practice the main practice of essence mahāmudra, Guru Yoga.

The intellectual view of sūtra and tantra (freedom from extremes) are identical, but their methods are different, their conduct is different and so on. 

Since there is no method of directly introducing this so called "natural state" that can be found in sūtra, one must depend on the methods taught by the Buddha in the tantras. And if one must depend on the methods taught by the Buddhas in the tantras, for what reason can one claim that is beyond or outside the Vajrayāna? 

There is only one ritual taught in common Mahāyāna that bears on our discussion in a real sense — that is the ritual of generating relative bodhicitta. Apart from that, the other rituals in Mahāyāna such as the recitations of dharanis and so in do not bear on our discussion. 

Secondly, since there is no method in common Mahāyāna for introducing or generating ultimate bodhicitta at all, how can one claim there is a method in sūtra for introducing mahāmudra? Even the word "mahāmudra" does not exist in any sūtra. If you claim there is such a method of introducing mahāmudra outside of a Vajrayāna context, in what sūtra is it taught, what Indian master composed the method? 

You might claim, suchness is the same whether we are discussing prajñāpāramitā or mahāmudra, and to that I will readily agree —&nbsp;but the issue is not about reality per se, it is about how that reality is realized, what method is used and where that method comes from. Even the results of sūtra and tantra are not the equivalent. For example, there is no discussion in sūtra of the seven limbs of the three kāyas — this is purely related to the result, mahāmudra. Just as for example, one can find only four wisdoms in sūtra, but there are five wisdoms mentioned in Vajrayāna, in sūtra the word "Vajradhara" is never heard, and likewise, the term "mahāmudra" does not occur even once. If you are going to say there is mahāmudra in sūtra, why stop there? Why not say there is a sutra connate bliss, a sūtra Dzogchen, a sūtra tummo, a sūtra consort practice, none of which require empowerments?

Well, you see this is the problem, because there are actually no scriptures which support such a notion.

If someone asserts there is an actual mahāmudra result outside of the practice of the two stages or guru yoga, that person is mistaken, regardless of their title, position or rank. 

If the introduction to the nature of mind occurs outside the context of having received the four empowerments, that instruction does not go beyond prajñāpāramita meditation —&nbsp;which is a perfectly fine practice, but it is not mahāmudra. It is something like calling an ordinary geshe a "buddha" in order to arouse faith in his disciples.

If the introduction to the nature of the mind happens on the basis of the four empowerments, that introduction can swiftly lead to the realization of mahāmudra, especially because that introduction is based on the example wisdom the disciple experiences during the ritual of the four empowerments at certain points. When that subsequent introduction is combined with completion stage practices such kumbhaka or the intense devotion of guru yoga, mahāmudra can be realized rapidly. However, meditating on the intimate instructions of mahāmudra divorced from completion stage practices and or the intense devotion of guru yoga is a slow path even if one has received the four empowerments in a proper way. If one has not received the four empowerments at all, the idea that one is going to realize mahāmudra is a completely hopeless fantasy, like wishing for a stone to be saturated with water because one leaves it in a pond.

It is in fact an important point. For example, if you go to a store and buy a Gucci suit, but you later find out that you have been sold a cheap knockoff, you will not be happy. Likewise, if you receive some information about Dharma somewhere, and then find you have been misled, you will not be happy. 

In general, you cannot practice the mahāmudra instructions of the Indian mahāsiddhas without a teacher. Even something like Gampopa's own system of the four yogas of Mahāmudra cannot be practiced without personal guidance from an experienced teacher.

I don't really think of it that way. Just because Sakya Pandita says something does not mean it has to be accepted. One must do one's research and see if what he or anyone says about anything has merit. 

These two ideas — that there is such a thing as mahāmudra in the sūtras, and that there is a mahāmudra path independent of Vajrayāna — are meritless delusions.

Sautrantikas measured the ideas of other schools in terms of whether they were justified on the basis of the Agamas or not. Where they were, they left them alone, where they were not, they criticized them. The Abhidharmakośa is a collection of mainly Sarvastivadin doctrines, the bhaṣyam is a critical commentary on those.

Mahāmudra is not a practice, it is a realization, a realization that comes from either practicing the two stages or guru yoga.

There is no such thing as mahāmudra in the sūtras. The term does not occur in sūtra at all, so how can it be a result in sūtra? This is just calling prajñāpāramitā "mahāmudra, but it is not real mahāmudra.

Yes, this is a mistaken tradition that cannot be defended in anyway whatsoever. Many have tried, none have succeeded, and this is why everyone who wishes to actually realize Mahāmudra has received empowerment and practiced the two stages, including Gampopa, and especially Tilopa, Naropa, Maitripa, Saraha, Shavaripa, you name it, all the Mahasiddhas of the past.

Because during the empowerment the guru recites all the main parts of the sadhana to create the disciple in the form of the deity, as well as the refuge and bodhicitta that we recite with the master, and he gives the transmission of the mantra and so forth. 

So yes, in general, if you have the empowerment, you have the lung.

Vajrasattva is a Vajrayāna practice; mandala offerings and guru yoga are practices unique to niruttarayoga tantra. Without receiving empowerment into a mandala such a Hevajra, Cakrasamvara and so on, there is no Mahāmudra to speak of, much less realize. He declares first that Mahāmudra is an independent path, and then second that that Vajrayāna practices are indispensable for Mahāmudra.

The Mahāyāna Sambhogakāya is visible only to 8th stage bodhisattvas on up. While lesser rainbow body is only observable through the sign of the shrinking of the body after death, the so called great transformation body, rainbow body attained while still alive, is visible to everyone. Only a small handful of practitioners have achieved this result. Most practitioners of Vajrayāna, regardless of tradition, attain Buddhahood during the bardo.

"Rainbow body" is a name for what happens when the elements of body reverts back to their original nature as pristine consciousness as a result of the process of Dzogchen practice or completion stage practice. A key point of Vajrayāna is that there is no buddhahood that is not grounded in the body. Hence, the attainment of rainbow body, or the body of light, is regarded as proof that a practitioner has attained buddhahood. This is never mentioned in sūtra because sūtra has no methods of practice that involve the body as a vehicle for awakening.

So what is the point of saying, "It is "the one having" these qualities which isn't."

When you make such statements, you are then forced to contradict yourself because you then have admit, "Conventional is."

Which all then results in nothing but pointless verbiage.
