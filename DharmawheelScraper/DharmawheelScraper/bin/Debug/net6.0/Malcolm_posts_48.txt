We do not have a Buddhist king who can advise people wisely. And I personally do not want a Socialist dictatorship directing my life. Perhaps it is because I am an American, and we Americans in general are pretty much historically opposed to Communism. Indeed, even when Socialism was popular in the US, it was popular mainly among first generations immigrants at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, not amongst those who had been born and bred here, and for the most part, second generation immigrants, horrified by the excesses of Stalin, eschewed it. 

The anti-facist Socialist idealism of the thirties in in the US pretty much died when we understood that there is structurally no difference between Marxist-Leninist Socialism and Fascism in terms of outcomes, both have planned economies, both use secret police to terrorize dissent, etc. 

85 people may own 1/2 the worlds wealth, but so what? They will die, inheritance taxes will be applied, this state of affairs is very impermanent. All we need to worried about is that our own wealth is gotten virtuously, without stealing it from another. 

And we need to understand that in general we cannot change the disparities between people since people have their own karma. This is the reason for example that Buddha did not give his golden alms bowl to a poor family living by a river because he saw that due to their latent afflictions they would all take rebirth in lower realms as a result of such a sudden influx of wealth. Of course, I am not Buddhist so I cannot predict anything, so I have no idea what would happen of 1/2 the world's wealth was suddenly "redistributed". But who would adjudicate it to make it fair?

Indeed, from the perspective of Madhyamaka a thing and its nature are identical. This is not so for those in lower schools. 

To elaborate, conditions are merely an appearance. The notion of conditioned and unconditioned arises out of the substantialist roots of the substantialist tenet systems. By showing that the essence of phenomena is unconditioned, you are essentially showing that phenomena are in truth unconditioned. This is why the Prajñāpāramita makes statements like:

 Any teaching by the Bhagavan that matter lacks inherent existence, does not arise, does not cease, is peace from the beginning and is parinirvana by nature, all such teaching are not the indirect meaning, nor the intentional meaning, but must be understood literally.

You see, Buddha wanted people to become wealthy. There are many places in the sutras where he gives recommendations for how laypeople may virtuously maximize their wealth. We have already established too that one's social position depends on one's karma, and therefore, one access to initial wealth and opportunity. Of course, we must try our best to extend opportunity to everyone. The construction of schools, hospitals, roads, etc., these things are costs society must bear for everyone's benefit. But it is impossible to provide everyone with the exact same economic parity. Some people are lazier than others. Some people are more talented than others. Some people are more industrious than others because of their karmic dispositions. In reality, social classes tend to driven by the five afflictions: the lower classes tend to be dominated by ignorance and desire, the middle classes tend to be dominated by desire and jealousy and the upper classes tend to be dominated by anger and pride (which is one reason why those from the upper classes tend to more easily fall into lower realms). 

You cannot regulate how people accumulate karma, and cannot fix people's karma by regulating society.

Not really. Why? Because some people have the karma to become super wealthy and others do not. Rather than bitching about the super wealthy, attend to your own causes of merit. 

When contrasted with the endowments of the beings of the deva realms, for example, all the wealth of the earth is just a pauper's bauble, the richest person is less than a beggar. 

But since you do not seem to have a view that takes into consideration the six realms of samsara, you are myopically focused on this human life and its endowments, focused on material relations rather than Dharma practice. The ability to practice Dharma is the true wealth of Jambudvipa. If you want to help beings in a concrete way, it is better to spread Dharma that things.

It means simply that when you examine dependently originated phenomena you cannot ascertain that they ever arose. A phenomena that never arose is defined as "unconditioned", for example, space, which is the primary metaphor used to describe the actual nature of things. Thus, when we examine phenomena for essences we cannot find one, because phenomena do not arise by virtue of an essence, they in fact, or in truth, never arise. This is what it means to say that conditioned phenomena possess an unconditioned nature, no more and no less. 

If conditioned phenomena possessed a conditioned nature, that nature would also have to arise, leading to dual arising for same phenomena, which is absurd. However, since conditioned phenomena possess an unconditioned nature their arising is only apparent, not actual, merely conventional, similar with an illusion, etc. This covers all qualms you may have.

Probably because most people in the West come to their political views fairly early in life, and Buddhism only later. Especially leftists have a bit of retrofitting to force Buddhism into a leftist model. 

This is why I am an advocate of deep ecology. Deep ecology does not require any retooling to fit with Dharma. It just requires an extension of rights to the biosphere as a whole, with the corresponding consequences of that, i.e. maintaining world population at levels that do not exceed the "income of the household" (impractical, I know, just saying).

This is a common myth. The historical facts are however that Tsongkhapa was  Sakyapa originally, studied at Sakya, and refers to himself as a Sakyapa in some early commentaries. Further, his two main students were Sakyapas. It is indeed true that since his first master was a Kadampa Geshe, he always maintain an obvious affection for Lam rim, but in his training he was a Sakyapa. Most of the transmissions in Gelug come through Sakya because it is a little know fact that the Sakyapas were and still are the richest school in terms of total number of gsar ma tantric lineages from India. Probably because they were among the wealthiest religious families in Tsang. The Kagyu sngags mdzod is quite small when compared to the rgyud sde kun bdus. 

Initially, Gelug was called Sakya gsar ma, i.e. new Sakyapas, until it was renamed Ganden pa after Tsongkhapa's monastery in Lhasa.  "dge lugs" is a corruption of i.e. dga' lugs, short for dga' ldan pa'i lugs, i.e. "the school of the dga' ldan pas." The proper name for the Gelug school is actually "Ri bo dga' ldan pas", those of Tushita Mountain. 

It is also true that Tsongkhapa received important transmissions from Drikung as well.

No, all human beings have notions of ownership, they simply are alien or do not correspond to the current Roman property law concepts of ownership that are actually at the root of the property law system which generally dominates capitalist countries. These societies generally instead have/had the concept of "right of use" (usufruct) for example, East Coast Native Americans in the Continental US, I.e. they would negotiate with each other about who would own the right to use this or that fishing ground, hunting territory and so on. It is true that ownership of these rights were very plastic, and could easily change since they were not tied to "property" as we understand the term, but also wars were waged when one tribe felt another tribe was violating their rights of use. 

At base, ownership is a concept that arises from the three afflictions, and more specifically the delusion "I" and "mine", and this is why as long as human beings are driven by afflictions, we always will move from simpler ownership paradigms, such as those of nomadic and semi-nomadic bands (usufruct rights) to the more complicated property-based economics of the grand civilizations of Europe, African, The Americas and Asia. We could conceivably move back to such a notion of usufruct, but only if there is a grand catastrophe involving a shocking reduction of population to levels that were current at the beginning of the agricultural epoch.

Shakya Chogden's view would have become the main view of the Sakya school but for a divination that was done in front of Four Faced Mahākala, the protector of the view in Sakya.

No, Yogacara/cittamatra insists forcefully that awareness/consciousness, whatever you want to the call it is individuated. There really is no Buddhist school that argues for an uniform uber-consciousness out of which individual consciousness are instantiated. 

Basically, folks like Tony Page really are faced two alternatives, either their "true self" is like Purusha of the Saṃkhya school, a totally unconditioned individuated knower, as opposed to the nonsentient evolutes of prakriti (buddhi, ahaṃkara, manas, five sense organs, five organs of action, the five subtle elements (sound, etc.) and the five coarse elements; or it is like brahmin of the Vedantins and so on. They really have only these two choices if they insist on a literal interpretation of the term "atman", bdag nyid in texts like the Nirvana Sutra and so on. 

In Saṃkhya there are an infinite number of purushas, while in Advaita, using the basic model of Saṃkhya, proposes that purusha and brahmin are synonymous and further, that there is only one purusha, and that further, prakriti and its evolutes are also included in purusha.

Yes, provided we act with wisdom and in accordance with the Dharma. If we abandon the Dharma by adhering to some non-Buddhist principles, we will come to nothing but grief. 

For example, if someone accumulates a great deal of money or property, this is a result of their karma. We can encourage them to use it in a socially responsible way, but if we "liberate" it for the "people", believing that a factory for example "belongs" to its workers, then we will be in for some very heavy negative karma of poverty in our future life. On the other hand, if we believe a factory is engaged in unfair practices, and we picket, and protest, appealing to the government to step in, there is no problem with this. Buddhist Vinaya has long established that in terms of matters of law, the civil law of the country you are in handles civil matters and must be obeyed. 

So, I am all for people trying to make the world a better place as long as they do so civilly, non-violently and without engaging in force to achieve their ends. I can understand when people react with extreme violence to heavy oppression, understand it, but this also is really just samsaric behavior. At a certain point in your life, you have to give up attachment to samsara and your own selfish liberation and instead cultivate bodhicitta and a view which is free from grasping.

The earlier sutta citation I provided for you comes from the Majjhima Nikāya. Clearly, Buddha there states that one's social position, whether high or low is a result of karma.

From the article you shared:

From the standpoint of karma, though, where we come from is old karma, over which we have no control. 

We only have control over where we are going, not what family we were born into and so on.

Like the Dalai Lama put it, there is a "white" gzhan stong" and a "black" gzhan stong. Following Rongton Shejya Kunrig, the former would be a transitional view between Yogacara and Madhyamaka, for in reality there is little difference between the false aspectarian Yogacara school in India (Ratnakarashanti) and gzhan stong. The latter black gzhan stong is pretty much heterodox from a Buddhist point of view. SOB adheres to the latter.

Specifically, modern Capitalism is a post colonial evolution based on the discovery of gold and silver in the Americas and so on. 

If you take the broader view, there have been many waves of capitalism since ancient history, like a trees in a forest, beings compete for resources, some are more effective at gathering resources, other's less. Eventually, the whole forest becomes moribund and is either replaced with new species of trees, or it dies altogether.

Yes, that would be consciousness, no matter what words you want to use, like awareness, etc., it is still consciousness. 

So, is your awareness undifferentiated or is it individuated, i.e. a personal continuum? If the former, your view is no different than Advaita. If the latter, that is acceptable within Buddhism.

Garbha means something that holds, what is being held, tathatā. Who holds tathatā? Sentient beings. 

Sugatagarbha is a short hand way of saying "the dharmakāya encased in afflictions". 

What becomes afflicted, clarity. What is the nature of clarity? Emptiness. Tathatāgarbha is just a way of saying that sentient beings have the potential for awakening because the mind and the mind essence are inseparable, the former conditioned and the latter unconditioned.

The term bdag nyid, atman, just means, in this case, "nature", i.e. referring to the nature of reality free from extremes as being permanent, blissful, pure and self. The luminosity of the mind is understood to be this. 

There are various ways to interpret the Uttaratantra and tathāgatagarbha doctrine, one way is definitive in meaning, the other is provisional, according to Gorampa Sonam Senge, thus the tathāgatagarbha sutras become definitive or provisional depending on how they are understood. He states:

In the context of showing the faults of a literal [interpretation] – it's equivalence with the Non-Buddhist Self is that the assertion of unique eternal all pervading cognizing awareness of the Saṃkhya, the unique eternal pristine clarity of the Pashupattis, the unique all pervading intellect of the Vaiśnavas, the impermanent condition, the measure of one’s body, in the permanent self-nature of the Jains, and the white, brilliant, shining pellet the size of an atom, existing in each individual’s heart of the Vedantins are the same. 

The definitive interpretation he renders as follows:

Therefor, the Sugatagarbha is defined as the union of clarity and emptiness but not simply emptiness without clarity, because that [kind of emptiness] is not suitable to be a basis for bondage and liberation. Also it is not simple clarity without emptiness, that is the conditioned part, because the Sugatagarbha is taught as unconditioned. 

Khyentse Wangpo, often cited as a gzhan stong pa, basically says that the treatises of Maitreya elucidate the luminosity of the mind, i.e. its purity, whereas Nāgarjuna's treatises illustrate the empty nature of the mind, and that these two together, luminosity and emptiness free from extremes are to be understood as noncontradictory, which we can understand from the famous Prajñāpāramita citation "There is no mind in the mind, the nature of the mind is luminosity".

Not of an entire group of people, but I would not be surprised if beneath the stereotype there was not some truth to it. In other words, I would not be surprised if indeed there were gangs of criminal Roma wandering around conning people and stealing. 

For example, there is the American TV show, The Richs, starring the English comedian Eddie Izzard, and the equally English actress Minnie Driver, who portray a family of Gypsies in the Deep South who engage in one scam after another until it all catches up with them.

Yes, the report states that assault rapes in Norway are overwhelmingly committed by people with non-Norwegian backgrounds. In the US, for example, apart from statutory rape, i.e. sleeping with a minor, there are no other kinds. I am quite sure that is what Norwegian is talking about, not the all the other kinds of rape defined under Norwegian law that would not even be recognized as rape, in for example, England. 

What Norwegian is talking about is the fact that the immigration and integration policies are such failures in Norway that these Norwegian policies are hugely lampooned by Norwegians in such shows as Lilyhammer.

I do not agree with Hayek, actually. You totally miss my point. My point is that capitalists must read Marx, and Marxists must read libertarians, etc. 

You should read Nozick, Rawls (main philosopher articulating social justice, and a large government to bring that about), Bookchin, Naess, etc. 

No one person's ideas are complete. It is folly to pick one person's book and say "This is my bible". One must read opposing views.

As I told you, my political beliefs are Deep Ecology/Left Biocentric and as a Buddhist I am committed to nonviolence, I cannot support any ideology which even permits the idea of violent revolutionary struggle. Naess has six principles for public debate which I generally adhere to naturally, but also fail at from time to time. They are:

Avoid tendentious irrelevance
Examples: Personal attacks, claims of opponents' motivation, explaining reasons for an argument.
Avoid tendentious quoting
Quotes should not be edited regarding the subject of the debate.
Avoid tendentious ambiguity
Ambiguity can be exploited to support criticism.
Avoid tendentious use of straw men
Assigning views to the opponent that he or she does not hold.
Avoid tendentious statements of fact
Information put forward should never be untrue or incomplete, and one should not withhold relevant information.
Avoid tendentious tone of presentation
Examples: irony, sarcasm, pejoratives, exaggeration, subtle (or open) threats.

These would be very good to adopt as personal commitments for online Buddhist discussions.

No, I am making a similar claim to the Marxists, i.e., that the capitalism founded by Smith had a moral theory. Likewise, Marxist style Socialism has a moral theory. 

In both cases the the beast unleashed has shaken off the collar of its moral theory every time. We all accept that the Soviet Union and Communist China represent the failure of Marx's theories of economics. No one can possibly claim that any capitalist government has murdered as many people as the communists did in the 20th century. Not even the Nazis murdered as many people as Stalin did alone. 

What we have is capitalism, we do not, at present, have another economic system.

The problems with all of these criticisms of capitalism is that they assume that all value comes solely from labor. This is fine for Smith, Ricardo and Marx, but in fact economists have found the LTV inadequate for explaining all kinds of things in economics. 

I guess one of the things I find annoying about the Marxist rank and file is their amateur economics, they all act as if they really understand economics, but what they really do is just recite chapter and verse. And what I also find is that they rarely read contrary points of view. For example, have you read Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia? Or Hayek? Even you will never agree with what these fellows say, they are just as smart, if not smarter than Marx and co. Time to expand your horizons.

Capitalism, as portrayed in Smith's Wealth of Nations, is also founded on moral principles. Indeed, the latter book must be read alongside Smith's Moral Sentiments. 

Please examine this:

However, the moral principles upon which Smith founds his vision of capitalism and a labor theory of value is not utopian. 

The point is while Smith's systems isn't perfect, indeed it is very 18th century, but to loudly proclaim capitalism hasn't any moral theory is grossly wrong.

We all agree in principle that everyone deserves a fair shake and that capitalism as it stands now has problems. However, what he does not agree with is violence and revolution, and you have yet to show one single Marxist revolution that has not degenerated into total bloodshed. 

Socialism and Marxism are not the same thing. There are many socialisms. Why a Buddhist picks the most evil materialist form of it is totally beyond understanding.

But beyond that, if you think a Marxist party should be in power, than vote one in. Good luck with that, because as far as I can tell, very few countries want that kind of Government.

I nowhere said that one needed to accept the class into which one was born. You can work hard, get an education and improve your circumstances honestly. 

What I said was that classes in society were a result of karma, not capitalism. 

Also when your socialist brigades begin stealing people's houses "for the people", and closing their bank accounts "for the people", etc., this is just stealing, and it is a non virtuous act. Nationalizing the banks is theft. Theft results in poverty, not prosperity. 

When you compare the Buddha's teachings with that of Marx, you will discover than nearly everything a revolution seeks to accomplish by Marxist methods are considered non-virtuous methods in Buddhadharma.

Incidentally, this does not mean that Buddhism regards modern capitalism as wise or virtuous, for it doesn't. It is just the other side of Marxist materialism. That was my point originally, you guys don't reject the capitalist means of production, you just want to own it. But it is that very means of production itself which is pernicious.

Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the condition, why inferiority and superiority are met with among human beings, among mankind? For one meets with short-lived and long-lived people, sick and healthy people, ugly and beautiful people, insignificant and influential people, poor and rich people, low-born and high-born people, stupid and wise people. What is the reason, what is the condition, why superiority and inferiority are met with among human beings, among mankind?"

3. "Student, beings are owners of kammas, heirs of kammas, they have kammas as their progenitor, kammas as their kin, kammas as their homing-place. It is kammas that differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiority."

http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/auth ... ml#shorter

Buddhism and Marxism are incompatible not least because their view of the creation of social classes is radically different. For Buddhists, social class is a result of karma. For Marxists, it is result of material relations. The two views cannot be reconciled.

No, it is karma that create class division. Any Buddhist should be able to understand this with ease. I think you really need to study the Buddha's teachings on karma more in depth. 

Class divisions existed long before capitalism, and will exist long after. The classes of the six realms were not created by capitalism. The various classes of animals were not created by capitalism. The classes of devas were not created by capitalism. etc. 

Antagonism results when people whose karma landed them in inferior positions become jealous and wish to take from others who are more fortunate [for example, just as the asuras became jealous of the devas]. Likewise, when those who are more fortunate act selfishly and do not properly care for the less fortunate, this too causes class antagonism [for example, when the devas refused to share ambrosia with the asuras].

Well, the easiest way to manage a general global population reduction would be subject parenting to licensure, which seems to me to be a good idea anyway. 

Drastic (peaceful) reductions in human population will ensure there are resources for many future generations of humans, plants and animals to come. It will ensure cultural diversity amongst humans, etc. There are no downsides, only upsides.

Ownership is an anthropocentric concept. It is not a biocentric concept. So your statement right there is flawed from a DE perspective. 

You will not achieve collective ownership ever. In order to bring that about you will have to fight a long, bloody war with billions dead. The notions of property rights are too deeply embedded in our legal systems. 

In order to change those you will have to overthrow entire governments and social orders. 

Basically, I prefer the present world order with all its warts and inconstancies to a world order that would be run by totalitarians such as yourself. You will kill billions in your idealogical zeal to create a "classless" society [but of course there are always classes and always elites]. It would be better for you just to pray for rebirth in a pure land, there are no classes there.  

Western Democracies at this point are too stable for your kind of revolutionary politics to ever be successful (Thank Buddha). The only reason why the Russian Revolution had a prayer of success is that the war footing of the western powers created serious economic instability worldwide. The same was true of China forty years later. 

The only solution to the world's problems is the abandonment of violence at all costs, and slowly educating people one person at a time. Inner evolution is the only key to the world's problems, not outer revolution.

I have nothing personal against Muslims. It is their karma to be born Muslims, with animal sacrifice as a major and important part of their religion. In my opinion, part of the reason that Islamic countries have such a high level of violence is that their religion condones animal sacrifice. There is an observable level of poverty and violence that afflicts every nation in which there is a major religion that sanctions animal sacrifice. This is one of the reasons why Southern Hemisphere countries have such problems. You might object, what about the 60 billion animals a year that are slaughtered for meat to feed the North? The karmic cause is different, therefore the effect is different.  

I have a lot of issues with both Islam and Christianity in general. They both are authors of great destruction and havoc in the world. I don't trust Islamic states, or indeed any religious state (including "Buddhist" ones) on any level in general. Thanks goodness one of the effects of the American Constitution was the elimination of state religions in Western Democracies for the most part. 

In fact, Marxism and Islam have many structural similarities, similarities noted by George Bataille in his work, The Accursed Share. You should read it.

It is not really a process of removing afflictions, it is more of a process of afflictions becoming undone on their own. 

Some people assert that the increase of the visions occurs separately from the karmic winds, using this as an example of why for example thogal is superior to other completion stage practices, but too is also not precisely correct. The movement of karmic vāyus in the body is a result of affliction, and it is precisely these that hinder the development of the thogal visions. The postures are meant to still these vāyus which is why you have to remain in them for long periods.

Because the term sems sde only begins to be used in the Vima sNying thig, and the later criticisms of sems sde from the point of sNying thig are more political than anything else. After all, Longchenpa's Chos dbying mdzod is pretty much a commentary on the view of the bodhicitta texts, but it is praised as being the dharmakāya in book form. 

In some respects, I am sympathetic to Astus's statement that man ngag sde is a return to "tantrism", but he has it slightly wrong. man ngag sde represents a desire to ground Dzogchen in its own completely independent system of empowerments, and one can see that it takes a page out of the Kalacakra system of the common four empowerments and then a system of the "higher four empowerments". Please do recall that famed Three Words of Garab Dorje did not even exist until the 1120's when the Vima Nyingthig was revealed by Zhangton Tashi Dorje. Prior to this was the seventeen tantra system of the four empowerments [elaborated, unelaborated, etc.]

I don't know the Kalacakra system well enough to opine about this; but in thogal the four visions appear not because the "natural" state is somehow lacking; they appear in their sequence because persons possess affliction and afflictions attenuate the visions as as they naturally unravel the visions first increase and then vanish. However, the idea that at the end of the four visions there are no appearances is a complete misconception. I will merely quote the beginning of Shabkar's discussion of the fourth vision on this point:

It so happens that in the past some Dzogchenpas
have asserted that the kāyas [visible forms] and wisdoms [expressed as the five lights]
do not exist within the state of original purity, but this is a great error.

Also Astus, the four yogas are sūtra mahāmudra. If you do not practice the completion stage, mahāmudra according to the upadeṥas is a slow path, or so it is asserted by the Sakyapas. This is the reason why vase breath is used extensively even in so called sems sde.

Oh definitely, DE is an intellectual movement in many respects. There is nothing to be gained by Deep Ecologists joining party politics. In the US Green Party, the DE voice has been completely suppressed by the Bookchin faction.

As David Orton points out:

Green parties have become shallow ecology defenders of industrial capitalist society, even if Arne Naess was supportive of them. The German Green Party theoretician Rudolf Bahro resigned from the party in the early 1980s, and pointed out that green party shallow ecology  is content to “brush the teeth” of industrial society. 

And:

There is arrogance among socialists who think that they should be leading the ecological movement, because they have a “class analysis” and are anti-capitalist. What comes across is that the Left believes it is entitled to intellectual hegemony in the green and environmental movements, by virtue of prior knowledge. The Left does not seem to be able to absorb the pluralism of green and environmental politics – as Naess informed us, “the front is long” – let alone accept the earned leadership of others by virtue of their practical or theoretical work. Ed Abbey noted, through the character Doc Sarvis in The Monkey Wrench Gang, the importance of practical involvement in actual environmental struggles: “Let our practice form our doctrine, thus assuring precise theoretical coherence.” (p. 68) The idea that deeper environmentalists and greens can come to an anti-capitalist critique based on their own experiences, without studying Marxism or social ecology, but based on field experience, seems, apparently, difficult to grasp for the Left.
http://deepgreenweb.blogspot.com/2011/0 ... tions.html

If you are curious as to what my "practical involvement in actual environmental struggles" are, it is precisely my study of traditional medicine, in part in inspired by the anarchist writer Laurel Luddites piece, Anarcho-herbalism:

Medicine is just one part of the machine that we have to take back and re-create into a form that works for the society we will become. Every herb, pill, and procedure should be judged on its sustainability and accessibility to small groups of people. 
http://www.swsbm.com/HOMEPAGE/Anarcho-herbalism.html

As for my definition of Marxism, Marxism, as we know, is a failure. Of course the Socialist revolutions of the early 20th century were important in their contributions to shorter work days, etc., all kinds of things we take for granted today in modern post-industrial countries. 

But the issue here is defining those features that make Marxism an unsuitable political philosophy for Buddhists. Its advocacy of violence is one reason, the trenchant materialism of the majority of Marxist philosophers is another. 

We really do need to get beyond these eighteenth and nineteenth century political models. That is what Deep Ecology is for.

If you participate in a violent revolution, advocating its aims, causing people, etc., to die, you will assuredly take rebirth in a lower realm. As Marx states:

The purposeless massacres perpetrated since the June and October events, the tedious offering of sacrifices since February and March, the very cannibalism of the counterrevolution will convince the nations that there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.
http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/wo ... /11/06.htm

There can never be any harm to anyone through following ahimsa. Non-violent struggles based on ahimsa will never bring harm to anyone. People engaged in non-violent protest may be harmed, but such protest will never being harm to others. 

Then there is the knotty issue of associating with people who have a negative view of Buddhadharma. It is not consistent with one's commitment of refuge to the Sangha to associate with those who are hostile or negative towards Buddhadharma. Therefore, since Marxism is avowedly an enemy of Dharma, as it is the enemy of all religion, it is not appropriate for Buddhists to belong to Marxist political parties (indeed, it is probably better we don't belong to any political parties at all).

From a Tibetan medical perspective, emotional disorders must be distinguished from actual psychiatric disorders. The former are fundamentally caused by imbalances in the three humors which arise from the three afflictive emotions. The latter are caused by very serious derangement of either "vata" or "pitta", along with demons. For the most part, the mental illness chapters cover various kinds of demonic causes.

Go Deep:


The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.
Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital human needs.
The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.
Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.
Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.
Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

The fact you take ālaya as the ālayavijñāna is an (understandable) error in your translation (not to mention rendering ālaya as "storehouse"). There is no evidence from the Tibetan text that such a literal reading is warranted. 

Finally, in both translations, neither of you have rendered "gnas su dag" perfectly. Hence it would be better to render it as "the purified ālaya is...", "the purified afflicted mind is...". 

My point is that there is no such a thing as a finished translation, and all translations are subject to scrutiny and correction, as well as differences of opinion.

Lapis on the other thand is very clearly the stone called mu men (མུ་མེན). Please consult འཁྲུངས་དཔེ་དྲི་མེད་ཤེལ་གྱི་མེ་ལོན་ -- this is the standard text reference for materia medica used in Tibetan Medical colleges.

Your reference about beryl is possible, but not definitive.

I should also add, that the word is a generic name for gems that are very shiny and catch light in very specific ways, for example, cat's eye (chrysoberyl) is also called Vaidurya. 

Here however it is བཻདུརྱ་སྔོན་པོ༷, which is in fact star sapphire, as opposed to the more common indranila, regular blue sapphire.

Abhidharmakoshabhasyam, AFAIK, there is no different explanation given in Yogacara or for that matter in the Abhidharmasammucaya. You can understand it in the following way: without physical organs, the mental organ can only have a single object present before it, the thought that propels its rebirth into that āyatana. 

You see, this is why people should study Vasubandhu in detail -- then they will have less proliferation and speculation about many things.

The function of vijñāna is really best comprehended by understand the complete presentation of skandhas, āyatanas and dhātus. There is no significant different between how these are presented in the Vibhanga, for example, and the Koshabhasyaṃ. 

In both systems, manovijn̄ānadhātu arises from the contact of the mano-indriya dhātu and the dharmadhātu.

12 āyatanas, the manoāyatana covers all sense perceptions because the emphasis is different. 

In brief, the emphasis of the presentation of 5 skandhas is on the sense organs, the presentation of the 12 āyatanas emphasizes the sense objects, and the presentation of the 18 dhātus emphasizes the sense consciousnesses.

Mental objects are one class of objects, material objects are another class of objects. You are conflating the two. A mental object (part of the dharmadhātu) is an object for the mano dhātu. A material object is an object for the other five dhātus, form for eye, etc. 

When for example the manodhātu meets an object that is part of dharmadhātu, a manovijñāna is generated. Before a vijñāna can be generated, the object must appear to the appropriate sense organ (indriya). 

When the cakṣudhātu meets the rūpadhātu a cakṣuvijñāna is generated. If it were the case that there are only mental objects any sense consciousness could arise from any sense objects, for example, cognition of smell could arise from the eye dhātu meeting the form dhātu, etc. 

It is not the intention of Madhyamaka to undermine this or that conventional presentation of the skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas, but merely to show that they are not paramārtha dharmas. 

Of course, as I said, if you prefer to follow the Yogacara presentation of conventional truth that's ok with me, but it was rejected by Candra.

Yeah, many people over the years try to make this distinction, but I think it is a reach. 

As far as I am concerned reincarnation and rebirth mean the same thing. 

In reality, the term in Sanskrit is punarbhāva, which literally means "repeated existence". 

For eternalists, this "repeated existence" happens because of an essence, as you rightly observe. For us, it happens because of continuing nexus of action and affliction. In both case, a body is appropriated repeatedly, hence they are both theories of reincarnation. In both cases, one is born repeatedly, hence they are both theories of rebirth.

It is pretty straightforward: you need to have interest, diligence, etc., for direct introduction to be of any real use. If you have interest, diligence, etc., it undoubtedly works. These eight indriyas beginning with sraddha are path dharmas yes? Since this is so, they are necessary for being on a path, even a Dzogchen path. Also this was never disputed. 

Direct introduction is what it claims to be: a direct introduction to your own state of liberation. You have always had that state, otherwise, you could not be introduced to it. This is why the state of liberation itself is not produced from causes -- it is innate. If it were not innate, if it were something created from causes and conditions, it would be perishable, and therefore, Buddhahood would be something temporary, part of the six lokas 

The path of Dzogchen is exactly what it claims to be: a path upon which there is no progress since the state of liberation is introduced to oneself from the start; the sole stage since all living beings are on it; the result that does not arise from a cause, etc. 

If you want to understand Dzogchen concretely, you need to study and practice Dzogchen.

If you are a Yogacara, you only need a mental organ (and traces, etc.). If you are a Madhyamaka, however, you need a sense organ in order to have a cognition of an object. For example, Candra's definition of the two kinds of relative truth explicitly depends on possessing a healthy or defective sense organ. 

Its ok with me if you want to abandon Madhyamaka, but it is a little surprising to see a Gelugpa do so.

The assertion that appearances and objects are identical is mistaken. If this were the case, there could be no common basis for the imputation of liquids by beings of the six realms.

There can be no subjective pole without the establishment of an objective pole. Therefor it is reasonable to assume that in addition to mind, external objects are required for appearances. You are placing all the primacy of this arrangement on mind. But equal weight must be given to the object and sense organ. For example, a blind man can not see color. He cannot even have the appearance of color. We can see color, he cannot. We can see color because all three things required for a cognition of color are present, an undeluded mind, a healthy sense organ and an external object. Madhyamakas in this respect never make mind the primary factor in cognition because that mind cannot even arise in absence of the object and the organ. So in this respect, you have to admit that the appearance is also dependent on the organ and the object, not just the mind.

A mind will not  find any appearances independent of itself, since it is axiomatic that all appearances to a mind belong to that mind, whether veridical or deluded. 

On the other hand it is clear Candra accepts external things from the following statement in the commentary to Intro to the Middle Way: "The intrinsic nature of all external things is of two types, relative and ultimate."

Since a cognition of an object (which is what an appearance is) cannot arise in absence of an object external to the mind (according to Candra, recall any sense cognition requires the meeting of three things, a mind, an organ and object), it is suitable to infer that there are phenomena external to the mind, such as thunderstorms and so on. Even in the case of the appearance of the six realms there must be an object (for example, a liquid) which can form the basis of the six kinds of imputations of water, ambrosia, etc.

As far as I am personally concerned, it matters little to me whether you wish to take the Yogacara view of relative truth, which you are advocating here, or the Sautrantika view  of relative truth which is the POV advocated by most Indian Madhyamakas including Candra (for whom objects are held to be external to the mind arising through their own causes and conditions, albeit not necessarily karmic causes and conditions). 

I already clarified that for Yogacara in general all appearances are generated by the activation of traces from past karma. It is a nice theory, but not one that finds much favor in Madhyamaka until Shantarakshita's Yogacara Madhyamaka synthesis.

The essence itself is Dzogchen. Dzogchen does not depend on direct introduction. If it did, it would be produced from causes and conditions. 

I already addressed this issue above, where I clarified that attaining a precious human birth certainly comes from gathering merit, etc.

In Dzogchen, buddhahood does not come from mind. The Dzogchen perspective is that a liberation based on causes and effects is incoherent.  

Dzogchen is a path where one abides in liberation, even if those moments of liberation are incredibly brief:

The suffering of samsara, cannot be removed by using this stake of grasping
but will be removed if [the stake is] let go. 
If fabricated phenomena are abandoned, one will achieve relaxation.

You must recall that Dzogchen is:

The result that does not arise from a cause
The intimate instruction that does not come from a text
The buddhahood that does not come from mind. 

Since Dzogchen is the result that does not come from a cause, how can we say that realization of one's natural state can come about from causes and conditions?

All Buddhists teachings have three prajñās: the prajñā of hearing, when one listens to the teachings and understands them intellectually; the prajñā of reflection, when one integrates what one has understood; and the prajñā of meditation, where the meaning one has gathered through hearing and reflection is brought to realization.

To claim that we are not meant to intellectually understand the path does not correspond with my education and training. The Tantra of the Union of the Sun and Moon states:

Prajñā is three-fold: the prajñā of hearing severs external reification; the prajñā of reflection severs internal reification; and the prajñā of meditation severs secret reification.

Vimalamitra states:

The characteristics of prajñā: 
The characteristic of the prajñā of hearing is a great quantity listening and understanding words without interpolation. 
The characteristic of reflection is investigating the words and meanings of the mind, and giving explanations. 
The characteristic of meditation is distancing oneself from afflictions through meditation. 



We should pay respect to intellectual learning, not dismiss it.

In reality, there are two Yogacara interpretations it seems.

Two: ālayavijñāna and the seeds are coterminous: exhausting the latter eliminates the former. This seems to be the position of Asanga in Mahāyāna Samgraha. 

The Nyingma approach to this is that there really are not nine consciousness at all. Consciousness derives its name based on its function in a given operation.

Well, actually, you have to accept that they are mundane because Buddhists and Hindus like are supposed to be able to manifest them with sufficient practice of Samadhi. 

None of these powers are transcendent in the least. 

What I am suggesting is that placing such impossible expectations on what can be expected of a realized individual makes it easy to spot fakes. For example, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu has said that if anyone of his students can place his hand in fire without beings harmed, ChNN would like to have that person as his teacher. Otherwise, he said, don't call yourself realized if you do not have power over the elements. 

Of course, the problem with this is that Hindus sages, etc., also claim to have power over the elements and so on.

 Thus, these things, power over the elements, the ability to swim through the earth, fly in the sky and so on, are a common stock set of magical abilities common in India literature. We need not take them literally any more than we take Meru literally. The pursuit of such abilities will not lead us to liberation, Buddha was exceptionally clear about this.

Just admit it, Sherab, you don't completely accept the Buddha's teaching "Where this exists, that exists". You don't completely accept "arising from conditions". 

The Tantra that I mentioned, the sku gdung 'bar ba, explains very precisely all the causes and conditions for the arising of the various types of things we call "ring srel" aka śariraṃ, i.e. relics. There really isn't a detailed explanation for these phenomena outside of Dzogchen tantras. 

Sakya Pandita says one must be cautious about relics: he doesn't rule out that they could be a result of realization, but he also observes that they could be mere formations of the four elements or even the artifices of demonic non-humans meant to deceive.

I am talking about the reports of Chinese Buddhist pilgrims in India. They do not report the same kinds of tales that Tibetan pilgrims four centuries later report. In fact, Sino-Japanese Vajrayāna interestingly also lacks the emphasis on stories of siddhas, coming from an earlier epoch in the development of Vajrayāna. Of course there are the stock in trade mundane siddhis mention in early tantras like the Susiddhikara and so on that we find common to both Hindu and Buddhist sources, like the eye salve siddhi for finding buried treasures and so on, these things are mentioned in texts translated into Chinese, but there does not seem to be the same obsession with subduing Hindus we find, for example, in the life story of Virupa, or the treasure bios of Padmasamabhava, etc.

ChNN himself has said the klong gsal teachings are not, technically speaking "gter ma". 

They are rmi chos, dream Dharmas, and as such, he has frequently admitted that he has a lot of capacity in this regard, which he has said manifested as a result of his contact with Rigzin Chanchub Dorje. 

My other main Dzogchen master, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, revealed gter mas on my front porch (2005), teachings which I hold in the highest regard. 

On the other hand, I have also found texts in famous terma cycles that are most definitely renovations of earlier texts (in one specific case I am thinking of, a text authored originally in the 12th century that also happens to be reported by Go Lotsawa by name] with "mis en scene" added for dramatic effect at the beginning. Robert Meyers and Cathy Cantwell's work on the treasures of Nyang ral Nyima Ozer are instructive in this regard as well. 

In the case of the treasure tradition, perhaps it is wise to take Guru Chowang's dictum to heart, i.e., the entire universe is a gter ma. This perspective solves a lot of teleological problems.

If you would bother to study what the Buddha says about this, he explains this very clearly. Merely because you are favored in this life with wealth, beauty and so on is no guarantee that you are going to be a nice person. Being born poor, destitute, and without opportunity does not guarantee you will turn to a life of crime. Thus, a person who seems to have all advantages has accumulated a lot of postive action in the past, but by engaging evil actions in this life they are exhausting their positive fortune in for future lives. A poor person who nevertheless is generous, kind and virtuous is creating positive actions that will ripen for them in terms of wealth, health and higher rebirth in the future.

First of all, we have to clarify which tenet system we are speaking from. 

So, from the Sautrantika pov,  the growth of inanimate things certainly depend on causes and conditions, but as they have no volition since they are living beings which possess only a material aggregate, their causes and conditions are not result of karma and they do not experience the ripening of karma because they are incapable of painful, pleasurable and indifferent feelings, which are necessarily the ripening of karma.

If it were the case that all causes were karma, there would be no purpose in first presenting the six causes and four conditions; then dependent origination and finally karma-vipaka. 

The general Yogacara presentation will maintain that the container universe appears to us because of traces we share -- there are no external trees, planets, and so on on "out there", their appearances being a mere ripening of the traces of the ālayavijñāna. 

Nāgārjuna too maintains that Karma is also volition and the results of those volitions. But he does not assert anywhere that I am aware of that all causes are karma.

Of course, how we sentient beings experience the container universe is precisely a ripening of our karma.

One thing that is escaping this discussion is that general buddhist concept of moments (relevant to Indian Buddhism in general from the Kosha) is actually based on the duration of a thought. That duration is something approximating 7 nanoseconds (it takes five nanoseconds for an impulse to travel across a neutron in the brain, longer for neurons in the body). This aside, Sapan's argument is pretty tight:

Because the three times do not arise at once,
the present moment is partless. 

This partless moment perishes as soon as its arises. It perishes immediately. 

Partless moments are possible precisely because the three times are not substantially established. 

Sapan maintains with respect to the question of whether such moments are ultimate or not,  "...it is not the ultimate free from proliferation because of being perishable; the ultimate of efficient capability, because in the context of the investigating the empirical conventional authority all delusion and non-delusion depends upon moments."

In the case of the continuum of mind, for example, this is possible because the present moment of mind is neither the same nor different nor different than the previous moment of mind, indeed it is the same with all series [see MMK, chapter on Samskaras]. The series of partless moments will cease as soon as the conditions supporting it cease. Hence, the only way a continuum is actually possible requires partless moments. If moments have parts, there is no way to ensure the continuation of any series, because moments will have parts, and thus causes and their effects will be different, and thus one will have a large series of negative consequences stemming from this.

A moment that has parts or duration leads to negative consequences  as shown by Nagarjuna. In other words, moments will have arising, duration, and cessation. If moments have these three, these three parts must also have parts and so on. In this case then you are left with an infinite regress. Not only that, you are left with a definition of moments in which all three, past, present and future must exist simultaneously. Otherwise a moments arising does not exist now, its ceasing does not exist now, and its present duration can only exist with duration because the duration of the present moment is merely a conceptual designation.

Actually, it is more like, Dzogchen (according to its texts) was taught by the primordial ultimate Buddha [ye nas don dam pa'i sangs rgyas]. Everything else by the relative Buddhas.

Yes, you can dogmatically assert this, but for example,if you wish to understand how the profound view of Vajrayāna is extraordinarily different from common Madhyamaka, then you must study the work of the Sakya master, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen, one of the founder masters of Sakya, who wrote an extensive refutation of those who apprehend emptiness as the intrinsic nature of all phenomena in his presentation of the abhisamaya of the Hevajra Tantra called The Precious Wish Fulfilling Tree, which also treats Prasanga Madhyamaka in its section on the four tenets. 

Of course it is rather pointless to tell you this, because even if you could read Tibetan you would not read this text with anything but a jaundiced eye.

I do however think that while Madhyamaka is the definitive sūtra view, the view of tantra in general goes beyond Madhyamaka.

Well, we were talking about sutra. 

Further, Dzogchen rejects the two truths, because relative "truth" is not true, being a deluded cognition. But Dzogchen does not reject appearances which appear to ignorance (ma rig pa).

Dzogchen substitutes vidyā and āvidyā (rig pa and ma rig pa) for the term "pāramārtha satya" and "samvṛitti satya". 

Also one will discover that Dzogchen, in rejecting the two truths, also rejects ultimate truth, as it states in The Mind Mirror of Samantabhadra:

Since there is no ultimate, also the name “relative” does not exist.

And as it says in Soaring Great Garuda:

Since phenomena and nonphenomena have always been merged and are inseparable,
there is no further need to explain an “ultimate phenomenon”.

So not only is the relative negated in Dzogchen, so is any concept of ultimate.

"Hidden" means what is not accessible to normal cognition, for example, atoms. In the case of supernormal phenomena, like power over the elements this is based on the cause of samadhi, and so on. In other words, without the realization of certain yogic skills, certain powers are not attainable. If these skills are attained, even though it may seem "miraculous" to the average person, nevertheless there is proper cause and condition governing the production of such phenomena on the relative level.

If you suggest that there can be production from dissimilar causes, a claim explicitly rejected in all Madhyamaka texts, you are allowing, for example, that unconditioned phenomena, for example God, can produce conditioned phenomena, for example, the world. 

I also gave you the example of the production of maize from wheat seeds, chickens from cows and so on. 

Since I have in fact answered all of your qualms in detail already, and am merely repeating answers I have already given, I can only conclude from this that you are incapable of actually reading my posts and will not longer respond to your questions about this.

The ultimate, from the Madhyamaka POV, is simply the absence of the four extremes in the relative. Also the ultimate does not exist according to any of the four extremes. The best you can say about the ultimate is that it is inexpressible.

No, Sakya Pandita was saying that partless moments were conventionally ultimate (as opposed to be ing the ultimate of the freedom from proliferation) because they have no duration and therefore they cannot be refuted by Madhyamaka reasonings (which only aims at particles that are conceived of has having duration).

Not necessarily. For example, Candra's milking a vow might have been an illusion generated by his capacity in rḍḍhipati. Buddha's ability to levitate to the height of fourteen palms trees is clearly based on his command over the four elements. 

All of these things have causes that seem miraculous to others since they do not see the inner workings of cause and condition. But I am quite certain Candra never obtained real milk from a picture of a cow. I am equally certain, since we know almost nothing of Candra from sources other than Tibetan (which conflate two Candrakīrtis anyway), that this is little more than a pedagogical legend, like most of these stories, which also generally have outer, inner and secret interpretations and generally cannot be taken at face value. 

My preferred Candra story is the one where after accidentally running into a pillar at Nalanda because he was looking at a book while walking, a student said "Ha, so that pillar is really "empty", isn't it?" 

To which Candra replied by passing his hand through the pillar. 

All conditioned phenomena arise from conditions. When we do not understand those conditions, we call those events "miracles".

If this is not the case, then we must consider Nagārjuna, and even the Buddha, liars for presenting miracles that violate the very principle of production from conditions.

It's pretty clear from Candra's language that there should be an object to be seen correctly or falsely. This means there must be an appearance about which one is either mistaken or unmistaken. When one unmistakenly sees the apparent objects which serves as the basis for imputation (hearkening back to your original qualm), depending on which strand of Tibetan Madhyamaka one is following:

a) the objects themselves do not actually arise in truth and are considered to be no more than illusions, and so on
b) the objects themselves arise from causes and conditions conventionally (i.e. not causelessly, from single causes, from self, other, or dissimilar causes). What objects do not do is arise inherently. 

Candra presupposes a Sautrantika epistemology where sense consciousnesses only arise when sense objects are encountered by contact with sense organs. For Candra, a sense consciousness will never arise in absence of a sense object or a sense organ, and this is clearly stated in the Madhyamakāvatara. Thus, the question of what the delusion actually is remains a matter of debate amongst Mādhyamika proponents. 

What we can see from all of this is that since "Mādhyamikas" cannot agree amongst themselves, not to mention the other three tenets, indeed the "science" of Buddhism has undergone much change and transformation, like any body of human knowledge.

It is worthwhile here to repost the master's own words from his own magnum opus, Prasannapāda:

Therefore, that being the case, here when the Bhagavan clarified the production of things depending on cause and condition, he refuted the production of things causelessly, from a single cause, a dissimilar cause, or generated by self and other. Since those were refuted, the intrinsic nature of relative things was taught according to how they exist relatively.

Please compare this with what I stated above:

Conventionally or relatively speaking, Candra eliminates arising without a cause, from single causes, dissimilar causes or from self or other, leaving only arising from conditions as the only valid option.

That object which is correctly seen is true,
that falsely seen is said to be relative truth. 
Also false seeing is held to be of two kinds:
a non-defective sense organ and a defective sense organ. 

He also says:

།རྐྱེན་ལས་བྱུང་ཕྱིར་ཁམས་གསུམ་པོ།

།དེ་ནི་དེ་ཡིས་སྟོང་ཉིད་གང༌།

Because of arising from conditions,
the three realms are conventionally ascertained to be conditioned. 
That [the three realms] which is empty of that [the inherent existence of the three realms];
that is said to be the emptiness of the conditioned.

In this case, all that the three realms are empty of here is inherent existence, here termed "the emptiness of the conditioned".

But what they are not empty of, according to Candra, is being conventionally designated as "conditioned" since the three realms are observed to arise from conditions. 

Thus, your thesis that Nāgārjuna rejects arising conventionally is not to be found in the thought of Candrakirti, etc.

Ultimately, yes; conventionally no, as passages by Buddhapalita and Candra demonstrated quite clearly.

You can deconstruct the two truths if you like, and certainly the two truths are rejected in Dzogchen; but not in Madhyamaka. And conventional truth in Madhyamaka clearly demonstrates the need for causation in order to have a sensible world where everything does not arise from everything at random.

Empty dharmas are entirely produced 
from dharmas strictly empty; 
dharmas without a self and [not] of a self.
Words, butter lamps, mirrors, seals,
fire crystals, seeds, sourness and echoes.
Although the aggregates are serially connected,
the wise are to comprehend nothing has transfered.
Someone, having conceived of annihilation,
even in extremely subtle existents,
he is not wise,
and will never see the meaning of ‘arisen from conditions’.

As Candra points out in the Prasannapāda:

Therefore, that being the case, here when the Bhagavan clarified the production of things depending on cause and condition, he refuted the production of things causelessly, from a single cause, a dissimilar cause, or generated by self and other. Since those were refuted, the intrinsic nature of relative things was taught according to how they exist relatively.

This is not a tetralemma, there is no fourth member. The third argument "Nothing...arises without a cause" serves to eliminate the idea that conventionally anything can arise from anything, as Buddhapalita, etc. clearly explain in their commentaries. 

Remember, when we are discussing conventionalities such as causality and arising, we are not doing so from the perspective of how things actually are, we are speaking strictly from the perspective of conventional truth. Buddhapalita at the end of the first chapter says "Because results, conditions, and non-conditions do not exist, descriptions for arising are merely conventional." No Madhyamaka maintains "There is no arising in conventional truth".

Now you may prefer Hume to Nāgārjuna, but don't conflate Hume's materialism with Nāgārjuna's presentation of ultimate truth. 

In fact, in every commentary around 13.6 preserves the necessity of a relationship between causes and their effects, i.e. asserting that from a Madhyamaka point of view, causal connection is necessary, for example, demonstrating how curd does not come from water because curd indeed comes from milk even though causes and effects can not be said to be the same nor different.

They are not refuted conventionally in MMK 1.1. 

"Nothing...arises without a cause..."

As Buddhapalita explains:

Also they do not arise without a cause, because the consequence would be that everything arising from everything permanently, and because there would be the fallacy of the purposelessness of all undertakings. Why is that so? Because the arising of existents is not accepted in all aspects, therefor, because there is no arising, the expression ‘arising’ is just a convention.

So even while we can refute arising ultimately, we must accept causes conventionally.

Nāgārjuna states:

also non-self was taught;
The buddhas have also said
"there is no self or nonself at all"

The commentary by Buddhapalita explains that Buddhas teach the existence of a self in order to prevent beings from falling into lower realms because they will then ignore the effects of positive and negative actions. Nonself is taught in order to counter attachment to samsara in general and to higher realms specifically. But, he adds, this two are illusions taught to guide the immature. Buddhapalita states that In reality, the buddhas teach neither self nor nonself.

As Rongzom points out, only Madhyamaka "harms" itself. 

The arising of appearances needs to explained in some way, hence MMK 1.1

At no time, no where
do things arise from self,
from other,
or without a cause. 

Madhyamaka serves to pacify proliferation through demonstrating dependent origination. This is the mangalaṃ of MMK states that dependent origination, unceasing, non-arising, etc., is the pacification of proliferation. 

From your given appearance, one might explain appearances arise causelessly [Carvaka], or from themselves [Saṃkhya], from other [Vaiṣeśika], etc. 

Nāgārjuna's project is twofold: one, to show that accounts of apparent phenomena other than dependent origination are unintelligible. Two, to show that dependently originated phenomena are empty. 

He does this because of the subject/predicate [dharmin/dharmatā] problem in discussing phenomena in terms of essences. The dharmin in this case is appearances which are dependently arisings. When their predicate is sought, their dharmatā, it is found to be emptiness. 

Since phenomena are found to be essenceless, they are likened to appearances that everyone accepts are unreal, i.e. illusions, apparitions, space and so on. 

The Madhyamaka project is to show that as long as one insists that there is an ultimate basis of imputation beyond mere appearances, for that long one will be locked into conceptuality. Since in the final analysis, one can find no basis of imputation at all, and since the object under analysis ceases to appear as either an existent or in this case as a non-existent (since a non-existent cannot be predicated without an existent), one ceases to conceive of things as existents or nonexistents. That is the desiderata. 

In the end it is very simple, this appearance, for example a sprout, depends on the appearance of that appearance, for example a seed; without the seed there is no sprout. This appearance, butter, depends on that appearance, milk., etc.

Dependent origination serves to explain causal processes without invoking essences. Dependent origination is something one can witness with one's own eyes, so in that sense it is not imputation, it is how things exist. In other words, at no time has anyone ever witnessed the arising of something that did not depend on a cause.

Not necessarily. Gelugpas accept the dharmadhātu, therefore, they accept a basis. For example, they accept the Āryākṣayamatinirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra as definitive. It states:

If it is asked what is the bodhisattva's skill in the elements [khams, dhātu], it is that which is the wisdom that engages the dharmadhātu. The dharmadhātu is the element of earth, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of solidity. The dharmadhātu is the element of water, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of wetness. The dharmadhātu is the element of fire, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of maturation. The dharmadhātu is the element of air, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of motility. The dharmadhātu is the element of the eye, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of sight...The dharmadhātu is the element of the body, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of touch. The dharmadhātu is the element of mind, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of perception [vijñāpti]. The dharmadhātu is the element of eye consciousness, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of of the specific perception of form...The dharmadhātu is the element of form, but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of the element of perception of an eye consciousness. The dharmadhātu is the element of phenomena [chos kyi khams, dharma dhātu, one of the eighteen dhātus], but the dharmadhātu is not the characteristic of the perception of phenomena...the dharmadhātu and the element of the self are the same. The dharmadhātu, the desire realm, form realm and formless realm are the same. The dharmadhātu and the element of samsara and the element of nirvana are the same. The dharmadhātu, the element of sentient beings the element of space and the element of all phenomena, those are the same. If it is asked why they are the same, because they are the same as emptiness, they are the same. 

This is the basis any Gelugpa can accept. 

This sutra also has a beautiful definition of wisdom as well:

If it is asked what is consciousness [vijñāna] and what is wisdom [jñāna], so called "consciousness" are the four abodes of consciousness. If it is asked what four, it is as follows: consciousness approaches matter, approaches sensation, approaches perception [samjñā] and approaches formations and abides. This is called "consciousness". If it is asked what is wisdom, whatever throughly knows the aggregate of consciousness in the four aggregates, this is called "wisdom". Moreover, consciousness is the earth element consciousness, the water element, the fire element and air element consciousness. This is called "consciousness". Whatever knows the consciousness that abides in these four elements to be inseparable with the dharmadhātu, this is called "wisdom".

It is sort of ridiculous to term gzhan stong "great madhyamaka" since it is a term used to describe several different positions amongst Tibetan Madhyamakas i.e. gzhan stong; the early Sakya/Nyingma view of free from extremes that goes right back to Kawa Paltseg, and of course Tsongkhapa's formulation. 

The Indian texts also show no consistency in how the term is used, the anonymous pramāṇavidhvaṃsanaṭippiṭakavṛtti refers to its adherents as "great madhyamaka" and rejects the so called cittamatra madhyamaka [that Bhava advocates in the passage you reference] as inferior. 

In reality, in the Indian context, "great madhyamaka is a term mostly used in tantric treatises; even here however it is used in various different ways. The Śrī-kālacakropadeśayogaṣaḍaṇgatantrapañjikā by Avadhutipāda states:

"The nature of the completion [stage] is said to be mahāmadhyamaka". 

On other hand, the Śrī-ḍākārṇavamahāyoginītantrarājasyaṭīkāvohitaṭikā by Padmavajra states:

So called "madhyamaka" is the dharma of the essence, the freedom from four extremes of the mahāmadhyamaka of the Mahāyāna and the awakening of the fortunate. 

Dombi Heruka's Śrīhevajrasādhana states:

One should mediate on the great madhyamaka free from all signs.

And the Tantric Candrakiriti's Samājābhisamayālaṃkāravṛtti states

Having manifested the mahāmadhyamaka that is like space,

Matter, mind and mental factors: dharmas the Abhidharmikas took to be pāramārtha dharmas. 

They posit the material aggregate upon the four elements which make up one's sense organs and their objects. Sensation, perception and formations are posited upon mental factors. The aggregate of consciousness is posited on past (manas), present (vijñāna) and future (citta) minds. 

Matter is then posited on particles (described in various ways). Mind and mental factors are posited upon moments. 

At this point the whole system becomes realist. The corrective for that is the two truths as presented in Mahāyāna.

I didn't say that Tibetan Buddhists needed to get rid of anything. I am pointing out that many Tibetan Buddhist beliefs need to be understood as nonfalsifiable.

Inferentially, because many potential "converts" are attracted to Buddhism because of its supposed rationalism, forms like Vipassana are more likely to fit it with the dominant worldview in the West and therefore gain much wider currency. Just look at how the term "mindfulness" has been expropriated from Buddhism. Of course there will always be folks who are attracted to Tibetan Buddhism precisely because of its supernatural elements. But those beliefs are not likely to sustain the transmission of Dharma in the Industrialized West. We do not, for example, see magical duels between Buddhist siddhas and Catholic priests.

Reacting to a crisis is not the same thing as overcoming a crisis. Thus, I must disagree with your assessment. 

Buddhism as a whole has a somewhat better chance of dealing with the crisis of modernity because it was reconstructed as a "science" in the late 19th century, with Theravada largely jumping on this bandwagon early on. 

Tibetan Buddhism on the other hand is, at present, the least well equipped to deal with modernity because it has layers and layers of metaphysical developments due to it being the end product of 1300 years of the development and evolution of Buddhist thought in India (and of course, this includes the period between 650-1500 in Tibet itself and its unique permutations of basically Indic materials). 

Is this insurmountable? No, of course not. However, traditional Tibetan Buddhists will need to accommodate science into their world view.

"Ananda, if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to answer that there is a self, that would be conforming with those brahmans &amp; contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism [the view that there is an eternal, unchanging soul]. If I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self — were to answer that there is no self, that would be conforming with those brahmans &amp; contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism [the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness]. If I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to answer that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not-self?"

"No, lord."

"And if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self — were to answer that there is no self, the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered: 'Does the self I used to have now not exist?'"

And this is a nice one:

"It's just as when a dog is tied by a leash to a post or stake: If it walks, it walks right around that post or stake. If it stands, it stands right next to that post or stake. If it sits, it sits right next to that post or stake. If it lies down, it lies down right next to that post or stake.

"In the same way, an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person regards form as: 'This is mine, this is my self, this is what I am.' He regards feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness as: 'This is mine, this is my self, this is what I am.' If he walks, he walks right around these five clinging-aggregates. If he stands, he stands right next to these five clinging-aggregates. If he sits, he sits right next to these five clinging-aggregates. If he lies down, he lies down right next to these five clinging-aggregates. Thus one should reflect on one's mind with every moment: 'For a long time has this mind been defiled by passion, aversion, &amp; delusion.' From the defilement of the mind are beings defiled. From the purification of the mind are beings purified.

Conventionally, there is a self, there is birth, there is death, and rebirth. Conventionally, there is also karma. Ultimately there is no self, no birth, no death, no rebirth, and also no karma.

The lifespan of human beings is considered to be about 80 years.

Not yet...Jean Luc Achard has apparently rendered the whole in French however. I am slowly working on it, and have let the SSI translators know this. So who knows, perhaps my draft will someday become the basis for a publication. But I have completed less than 10 percent.

Indeed, the concept that this or that form of Buddhadharma is being practiced in some other world system than our own is not an innovation of Dzogchen texts, but appears in Mahāyāna texts from an early time.

Content:
This tantra is a sprawling text that cannot be correctly read without the aid of a commentary. 

It presents the entire path of Dzogchen, embryology, cosmology, etc.

Even if one were to learn Tibetan, a classical education in the five classical sciences is a requirement to actually understand any of these texts.

Tibetan Buddhists could take some lessons from Derrida, etc. It might stave off a lot of naive beliefs about our textual traditions.

In any event, there is a long standing critical tradition with Tibetan Buddhism, the problem with it is that it is usually only applied to the other guy's books and not our own.

Well, the present day origin of Dzogchen teaching can be correlated to a physically identifiable place in the Universe and we are located on it. Otherwise, since most Mahāyāna practitioners who are familiar with the accounts of the universe, for example, as presented in the opening chapters of the Avatamska sutras will have no problem with the idea of the existence of planets in other solar systems and civilizations which exist in them. Nor for that matter will Star Wars fans be that suprised:

 

In any case, the first chapter of the sgra thal gyur identifies 13 buddhafields where Dzogchen is practiced. The introduction to the The Supreme Source discusses these in much detail. 

It should be noted however that in terms of textual history, there is no mention anywhere of this concept in Tibetan literature which can be reliably dated earlier than the sgra thal rgyur itself, which most likely was compiled between the 10th and 11th centuries.

Science does not reject metaphysical claims, it simply is not equipped to deal with them. 

Scientific methodology cannot verify non-falsifiable phenomena (such as karma, rebirth, God, etc.) because they cannot be tested and reproduced. Nonfalsifiabiluty does not render something false, merely untestable at present.

"Science" is an open-ended iterative method of inquiry into physical reality. Scientism is a belief system, which includes metaphysical beliefs, constructed out of the findings of the former.

Religions give an illusion of certainty. And of course they contradict each on other on every detail. 

Science (as opposed to Scientism) is always "...there is still a lot yet that we don't know".

Buddhas do not possess vijñāna; they possess only jñāna. This is a point poorly understood by most. 

In any case, you admit that Candrakirti's verse states that all objects of knowledge are burnt by the fire of wisdom. Even you must admit a mind cannot arise in absence of an object. If there are no objects for a Buddha (as indicated by the verse above), how can a mind  (citta) arise, conceptual or otherwise? Therefore, to call the wisdom of a Buddha a "mind" is at best a convention. A Buddha's mind is an omniscient nonconceptual wisdom. 

Nāgarjuna states for example in the Sixty Verses of Reasonings:

When reflection-like things
are seen fully with the eye of wisdom, 
those great beings
will not be stuck in the swamp of objects.

When there is no attachment, since there is no attachment to or engagement to those things as a self, there is no attachment to the swamp of objects. āryas are conventionally "like [those ones who have] trained their minds on reflections".

I don't see Buddhadharma and scientific inquiry as being inherently in conflict.

Buddhism and Scientism on the other hand, are bound to be in conflict.

Of course, I know this. But this is a mere sectarian definition. And this does not make the Buddhist definition true and the eternalist definition false. 

In short, all of these beliefs are just mediated by some book someone chooses to believe as opposed to some other books they choose not to believe. 

When I say that I "don't beleive" in Sukhavati, what I mean is that I am agnostic about it. I will admit though that there is certain a poetic quality to the mandalas through which the Sukhavati and so on are described. However, remove the Buddhist context and these paradises very are very similar. 

And of course there are some unappealingly sexist aspects to the Sukhavati teachings as well as such as:

"[A]fter any woman hears my name, rouses full faith and generates the mind to awaken, she will condemn the female body, and after exchanging those at that time, should she take a female body twice, I shall not attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi."

Of course, we can understand such attitudes to be symptomatic of the age. But if we take that approach, what else should we not just regard as cultural relics? 

The doctrine of buddhakṣetras is of course deeply embedded in Mahāyāna Buddhist teachings from a very early period and pervades every Mahāyāna teaching including Dzogchen. 

I personally think the motivation for developing such teachings comes as an early response to the doctrine that full buddhahood requires three incalculable eons to attain, i.e. imagining a place in which an ordinary person can find bliss and ease to practice dharma without having to be an 8th stage bodhisattva (required for rebirth in Akaniṣtha Gaṇḍavyuha)

Have you met someone who has returned from Sukhavati and reported on it to you?

While there are certainly some results we can confirm in this triple realm, rebirth in realms outside the three realms is not something we can ascertain personally. So we either take them on faith, actively disbelieve, or remain agnostic regarding them.
