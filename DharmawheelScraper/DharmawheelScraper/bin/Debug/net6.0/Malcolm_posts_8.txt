Not just a ritual. It is misunderstandings like this that cause harm to the teachings. 

There is no guru in Vajrayāna without empowerment, and there is no authorization to explain the details of Vajrayāna practice at all to someone who has not received empowerment. The Mahāmudrātilaka make this abundantly clear:

First, once empowerments are conferred
upon the disciple,
at that time the great secret may be explained
because they have become suitable recipients.

If there is no empowerment, there will be no siddhi,
just as there is no oil from pressing sand. 

When someone arrogantly explicates
the collection of tantras to one lacking empowerment,
both master and disciple will go to hell
as soon as they die, even if they attained siddhi.

People are often confused about this point, and think that only one guru can be a root guru or mūlaguru. In reality, any qualified person from whom one has received the four empowerments in a proper way is one's root guru. 

In Nyingma and Kagyu circles is common to understand that one's principle guru is the person from whom one has received definitive instructions through which one has understood the nature of the mind. The Sakyapas and others talk about one's karmically linked root guru as being one's principle guru, which has the same meaning as the Nyingma/Kagyu idea. 

Some people think that their root guru is the person from whom they received refuge, this is another common misunderstanding. Some people in organizations like Shambhala, are encouraged to think dead teachers like Trungpa are their root guru, thus adding more confusion to the pot. Some people think they can just pick a famous figure, like HHDL, the Karmapa, etc., to be their root guru without having ever received teachings from them, but this is yet another misunderstanding. 

All of this confusion comes about from not studying proper commentaries like the 50 Verses on guru devotion, and other texts.

Neither permissible, valid, nor taught in any tantra.

A root guru is a person from whom one has at minimum received empowerments. No empowerment, no guru.

Perhaps because you still have not defined what you mean by “direct knowing.”

Direct perceptions are, in ordinary people only the consciousnesses of the five physical senses. 

Yogis have different capacities, called abhijnana, “higher or direct knowing,” Knowledge past lives, etc. these are also five in number. 

The sixth, unique to Buddhists, is insight.

So, are you talking about yogapratyakṣa? If so, what inhibits this is traces of ignorance, which is why the yogic direct perception of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is incapable ot realizing all objects of knowledge due to the presence of traces of ignorance. 

Generally, however, pratyakṣa is confined to the five sense because manas is always a cognition of a direct perception of the five sense bases, aka a simple impression. 

Yogic direct perception is a personal intuition (pratyatmyavit), not an ordinary direct perception, for example the direct perception of a hawk hunting mice.

The point is that where the line is drawn between sentience/nonsentience is very ambiguous. If oysters can't think, etc., they are not sentient. I don't think they can think, YMMV. I don't think they possess minds. The Buddha is not around to ask anymore.

People complain mostly about eating things that have faces. There are massive environmental benefits in oyster farming, and they provide a pain-free source of animal protein. Oysters have no central nervous system and no sense organs, so they do not feel pain; and like plants, they respond to temperature and other environmental factors for feeding, breeding, etc. They may technically belong to the animal kingdom, but they are not sentient in any meaningful way. If it is argued they have sexual reproduction, so do plants.

Sakya Pandit complained in the 13th century about this view in Illuminating the Muni's Intent:

Here someone claims, “If one obtains a medical diagnosis, recites texts and so on, one will have no confidence in the jewel of the Dharma. Having obtained a medical diagnosis, it is best to then go for refuge to the Three Jewels. One will damage one’s refuge in the Three Jewels if one takes medicine.” 

In that case, it is said in the Bhaisayavastu of the Vinayāgama that doctors and medicines are to be relied upon by sick bhikṣus. Since food and drink are included together in the four kinds of medicine, if one eats or drinks one will be damaging one’s refuge. Therefore, just as one eats and drinks, how can it be reasonable to claim “One harms one’s going for refuge if one takes medicine?” If a scholar sees this, he will be disgusted. 

So, it has been around for a long time...

Any one who has actually studied these questions knows that the depiction of the rise of Vajrayāna as a Hinduization of Buddhism is silly. If it is true, then since all the name of a stupa correspond to parts of the classic brahmin burnt offering precinct, Buddhism has been "Hinduized," to use a coarse appellation, from the start. 

The fact of the matter is that without Buddhism, there would be no modern Hinduism (Gaudapāda, etc.). All of these tradition coevolved, and the common people, well, they just followed whatever the king told them to follow.

I wasn't referring to the distinction between an avatāra and a nirmāṇa. Both are docetic in nature. I was referring the obvious adherence by Buddhists to standard forms of Indian mythopeia, the use of common tropes, which indeed can include avatāric themes, such as Rudra Cakravartin's aka Kalki, defeat of the mlecchas in the final battle to restore world peace from mleccha domination, after the latter attack Shambhala; or the taming of Mahādeva by Śrī Heruka in the Cakrasaṃvara literature or the taming of Rudra found in the lower tantras, etc., in which these beings initiated an age of chaos and inequity, requiring Vajradhara to step in and intervene, etc.

So, still Team Indra.

Its true that the Bonpos work in some Iranian themes into their quasi-Buddhist mythopeia, and that the Chinese and Japanese work in native cultural themes into their mythopeia, and there is indeed some reason to think that the Iranian "paradise", that is the walled garden, may have some influence on the conception and depiction of Sukhavati. Nevertheless, Indian mythopeia is so strong a current wherever Buddhism spread from India that it completely dominates the local myths, which only survive through being appropriated, like domestic animals.

Content:
This kind of discussion between practitioners of Chan and practitioners of Vajrayāna are not that fruitful. The principle reason is that Vajrayāna practitioners, following Indian Mahāyāna precedents, make very clear distinctions between the paths below and above the path of seeing, and categorize experiences accordingly. So to us, the idea that one's awakening can be eroded does not make any sense. If it can be eroded, it is not awakening, but rather a peak on the path of application, which itself has four stages: heat, peak, patience, highest mundane phenomena. The last, highest mundane phenomena, is where one rests prior to making the final breakthrough on the path of seeing. Once one has obtained the path of seeing, it is impossible that one's awakening can be eroded at all in this life, and in future lives, if and when one meets the path again, one will swiftly recapture this awakening, though it might be thousands of years hence. Nevertheless, such people who have woken up once in past lives will be characterized by uncommon compassion and selflessness in deed, their minds "perfumed" by the realization of emptiness. But they will not realize emptiness again until they meet the Mahāyāna Dharma again.

As for your question, yes the vidyā that grasps characteristics is faulty, not intrinsically, but merely because it is consciousness which grasps outer and inner objects.

Using the presence of pan-Indian cultural themes and tropes in Buddhism to explain away the demise of Buddhism in India is lazy scholarship.

This is just consciousness. Otherwise, you are proposing a consciousness which does not belong to the six or eight consciousnesses and this is erroneous. 

Consciousness is not necessarily dualistic. When you subtract "vi" from "jñāna" you only have jñāna as a remainder. But this still is not outside the manodhātu.

And of course, you are misrepresenting the Pope himself:

The fact is that this all began when a Catholic Activist, Alexander Tschugguel, threw a statue of Pachamamma into the Tiber that had been installed by the bishops of the Amazonian Synod themselves. Francis didn't put it there, they did.

The basic list is pretty simple:

The basic tantra for Sakya and Kagyu is Hevajra. The basic tantra for Geluk is Guhyasamāja. The basic tantra for Nyingma, as you have identified, is Guhyagarbha. The basic tantra for Jonang is Kālacakra. 

The monastic curriculum for study is pretty much the same for all schools: Nagārjuna, Candra, Śantideva; the five treatises of Maitreya (in varying degrees); Abhidharma of Vasubandhu and Asanga; the Abhisamayālaṃkara commentaries of Vimuktisena and Haribhadra; Dignaga and Dharmakīrti's epistemology, and the Vinayasūtra of Gunbhadra and commentaries. 

In terms of practice cycles: for Sakya it is Hevajra and Naropa's Khecari. For Geluk, Guhyasamāja, Cakrasamvara and Vajrabhairava. For Kagyu, Cakrasamvara and Vajrayogini of various traditions from specific subschool to the next; for Nyingma, too many different practice traditions to mention.  Jonang, Kālacakra and the six limb yoga. 

Then of course there are many hundreds of practices which wind through all schools. So, it is pretty hard to quantify.

Its kind of like white fragility amongst white conservatives—constantly accusing liberals of brittleness, when in reality it is they who are brittle, when their cherished icons are found wanting.

I also find it of interest that the most arch conservative voices in all of this come from establishment Nyingmapas, who, of course, are the least conservative when it actually comes to innovations. One detects a little insecurity there? I imagine they must freak out when they hear that Chogyal Namkhai Norbu dismissed the notion that every word attributed to Guru Rinpoche in the Rinchen Terdzo, for example, could actually have been set down or spoken by Guru Rinpoche. He didn't give a percentage...he just said that it was impossible that it all could possibly come from Padmasambhava. 

This is why harping on "This one and that one is a terton" really makes no sense. Of course, if a terma does not contradict the teachings of the Buddha, there is no reason to immediately condemn it and say, "This is a false Dharma," as long as it is correct in its essentials; the same goes with dream teachings, pure visions, and the like, which are found in ALL schools. I also practice termas, so I am not criticizing termas per se (most of the Sakya and Nyingma sadhanas in my cyclical practice regimen were composed by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo). But I am critiquing the constant refrain heard here that the conduct of tertons is absolutely beyond all judgement. This is just gaslighting.

Romans were not so as much interested in conquest as they were in land and defense. Thus began with the Celts launching raids against Rome beginning 390 bc. Then there was the era of the Punic wars, etc. But during this period Rome did not actually subjugate their defeated enemies, they just forced them to pay tributes. The period of garrisoning Roman troops in conquered lands really didn’t begin until the end of the Republic, and the rise of the Imperium, but even here, Romans were generally more like raiders than conquerors. They really didn’t have a program to spread their culture to other nations, unlike ideologically motivated theists such as Christians and Muslims.

He certainly never condemned her, and even accepted her invitation to dinner:

Western Buddhism could use a bit of that right now. That's why I brought up Lha Lama Yeshe Ö. 

You seem to really get off on relating stories about teachers and their unconventional conduct. 

I prefer stories about truly great beings like Sapan, Longchenpa, Ngorchen, Tsongkhapa, etc. 

The stories of the Indian Mahāsiddhas often cannot be taken literally. That's why, for example, in the Caryagiti, the inner meaning of many of their dohas is exposed. 

Moreover, as I pointed out, both Virupa and Saraha poke fun at those who do not really understand the meaning of mahāmudra, etc., making fun of people who ape vratacaryā without understanding its purpose, which is to test one's own stability. And here, there are clear signs of when one is ready to begin that conduct. In the case of Tilopa and Naropa, Tilopa was testing Naropa's stability, since Naropa had been practicing Vajrayāna for years already. But frankly, to bring up Sogyal and Trungpa, their students had no stable equipoise to test, actually. Thus, presenting their actions as "unconventional behavior" in order to benefit their students, who I will remind you were by every measure beginners in the Dharma, is a false pretense, and a dangerous one. 

Frankly, I think that Tibetans as a whole have taken away, in many instances, the wrong message from their reception of the Mahāsiddha tradition. Not only that, but the fragmented way the Mahāsiddha tradition has been received by Western Buddhists has caused many of us to become deviants and enablers of deviants, excusing deviant behavior and lauding frauds as awakened beings because we really can't know who is and who isn't realized. That means depending on anyone's authority other than our own eyes and ears is a huge error. We can only observe whether someone's behavior and teachings correspond with the Dharma as it is taught in the sūtras or tantras or not. 

I refer frequently to Sapan's Three Vows because he gives clear instruction about how to evaluate anything that presents itself as Dharma. Of course, you won't read it, because it will offend you, since he questions everything that Tibetans do, apart from what is actually found in the sūtras and tantras and that which agrees with what is found in the sūtras and tantras. 

 You can claim until the cows come home that this master and that master is realized, but you don't know this from your own realization and clairvoyance. This is the main reason your missives, Sonam, and others like them, are such pious farces. 

We don't need outrageous "teachers." We need teachers who can guide people and train them to the level where their vajras and bells levitate in space and beyond. And we are not even talking about the Vajrayāna path of seeing here. 

Now of course, I assume that my principle gurus are realized beings. I am also sufficiently aware of my own limitations to understand that this is strictly for my own benefit, this is my concept. It is not an objective fact. This is why on the one hand I feel free to share my unfavorable opinion of Trungpa, Sogyal, etc., and on the other hand, encourage their students to maintain pure perception of them despite whatever opinion I may have, because as Peter pointed out, the former was a qualified vajrācarya, and as you pointed out, the latter did have a sound understanding of Dzogchen according to Nyoshul Khenpo, at least intellectually—and Dzogchen, like dependent origination, is not easy to understand. 

You on the other hand insist that the realization of this person and that person you mention is an objective fact, and that therefore, whatever they do is the action of a bodhisattva on the stages. That is, I am sorry to say, is completely deluded. It is not even conventionally deluded, it is fully deluded. You cannot possibly know this. You can only believe this. It maybe a useful belief for you. However, insisting that your subjective beliefs are objective facts is sad, and possibly harmful to others.

You don’t seem to understand the parameters of sexual misconduct.

There are four categories of sexual misconduct when defined from the point of view of the individual: upasaka, upavasa, shramanera, and bhikshu. Eight, when multiplied by gender.

For the latter three, sexual misconduct is any sexual conduct, including masturbation, for the duration the vow is maintained. In the case of the upavasa, the fast day vow,  only 24 hours. 

Otherwise, for the upasaka, sexual misconduct is defined in terms of partner, place, time, and orifice. A wrong partner is another’s spouse, partner, or fiancé, a minor, someone under guardianship, or a close relative. Wrong place means in public, a shrine or temple. Wrong Time means daytime. Wrong Orifice means oral or anal. That’s it, this is all described in chapter four of the Abhidharmakoshabhasyam of Vasubandhu, which is definitive on this subject for Sarvastivadin upasakas like myself.

One is not required to observe the vow of refraining from intoxication and sexual misconduct (the latter depends on the former for upasakas) if one decides one does not wish to hold all five vows. One can be a three vow holder, observing only the restraints from killing, stealing, and lying. 

Of course, in Vajrayana, it goes without saying that desire is employed in the path,

As Zhen Li points out, the Tibetan tradition only recognizes Indian source texts of verifiable provenance for such issues.

The one possible, and likely reading of this was that such tropes were subversive, as were a Buddhist claims that our version of fire pumas were more effective than the Vedic tradition, etc.

No longer were only people who were Kshatriyas by birth eligible to be anointed as cakravartins…now, everyone was. 

Other readings might hold that much as the liberal movement in Mid-19th century continental Europe pushed for political power, the mercantile class in ancient India, the main patrons of Buddhism, liberalized their own influence by sponsoring the very public rituals that characterized much of early Esoteric Buddhism, 

And prior to that, the obvious clash between Kshatriyas and Brahmins is quite evident in Pali literatures and so on, thus, also subversive.

It is unambiguous that Buddhism denies any form of a prime mover, first cause, or ex nihilo creation by a supreme being. Thus alone caused theists in every tradition that have encountered Buddhism to see it as atheist, nastika. 

As far as the political ramifications of theism go, it is irrefutable that every distinctly monotheist tradition has been imperialistic and oppressive by nature. Not all theistic traditions are necessarily monotheistic. However, since theistic traditions just reflect human absolute monarchies, even the tolerant theistic religions are anti-democratic  and despotic by nature.

Oh, that depends on the narrative you want to follow, really. If it pleases you to think the Buddha achieved Buddhahood a gazillion eons ago, that's fine, and I agree, being a Mahāyāni, but the whole point of the Jatakas and everything up to his demonstration of the twelve deeds was to demonstrate how a bodhisattva practiced the path, soup to nuts, and one cannot take birth as an animal if one has reached the patience of the path of seeing. So, even if he was "emanating" as the Hare King, it was to indicate how bodhisattvas below the path of seeing are to conduct themselves. 

The bodhisattva path is arduous, deliberately so. It involves helping sentient beings right from the beginning through the six perfections. 

One of the things you seem to forget is that bodhisattvas on the impure stages forget their realization during death, rebirth, and conception, and have to take rebirth again and again as ordinary bodhisattvas until they meet the path again. So what, are you claiming that you should only help sentient beings when you have reattained the path of seeing, that could be thousands of years from now. 

And I not talking about attending political rallies. I am talking about being a nurse, doctor, etc., all the right livelihoods that we ought to follow as Buddhist practitioners. I am not talking about being a political activist. I am talking about being an ordinary human being motivated by bodhicitta. 

BTW, Trungpa's teacher, Khenpo Gangshar, went around rousting people out of retreat telling them to get off their asses and go help people, whether they were realized or not. He is Trangu Rinpoches teacher. He was also reckoned to be a great dzogchen lineage master. So you see, not all Lineage Masters have the exact same idea.

One can only break bodhisattva vows by abandoning aspirational bodhicitta. Even if you break all of the other ones, if you never abandon to root of bodhicitta, you have not broken them completely.

There is also the fact that in kriya tantra people practice by addressing the deity as external, like Tāra, for example, for common siddhis; a kind of practice that is enjoyed by brahmins, which also depends heavily on ritual purity and so on. So, because Vajrayāna is a path of skillful means, it employs people's theistic tendencies. But this vanishes in carya tantra, where the deity is understood as a symbol of the nature of the mind and one visualizes oneself as the deity. By the time we get to HYT, this is all completely abandoned, since now we are to understand, at the time of the result, that all phenomena we experience—aggregates, sense bases, and sense elements—are the display of our own gnosis.

There is no need to reform Vajrayāna. If teachers simply followed their mahāyāna vows, there would be no problems.  There are no Vajrayāna vows which force one to engage in unconventional behavior. Vratacaryā, brtul shugs spyod pa, literally "the practice of strict observance"  should only be engaged in when one has arrived at the secret mantra path of application, and it is fairly well specified in tantras. Yes, there are recommendations that when one's guru should behave a little strangely, one should give it a pass. Unfortunately, naive people in the West seem to feel that "strange behavior" extends to conduct which is clearly criminal.

If maturity requires lionizing animal torture, pedophilia, knowingly infecting students with HIV, dosing people with hallucinogens without their consent, sexual harassment of nuns, forced labor of juveniles, etc., etc., you can keep it. 

Also, the idea that these kinds of behaviors would have been tolerated by the Buddhist community in ancient india and Tibet is ludicrous at best. 

There is a very good reason why Lha Lama Yeshe Ö composed Differentiating Dharma from Nondharma where he criticized mistaken interpretations of the practices of union and liberation, as well as other erroneous practices. Then of course, we have the example of Sakya Pandita, who criticized many mistaken practices that spread amongst Tibetans. I am sure he would have been absolutely critical of Trungpa. 

You invoke Virupa as an example of unconventional behavior, since indeed after practicing for decades, and meeting the nirmaṇakāya, Nairatmya, and receiving the Hevajra Tantra from her, eventually he was hounded out of his monastery, exiting by walking over the lotus pool on lotus leaves, causing the monastery to realize they had accidentally expelled a mahāsiddha from the bhikṣu sangha, someone who had actually been their chief upādhyāya. When we examine Virupa's life, however, we do not find that he harmed anyone, other than maybe giving a few people heat stroke and flooding a few homes. Quite the opposite, in fact—he put an end to Shaivaite animal sacrifices in many places in South India, and made the people promise to only present Shiva with offerings of vegetarian food and fruit. Virupa derided "unconventional behavior" in his dohas, as did Saraha. 

The great translator, Rinchen Zangpo, was able to cause Sangye Kargyal to fall to the ground with a mere glance-- the latter having a habit of teaching while he was levitating. 

Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen, whom history records only demonstrated the secret mantra path of application, not even a mahāsiddha, technically speaking, was able levitate his vajra and bell during his sadhana according to the brief accounts of his life.  

Now, I see no evidence at all that Trungpa was such a mahāsiddha. I observe a man, deeply flawed, who had the institutional backing of Karma Kagyu school, for whom he was an "earner," who also was charismatic, intelligent, likable, and very self-destructive, as many people with serious narcissistic personality disorders often are. He garnered the admiration of many when he was a unicorn, a Tibetan with a smattering of a western education, who spoke English fairly well, though not as well as one would be believe from his very heavily-edited books. He ran his students deeply into debt to pay for the 16th Karmapa's trip, debts that were only finally paid off after his death. Sexual harassment of women in his centers by meditation instructors was endemic from the beginning, as was alcoholism, etc. The problems in his centers were quite enormous. Turnover was very high, membership was iffy at best. Financial problems were very prominent in Vajradhātu by the early 1980's for reasons that are easy to understand. And now, people are beginning to talk, like the Steinbecks, who report that in Boulder, Trungpa's cocaine habit was $40,000 per annum, about to a gram to two grams a day in 1977 prices. 

People keep on talking about how this is all "Western" moralizing. But that, of course, is nonsense. Tibetans would have never put up with this business for a second. Tibetans were not rubes. In general, Tibetans themselves were quite allergic to people who expressed unconventional behavior. Tibetans are quite prudish and conventional as a rule. 

The reality is that since the time of Sakya Pandita and now, there has been a lot of malpractice in Tibetan Buddhism. There is a lot of malpractice in Tibetan lineages as they have spread to the West. It is not healthy to spend our time lionizing these modern "mahāsiddhas" whose main siddhi seems to have been fund raising from Westerners and Chinese people, who, when exposed to scrutiny, are revealed to be deeply flawed human beings. Justifying their behavior through legends of mahāsiddhas of the past is naive at best and nonvirtuous at worst.

It’s quite easy to know, actually. The Madhyamaka tradition does not require the possession of prātimokṣa vows before taking the bodhisattva vow, since they are bestowed during the rite itself. They are not bestowed during the Yogacara rite, and need to be bestowed beforehand. The Indian manuals for these are to be found in the Tenjur.

No, I am questioning your distinction between "practice" and and the bodhisattva conduct of the six perfections. Bodhisattvas have the courage to remain in samsara for a long time, eons, aiding sentient beings, going through the paths and stages slowly, life after life. Even if one is a practitioner of secret mantra, one needs to have this courage. 

Bodhisattvas can practice the six perfections through their engagement in benefitting sentient beings through their political advocacy for universal health care, etc., things Nāgārjuna recommended in the Garland of Gems. 

You seem to have this idea that being involved with politics is all about theories. In reality, it is all about outcomes: clean air, clean water, clean environment, preventing habitat loss, equal rights, peace, etc. Working for these things is bodhisattva activity. For example, ChNN's ASIA is a political organization. ChNN was never afraid to work in the political world. We cannot do very much on our own about these things, but we can help where we can, and that is also a part of our practice. 

The other thing you neglect about your Lineage Masters is that they all lived in monarchies, not democracies. In absolute monarchies, of the kind that most pre-modern people lived under, to be involved in political life was to be involved in either working with or working against factions in a court. Their concept of politics is completely different than ours. There was no democracy. But democracy demands educated participation from those who benefit from it. The Buddha himself advocated citizen engagement in their country. He expected people to support their rulers, follow the laws, and so on. Well, we don't have kings anymore. We have Constitutions, which are better than kings, in every possible way. What I am saying is that there is no contradiction between the conduct of a bodhisattva and political engagement in a democracy, like voting, etc.

Mostly, such claims are rubbish, but if someone could do so, it would be along the lines of gaining control over the four elements through samadhi, like the arhat who self-immolated by having gained control over fire by meditating on fire kacina. 

Such miraculous abilities are widely reported in traditional literature of all cultures, but never reproduced in front of witnesses. 

I can report however that the weather was always terrible around ChNN. He was also remarkably successful in casinos too. However he once quipped to me when shown a picture of one of these miracles of a modern lama who stakes his reputation on such miracles, “get me some concrete and I can do that too.” So you see, my skepticism has some basis.

The word “sham” comes from “shaman.”

As for Ngakpa Rinpoche, his weather making abilities were inherited, and involved controlling nagas. He was quite good at this, which is why he was hired.

I just know that confirmation bias is very strong, and has cognitive rewards. 

I have no incentive to give people’s miracle stories credence at all. If I won’t extend this credulity to Christians and Hindus, why would I extend it to Buddhists? 

It is said the Buddha was able to levitate, and by the same token the Buddha also explained to us that such abilities were not indications of awakening.

The true miracle of Dharma is bodhicitta, because it is so rare.

You’ve clearly drunk the koolaid, which is sad, because this means that people will continue with this strange imagination that it is necessary for a teacher to be a sociopath, and given the number of animals he actually tortured, to signal their realization. 

Now, ChNN was an actual genius and polymath. 

Most of Trungpa’s success was a function of his corporate support from the Karma Kagyus and ability to raise money (a lot if it from a cocaine dealer). But he was f*cked. He sexually assaulted a women in public in front of 300 students, with his vajra guards looking on, reaching up under her dress and fondling her vagina. True story, told to me by an eyewitness, the guard who was present. 

Frankly I tire of hearing how outrageous and enlightened trungpa was. He was a sociopath with no empathy. The notion he was what the West, meaning America, needed at the time is utter bollocks. Western Buddhists lionize Trungpa to the detriment of Buddhism as a whole. 

It’s all coming out now, all the terrible stories, and frankly, anyone who thinks the carnage and destruction trungpa left in his wake is a sign of awakened conduct just has not properly studied the Dharma. It’s really a sad episode in the history Buddhism. Nothing to lionize and uphold as an example.

What happens, when we begin to practice dharma, is that we begin to notice suffering in ways we never did before. But the idea that virtuous practice can cause negative karma to ripen is a deeply mistaken idea. That negative karma is going to ripen when the causes and conditions for its ripening are present, and not before. Only a buddha has the omniscience to determine what causes and conditions lead to the ripening of karma for this and that person. For example, the point of Vajrasattva and other methods in Vajrayana is to eliminate traces of karma before they meet conditions for ripening.

We have to use logic. Small karmas result in huge ripening. Small sufferings are not going to remove huge karmas. 

We accumulate merit because that is good karma. We do so to keep ourselves of the realms of rebirth where negative karmas will ripen fully. 

If people really want to understand how this works, they need to study chapter 4 of the Koshabhasyam. For example, if one takes rebirth in the form realm, karma generated in the desire realm cannot ripen there. So it is delayed. Karma can only ripen in the realm in which it was created.

There are rules, but people do not take the time to learn them. They just run after So and so RInpoche, thinking he is enlightened, and when they find out Rinpoche is a womanizer and a drunk, they really have no one to blame but themselves for not examining them more closely. In cases where there is criminal conduct, that is a matter for the authorities. That's been my position all along. 

What's much worse, actually, is teachers who have no qualities or credentials to give empowerments, etc., who do so anyway, people who receive ocean promotions, etc. 

Generally, if people are worried about such issues, they should make sure their teacher is fully ordained monk or nun who keeps their vows scrupulously. But people like lay teachers because they hang out, have a beer, eat a burger, chat, etc.

What one labels oneself is irrelevant. Buddhism negates two fundamental tenets of theism: 1. uncaused creation of the universe and its inhabitants by a supreme being. 2. Salvation dependent on a relationship with said supreme being. In other words, no god created you, and Jesus/Allah, etc. are not going to save you. 

If you ask any theist, they will tell you you are an atheist for denying creation and salvation. They won't give a fig about your acceptance of rebirth, worldly devas in the deva realms, and so on. To them, you are a godless atheist. And they are right.

The actual amount that causes a bhikṣu defeat, according to Kongtrul, is the value of a bushel of barley, about $4.75 in today's market. So, if a bhikṣu scams a White Chocolate Mocha	Venti at $4.75 they are defeated. And, if they downloaded a movie illegally, valued at a 5.99 rental, they would be defeated as well. 

But this does not apply to lay people, for obvious reason, which when spelled out, there is no such thing as a defeat for an upāsaka and two, upāsakas are permitted to carry money and so on, hence such a cap for a defeat is irrelevant and taking anything that is not given is breach of one's upāsaka vow. That's my point.

Title: Re: The Myth of Progress
Content:
One should rely on a doctrine taught by the Buddhas, realized by mahasiddhas, commented upon by panditas, and translated by the lotsawas. That's it. All of Thaye's other remarks are just so much conservative whinging that have nothing to with Buddhadharma. I mean, what are we to make of Aśoka murdering 18,000 Jains over a satirical cartoon? Continue to revere him as the ideal Dharmarāja? Come on. 

This, "The rejection of progress as incompatible with the very nature of dharma...," is a ridiculous assertion, as ridiculous as those people whom Salya Pandita chided for rejecting medicine because some people imagine, foolishly, that accepting medicine to cure illness means one has no faith in Dharma. 

He directly contradicts himself in the very next passage:

The Mahayana notion of universal enlightenment should not, however, be misunderstood as a claim that progress toward Buddhahood is somehow structured into the very nature of the world, and that we are always reaching ever closer to it. Instead, its sense is that all beings will obtain enlightenment because they are primordially pervaded by buddhanature, the true nature of reality itself.

If the true nature of reality is buddhanature (it isn't, only sentient beings have buddhanature, not rocks and trees) then progress towards buddhahood is structured into the nature of the world. 


This is also poorly written, "Buddhism offers a contrary idea of history. It teaches us that history, as the manifestation of samsara, is essentially cyclical in nature." Buddhism does not teach anything at all about history. History is a modern, empirically-based discipline, which did not exist in the time of the Buddha. At best, during the time of the Buddha, there was only "Itihasa," that is, just so stories. 

The funny thing, he could be criticizing the right wing author, Francis Fukuyama here, "The notion of inevitable progress has been so tenacious that today’s dominant liberal and Marxist ideologies, which have in one way or another sought to replace Christianity, have swallowed its historical narrative without demur. They have merely recast it in terms of an inevitable social and intellectual progress culminating in the end of history itself."  Of course, Fukuyama retreated from his neoconservative ideals in the wake of the Iraq war:

https://www.spiegel.de/international/in ... 07315.html

Finally he says, in contradiction to his whole spiel, "The task before us in the 21st century is not to alter the timeless message of the Buddha, but, once we have received it fully (a process which may well have some way to go!), to present it in the language and organizational forms most appropriate for the contemporary situation."

This happens organically anyway. There is no need to contrive this, especially by going off like some Buddhist William F. Buckley Jr. on the supposed tragedies of "liberalism." What people have to do is learn Tibetan, receive the teachings, do the retreats, and pass on the teachings. Personal politics has very little to do with this process. But when people begin citing people like Sapan, who was a strict formalist when it came discerning which teachings were of valid provenance as opposed to Tibetan innovations, they had better make sure they are not hoisting themselves on their own petards.

No, since he cites Padmasambhava in the end.

Modern historical method is not false, it is, as much as possible, empirical and evidence-based. It is limited in so far as the evidence that can be mustered is limited. 

Assertions by the ancients that cannot be empirically verified or disproven are left aside as unproven— not false, not true, just unverified. Things like the geocentrism, etc., which are demonstrably false, given the evidence, of course ought to be left in the dustbin of mistaken notions. Axial mountain myths are understandable and inspiring, but in the end they are just myths. 

Also ancient scholars weren't dummies. For example, Sakya Pandita shows, based on textual sources, namely the Mahābharata, that identifying Kailash as Mt. Meru is impossible. Ancient scholars too had their empirical standards of evidence, especially ancient Buddhist scholars. The thing about empirical knowledge is that it changes with the evidence, as it should.  

When one is writing history, one must adhere to what can be empirically shown with evidence. Otherwise, it is not history at all. It is just opinion and conjecture. The very real inability to distinguish between opinion and conjecture on the one hand, and evidence on the other, is one of the great failings of the modern educational system, which has largely abandoned rationality in favor of technology. Some of the stupidest, most gullible people I have ever met are really good at math, engineering, and applied science. But when it comes to anything else, dumb as rocks.

Education also has great deal to do with this—but not STEM education, rather humanities education— because people study things like literature, anthropology, philosophy, etc., tend to be more flexible thinkers. People educated in STEM programs are as likely to tack right as left, because STEM programs do not teach humanities. The great sadness I feel in the American educational system is the lack of comprehensive humanities education in grade 1-12 education. So many of our kids arrive in college barely able to read and write. They are good at filling in circles with graphite pencils though.

The Buddhist world view is only similar in that we have an expanded notion of what kinds of possibilities there are for sentient beings to take birth as.

Title: Re: Let's talk about common misconceptions of Buddhism
Content:
Yeah, we really are not. Polytheism attributes control of the world through various functions of external deities. We certainly give lip service to such concepts, but again, the Buddhist thought about such beings is much like that of Epicurean thought:


Lucretius presents Epicurus’ chief achievement as the defeat of religio. Although this Latin word is correctly translated into English as ‘religion’, its literal meaning is ‘binding down’, and it therefore serves Lucretius as a term, not for all attitudes of reverence towards the divine, but for those which cow people’s spirits, rather than, as he thinks such attitudes should, elevate them to a joyful state of tranquility.

......

Either way, what is not in doubt is that the gods’ role as moral ideals is paramount in the Epicurean system. And this is the function Lucretius too gives them, especially in the proems to books 1, 3, 5 and 6. The gods live a supremely tranquil life, never disquieted by either favour or anger towards us. By contemplating them as they truly are we can aspire to achieve that same blissful state within the confines of a human lifespan. But Lucretius adds another dimension to this theology: What Lucretius effectively asserts is that, on a Euhemeristic ranking, Epicurus is a far greater god than Ceres or Bacchus, held to have originally been the institutors of, respectively, agriculture and wine, and also a far greater god than the divinized Hercules. For Hercules rid the world merely of literal monsters like the Hydra, but it’s not as if there aren’t plenty of wild beasts left in the world to terrorize us today. Epicurus on the other hand has offered us real and permanent salvation from monsters, namely those truly frightful monsters that haunt our souls, such as insatiable desires, fears, and arrogance.

.....

Lucretius was both admired and imitated by writers of the early Roman empire, while in the eyes of Latin patristic authors like Lactantius he came to serve as the leading spokesman of the godless Epicurean philosophy. His poem subsequently survived in two outstanding 9th-century manuscripts (known as O and Q), which following the poem’s rediscovery by the papal secretary Poggio Bracciolini in 1417 (for this fascinating story see Greenblatt 2011) became the basis of the Renaissance editions. It was through Lucretius, along with the Latin translation of Diogenes Laertius’ Life of Epicurus, that Epicurean ideas entered the main philosophical (especially ethical) debates of the age. However, despite his extensive impact in literary and philosophical circles—he is, for example, among the writers most assiduously cited by Montaigne—Lucretius struggled for two centuries to shake off the pejorative label of ‘atheist’. 



https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lucretius


The impact of the Epicurean thought on the Enlightenment is much neglected.

As I have often mentioned, if I were to select a western philosophy to emulate, it would be that of Epicurus and Lucretius.

Here is another tidbit:

Epicurus rejected the conventional Greek view of the gods as anthropomorphic beings who walked the earth like ordinary people, fathered illegitimate offspring with mortals, and pursued personal feuds.[111] Instead, he taught that the gods are morally perfect, but detached and immobile beings who live in the remote regions of interstellar space.[112] In line with these teachings, Epicurus adamantly rejected the idea that deities were involved in human affairs in any way.[110][113] Epicurus maintained that the gods are so utterly perfect and removed from the world that they are incapable of listening to prayers or supplications or doing virtually anything aside from contemplating their own perfections.[112] In his Letter to Herodotus, he specifically denies that the gods have any control over natural phenomena, arguing that this would contradict their fundamental nature, which is perfect, because any kind of worldly involvement would tarnish their perfection.[113] He further warned that believing that the gods control natural phenomena would only mislead people into believing the superstitious view that the gods punish humans for wrongdoing, which only instills fear and prevents people from attaining ataraxia.[113]

Umm, no, I identified a couple of westerners philosophers, who I think bolster my point quite well. 

The problem here is that you seem to believe that being an atheist entails adhering to logical positivism. 

 It fact, the essence of atheism is denying supernatural causation to explain natural phenomena. Like modern atheists we reject first cause, prime movers, and creators. Like modern atheists, we assert ethics should be grounded in rationality, rather than divine ordinances. As Candrakirti pointed out, the only difference between us and materialists is that we accept karma and rebirth. Otherwise, our points of view are more similar than they are different.

Yes, it is a little difficult. 

Let's start the last item, obviously money run through nonprofits has to be transparent by law. Personal gifts, dana, is private, not subject to taxation, etc., nor should it be. 

Moving on the first item, there is no actual reason it is necessarily wrong for teachers to sleep with students, as long as it is consensual. There are some people who will argue that it can never be consensual. I don't buy that argument.

As for the second item, these are legal terms. If someone assaults someone this is either a misdemeanor or a felony, depending. If a student, for example, receives a blow from a teacher, and declines to press charges, that will generally be the end of it and should be the end of it. If they are beaten to a pulp, that is a different matter. Sexual assault is more serious, because that is always a crime. You neglected to mention verbal assault, BTW.

For example, in America, in the 1960's, it was permissible for elementary school teachers to slap students. I got slapped once, in second grade. Parents generally felt this was ok. By the 1980's, this was no longer ok. These things are never so cut and dry as people want to make them. 

In some states in the US, it is illegal for licensed minister to sleep with a parishioner.  In most, it is not. At this point, very few Buddhist teachers are licensed members of the clergy. Generally, it is because such licensure depends on some kind of ordination and endorsement by a religious body which shows the member is in good standing, etc., and the vast majority of Buddhist teachers are not ordained and do not belong to these kinds of organized religious groups. So, it is really not as simple as you want it to be, with your reductionist set of guidelines. Many Tibetan male lay teachers active today pursue relationships among their students, if they are not married (and sometimes, even if they are, sometimes even if they are ordained). I could give you a list but in the interest of people's privacy, I am not going to. Frankly, what people do in their private lives is none of our business, as long as it is not criminal. I know a lot of people who are disappointed that Sogyal did not live long enough to be taken to court again. People point to the San Francisco Zen Center as a place which gives a good road map, but Richard Baker never stopped teaching, not ever. People still excuse Seungsahn's behavior, though, frankly, again, what people do on their own time is their own business. His Kwan Um centers are widespread in America, they are all over the place. It's such old news though, I think most new students have no idea. Maybe they are entrance counseled about it, I don't know. NKT, still going strong, after myriad sex and ethics scandals. Shambhala will continue. Diamond Mt. shut down, but Michael Roach is still out there, even being implicated in the death of one of his closest students did not stop him. 

So, the only course is to make sure you examine the teacher.

Yes, agreed. Good thing we don't practice history, though. The Mahāyanīs had a transcendent view of the Buddha as a person. But we also do not practice text criticism. 

But I do understand your point. If we are going to talk about empirical history, we have to be honest about things like the repurposing of legendary Indian persons like  Brahmin Vararuci (Bramze mchog sred), considered on of the most highly educated panditas in India, into the manifestation of Padmasambhava called  Loden Chogse (blo ldan mchog sred) or Brilliant Vararuci, etc. 

If we are going to go by tradition, then these are two different persons.

Well, for starters, he did not punch her very hard, it was a kind of a running joke between them, nevertheless he was mad. Second, he and she hugged and giggled immediately after the famous punch. And there is the third point, which is that the nun in question completely disagreed with how this was covered by the media, is still a loyal student of Sogyal, and refused to press charges of assault. But of course her point of view is brushed off as being a mere cult member cluelessness and blind devotion. 

Now, let me clarify, Sogyal did have a penchant for hitting his students with his famous backscratcher. He hit someone I know in the head with it quite solidly once. My friend claims that this blow allowed him to understand the nature of the mind. It cut right through all his bullshit. I believe him, because this person has a very good understanding of Dzogchen teachings. I am pretty confident that Sogyal had a very good understanding of Dzogchen teachings as well. Having a good understanding of Dzogchen teachings does not necessarily make one a nice person to be around. 

Now, I myself would be prefer to humiliated in front of 300 people by being yelled on a hot mic for being a young, arrogant scholar (as happened with Chogyal Namkhai Norbu in 1992, which by the way sealed the deal for me about ChNN), some people get it by being hit in public, others by being hit with sandals, backscratchers, etc. I am not saying that we have to stay with gurus who we feel are abusive or appear abusive. I am saying we need to be careful about how we judge the interactions of other people with their teachers. The people who wrote the letter, and the people who have come forward about their experience of Sogyal, felt abused. Others, experiencing just the same conduct at the same time, did not, and defended their teacher. I cannot condemn either side for the way they behaved. 

In the end, it is caveat emptor, on the part of both the teacher and the student. The teacher has to examine the student well. The student has to examine the teacher well. It is clear that many Rigpa students did not examine the teacher well; it is equally clear the teacher did not examine the students well. So, in the end, they both suffered. While I would not blame his ex-students, it is pretty clear to me that Sogyal died in a state of profound sadness, and died earlier than he would have otherwise as a result of the whole thing. And people cannot give it up, still they incessantly criticize Sogyal as the Tibetan Guru Bogeyman, honestly, there are worse teachers out there, in the past and also still active, I am quite sure. 

Many Asian teaches, from a Western point of view, have very poor boundaries. It's ok to have boundaries, but one should understand that in the traditional guru disciple relationship in Vajrayāna Buddhism, those boundaries can be sorely tested. Most of the problem these days arises from this kind of misunderstanding. Some of it is cultural. In old Tibet, if a renowned guru wanted to sleep with someone, it was regarded as an honor, bringing fortune to everyone, for obvious reasons which are not spiritual at all and totally patriarchal and sexist. Here, if a guru wants to sleep with someone, he or she is immediately a creep, a pervert, a libertine, a scoundrel, because we have a different set of values derived from how we view the clerical trade in West, and what kind of boundaries should be observed. If one is priest, celibacy; if one is minister, one should be in a strictly monogamous union. 

In the end, we need to be careful about who we take as our teachers, just as they need to be careful about who they choose as students.

The Jonangpas are Buddhist because they go for refuge to the three jewels and engage in Buddhist training. 

They are “realists, vastuvadins” because they are a subspecies of Yogacara attempts to interpret Nagarjuna through the treatises of Maitreya. Their nearest Indian exponent is Ratnakarashanti, who asserts the ultimacy of gnosis, etc.

There are three realist Buddhist tenet systems: Sarvastivada, and other shravakayana schools, Sautrantikas, and Yogacara. But here Buddhist realism means something different than the assertion of universals as real, like the Nyaya school, etc. it means asserting that disparate particulars are real or ultimate.

No, the Hindu concept of reincarnation is much stranger, much more like Pythagorean metempsychosis than the Buddhist understanding of dependent origination and karma. It’s pretty strange. Also different Hindu schools have different ideas about the specifics but they all, in the end, assert a permanent, ultimate  entity, and we do not.

Everyone mocks each other’s nonfalsifiable beliefs, movement atheists have many nonfalsifiable beliefs also. But that’s not the point, Buddhists offer natural mechanisms which explain all of theirs, and none of them involve relying any external force. These system, Trika, Advaita, no need to mention Samkhya, etc., are all  realist schools. Thus they are limited because they do not understand dependent origination. 

Among western schools, Buddhism most closely resembles Epicureanism, then after that, Hume. Of course, we tear them apart too, but they are the closest.

I forgot to mention it, Epicurus is the father of modern, Western atheism.

It is not an attempt. Western Buddhists tend to be left-wing progressives, except in Eastern Europe, where they are tend to lean right, because of their experience with Stalinism. The first time I met a Republican Buddhist I was honestly very shocked. I personally do not see how you can square right wing politics with bodhicitta. Why do you think we were so hard on you about vaccinations? You are going to be very unhappy in the Dharma in America if you can't deal with progressives.

Unsurprisingly, I am a left-wing progressive. I feel much more at ease in the company of atheists than I do in the company of Christians. I least I know the former are pro-democratic. In this I stand in good company with men like Ethan Allen, Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, and other notable atheists of the American revolution. 

Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc are anti-democratic by nature, whereas Buddhism is not. It probably has to do with the Platonic and Neo-platonic origins of their philosophy and theology. Qabala, for example, is just reheated neoplatonism. 

It is also not surprising in the least that Buddhists, in ancient India were lumped together with the carvakas by other schools, since we reject śruti, varna, etc, basically everything in the "Laws of Manu." The only difference between us and materialists, even today, is that we accept rebirth and karma, they do not.

As I mentioned before, Buddhism in all it forms is a kind of nominalism; we reject that pādārthas aka universals are real. The acceptance of the real existence of universals is a characteristic of right wing philosophy everywhere.

I think Asanga's point is incorrect, and it may not be directed at Nāgārjuna directly.

In CW's defense, I know the Gayatri Mantra, and I never studied the Vedas. 

However, the reason I say he knew Sanskrit is that he regular chatted with Brahmins in Sanskit, and twitted them on their arrogance toward the speech of low caste bhiḳsus, causing him to declare his teachings should be taught in local vernacular. Hence my insistence that serious sadhana practice should be done in one's own language.

Yes, in someone's samadhi, there are no limitations to what may appear, depending on the depth of that samadhi. But there are definitely some physical limitations from the point of view of view of ordinary conventional perception. Since that is the base line for communicating with people, in general, we should confine ourselves to that and not expect people to believe in miracles.

In the Pali canon, a figure named Vajrapāṇi is described as a yakṣa:

Now at that time the yakkha Thunderbolt-bearer, taking his iron thunderbolt which was aglow, ablaze, on fire, came to stand above the ground over Saccaka, the son of Jains, and said: “If this Saccaka, the son of Jains, does not answer when he is asked a legitimate question up to the third time by the Lord, verily I will make his skull split into seven pieces.” 

https://legacy.suttacentral.net/en/mn35

Here we see Vajrapāṇi in his early role as dharmapāla. He is not, as some people erroneously claim, a form of Indra. Indra is never a yakṣa. 

There is a continuity with this identification of Vajrapāṇi in lower tantras as Guhypati, lord of secrets,  meaning lord of the Guhyakas, a class of Yakṣas who live in the north. In Kriya tantra, for example, one notes that only Vajra family deities require secrecy in their practice. 

Also in the tantras, Vajrapāṇi, in his form known as Bhūtaḍāmara, is also considered the general of the dharmapālas, as he was able to successfully subdue Yakṣa Mahākāla where Hayagriva was unable to do so (which may be throwing shade on Hayagriva as an important Vedic deity, a preserver of the Vedas), in the Buddhist version of the destruction of Tripura, which resulted from an epic class struggle between the asuras and devas.

As I mentioned, sadhana recitation, for beginners, is a form of shamatha.  This is how it is presented by mahasiddha Padmavajra. 

Yes, it’s a recipe, which has stages, etc., as well as precise bases of purification, purifiers, and results of purification.  For serious personal practice, a beginner should seek to do the middle length or long version of a sadhana. Sadhanas are not just “how fast can I get to the mantra”. Actually, mantra recitation is a post-equipoise practice, which generally comes AFTER the two stages, though thus not universal. The various stages in a sadhana, as mentioned above, have various specific functions related to purifying traces of the past life, conception, gestation, birth, and so on. They also epitomize the attainment of buddhahood in a single lifetime, from the initial thought of awakening to nonabiding nirvana, which normally takes three uncountable eons to achieve. So, there are important reasons to both understand the words and not rely on shorter sadhanas, as well as carefully reciting the words of the text so they trigger the appropriate visualization-clearly, quickly, and with focus. Short sadhanas do not have all these features, and are just for commitment maintenance, not liberation.

No. Vajrayana is an understanding of a kind of profound dependent origination which also requires no belief in anything. For that matter neither does rebirth, karma, etc. All of these are automatically validated when dependent origination is properly understood. So if you want to understand all these, understand dependent origination. It’s the Buddha’s most subtle teaching, and explicating it, with varying degrees of success is whole point of Abhidharma, Yogacara, Madhyamaka, and Vajrayana.

These four should be understood in ascending order.

Where to begin. If you don’t know what the aggregates are, you do not understand what you are from a Buddhist point of view. At base you are mind/matter. 

One of your aggregates is material, made of the five material sense organs and five material senses objects. It’s called the material aggregate. 

The other four aggregates are consciousness and the mental factors. 

The aggregates of mental factors are three: sensation, perception, and formations. Sensation is the mental factor of the sensations of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness and indifference. Perception is the mental factor that coordinates discernment of one object from another. There are 51 mental factors in the aggregate of formations. That list can be sought elsewhere. 

Consciousness, the knower, is the mental subject perceiving all this. That subject lacks all true identity, any identity it possesses is a mere, designated identity imputed on a false conceptual construct, I-am, which has no lore existence than an illusion. It’s present moment of cognition is nonconceptual, the handling of that immediate perception by mental factors is conceptual, both in terms of memory consciousness and speculative consciousness.

That’s it. That’s all you are. Five aggregates.
