The eight dhyānas are paths of rebirth. The only reason the Buddha meditated on them was to remove traces connected with rebirth in these lokas.

Otherwise, as I mentioned, and as Astus affirms, the first bhumi requires only one-pointedness, non-distraction, on the object of contemplation, four-fold emptiness. Upon its attainment, one can manifest one hundred bodies, visit one hundred buddhafields and so on:

“If he wishes to, he can apply himself in such a way that in just one instant, in one moment, he can give up his entire family, wife, and possessions and be ordained in the Tathāgata’s teaching. Having been ordained, in just one instant he will attain and rest in a hundred samādhis, see a hundred buddhas and know their blessings, cause a hundred worlds to shake, go to a hundred buddha realms, [F.185.b] illuminate a hundred worlds, ripen a hundred beings, remain for a hundred eons, enter a hundred previous eons and a hundred future eons, open a hundred Dharma doors, manifest a hundred bodies, and manifest each body having a retinue of a hundred bodhisattvas.

He does make some minor errors hear and there—-who doesn’t?—-but the point is not the accuracy of his translations, but his review of a selection of various commentaries composed by Tibetans on the subject. You will see there, invariable, they are univocal about the need for four causes to take birth in Sukhavati. I’ve consulted these to make sure he’s got it right, and some commentaries he hasn’t presented, such as the Sakya commentary mentioned, for review. The Tibetan Buddhist approach is pretty well summarized by Weihan above.

Samadhi is a natural mental factor of one pointedness. People with no experience, who like to follow books like recipe guides, say such things as "first dhyāna is absolutely mandatory for the path of seeing." But then you have to ask them if they have discovered the path of seeing. If they say no, then obviously they are just going to the basis of what they have heard or read in a book. If they say yes, there are other tests you can apply.

In Mahāyāna, the samadhi part is not perfected until the fifth bhumi. There is no requirement for the first dhyāna to realize the first bhumi. The first bhumi merely requires realization of śunyatā. That can come about as a result of the union of śamatha and vipaśyāna, or it can be arrived at merely through vipaśyāna. It depends on the person. All that is really necessary is that aspiring bodhisattva can focus on their analysis on the emptiness of objects without being distracted, but is certainly does not mean that they have to first perfect all four or five factors of the first dhyāna. It won't harm them if they do, but it is not required.

You should examine Discerning the Middle from the Extremes, it presents a concise summary of the five paths and how they are realized in Mahāyāna. Madhyamaka texts do not discuss this so much, at least, not early ones.

The Soto School is the largest single Buddhist institution in Japan, with 14,000 temples. There are are larger denominations—pure land is the largest, with 8 million followers, but it is split into ten different  bodies, with Nishi Honganji being the largest, with 10,000 temples.

Despite the popularity of Zen in Kamakura and Hōjō Tokiyori‘s support for it, Zen in Kamakura itself was still small potatoes, and confined to the literate elite. It was the “it” Buddhism of the day, since it was the latest Import from China. When Tokiyori ordained in 1256, Nichiren would had been 34. And had himself barely arrived in Kamakura.  It would be six years more before Nichiren forwarded his Risshō Ankoku Ron to Tokiyori, who had by then ordained and left the government in the hands of Hōjō Nagatoki. The person most instrumental in spreading Zen in the Kamakura era was Hōjō Tokimune. It was he who banished Nichiren to Sado Island. Tokimune’s teacher was the Chinese monk, Mugaku Sogen. However, Mugaku did not arrive until 1279.

The reason why your argument here is flawed is that there is a clear distinction to be made between natural gotra and “expanded gotra.” For example, all viable seeds have the potential to germinate (natural gotra), but without water, warmth, and soil, they won’t germinate (expanded gotra). It is just not inevitable that all sentient beings will develop the aspiration to attain buddhahood for the welfare of all sentient beings. As the old saying goes, one can lead a horse to water, but one can’t force it to drink. All sentient beings may be “buddhanatured”, but not all sentient will necessarily generate Mahayana  bodhicitta. Without bodhicitta, buddhahood is just not possible. This also why Madhyamikas like Candrakirti entertain the probability that there are some benighted sentient beings who will never attain buddhahood, despite having the potential to attain buddhahood, just as some seeds never germinate, even though they are viable.

Unlikely. Zen Buddhism, during Nichiren's life was fledgling. When Nichiren was 3, Dogen was 25, and Eisai, the master who brought Rinzai to Kakakura had been dead for 15 years. 

Anyway, it is pretty clear that the Zen that got Nichiren's back up was the Daruma school, but that had already been banned by 1194 becasue Eisai, recently returned from studying Chan in China, requested the Tendau school to shut Nonin down. 

Both Eisai and Dogen met with a lot of resistance from the Tendai school over their versions of Zen, with Dogen eventually fleeing Kyoto politics to the mountains outside present day Fukui City in western Japan in 1243, where he built Eiheiji. 

The Pure Land school was much more immediately popular than Zen during the 13th century. The hegemony of Zen in Japanese Buddhism took considerable time to develop.

What I quoted from is the so-called Large Sūtra, it is the passage immediately before this one above. The Sanskrit and Tibetan text certainly mentions these four requirementsfor those who see Amitabha before them in person. For whatever reason, in the Tibetan tradition, seeing Amitabha in a dream is not sufficient for immediate birth, only those of the first and second grade will do so. 

Because the second grade also generate (1) bodhicitta, (2) the altruistic thought to attain birth there, (3) much merit, and (4) direct their minds to Sukhavati, when they approach death, an emanation of Amitabha and his retinue appear to that person and as soon as they die, they will take birth in Sukhavati. 

No such stated guarantee is made for people who merely see Amitabha in dream. In its Sanskrit and Tibetan version there is no statement in the Long Sūtra that as soon as those person's die they will be born in Sukhavati. It merely says they will be born there without specifying a time frame. 

Thus, there is a difference in the textual tradition which underlies a difference in understanding the requirements for birth in Sukhavati. Thus, as I said, it is not so easy to take birth in Sukhavati from the Tibetan tradition's point of view. For this reason there is a sadhana practice of Amitabha with the mantra.

Generally, in the Tibetan tradition, we focus on the longevity-providing aspect of Amitabha, Amitayuḥ.

It is based on a passage from Ārya Amitābhavyūha Sūtra:

Ānanda, any sentient beings who repeatedly thinks of the aspects of that tathāgata, generates immeasurable quantities of roots of merit, totally dedicates themselves to generating the thought to awaken (bodhicitta), and offers supplications to be born in that world, when the time of death draws near will see before them the Tathāgatam Arhat, Samyaksambuddha Amitābha surrounded by many groups of bhikṣus.  Upon seeing Bhagāvan Amitābha, they will die with a mind of utter faith, and be born in that world, Sukhavati."

Karma Chakme's prayer is structured around these four points from the sūtra. His aspiration is a supplement  to the Sadhana practice of Amitabha found in the Sky Treasure (Nam chos) tradition, which is widely practiced in both Nyingma and Kagyu, but not really in Sakya or Geluk. 

There is a shorter aspiration, set down by Namcho Migyur Dorje:

I don't agree with your rendering of this part of the passage:

This states very clearly in Tibetan, "The gnosis of the tathāgata abides in the bodies of all those dharmabhāṇakas." 

It does not say the the gnosis of the tathāgata abides in the bodies of all sentient beings. This being so, I reject your argument.

Arhats, after they die, are basically formless realm beings, who because they have subtle traces, wind up taking birth again. They are among the "some buddhas" who err and re-enter samsara. It's not very shocking, since we already know that arhats can fall away from arhatship, according even to śrāvaka sources.

Basically, arhats have a subtle grasping to true existence because they do not realize four-fold signlessness. Since they have this subtle grasping to true existence, they continue to grasp a self. Because they continue to grasp a self, they accumulate action. And since they continue to accumulation action, they can continue to take birth, having been roused from nirodhasamāpatti. And because of this arhats, in order to realize buddhahood, must begin at the beginning of the Mahāyāna path of application where one reviews through hearing and reflection signlessness, etc.

In the Tibetan tradition this is understood to be an impossible aspiration, though meritorious. For example, the Buddha, as Shantideva points out, perfected generosity not because he could actually relieve the poverty of all sentient beings, but because he wished to—the merit of such aspirations exceeds the fact that they cannot possibly be achieved. And it goes without saying, Buddhas cannot liberate anyone. The proof of this is that there are still sentient beings. No Buddha with the capacity to liberate sentient beings would ever leave so many in samsara. One can only liberate oneself from this samsara. No Buddha or bodhisattva can do it for you. There is no choice but to practice a path taught by the Buddha, and without a precious human birth, that choice isn’t even available.

Even then, it’s not guaranteed, even from the point of view of the tradition of Karma Chakme. A commentary by Tujey Zhanphen Pel on Karma Chakme’s famous aspiration specifies four requirements for birth in Sukhavati: the support, the recollection of the merit field at the time of death; the cause, gathering of accumulations and the purification of obscurations; the assistant, the generation of bodhicitta; and the condition, the pure aspiration. 

The point is that if, at the time of death, one cannot maintain this recollection of Amitabha and his host, even if one spent a lifetime aspiring to birth in Sukhavati, one will not succeed in the end. From this perspective, mere faith is not a sufficient cause, in our tradition.

Who are "they?" Some modern academicians? 

There are all kinds of grades of bodhi, that is not at issue here. We can certainly consider tenth stage bodhisattvas a type of buddha, since the Abhisamayālaṃkāra deems it so, since their omniscience is very nearly that of a samyasaṃbuddha. But to claim that arhats and pratyekabuddhas cannot be roused from their samadhi a) defies scripture b) defies logic. In the first place, we have already agreed that there is scriptural evidence that arhats, etc. are roused. In the second place, asserting they cannot be roused means they are essentially icchantikas, that their continuums have ceased to exist, and so on. Moreover, such as assertion harms the bodhisattva path, because the consequence of this assertion is that no one can attain samyaksambuddhahood, not even the buddha, since as soon as their afflictions are completely eradicated, a bodhisattva can no longer proceed on the bodhisattva path. So I stand by my initial claim. There is no such thing as a śrāvakabuddha. They may not like the idea since an arhat, once roused from cessation, has to begin at the Mahāyāna path of accumulation, rendering them effectively ordinary sentient beings.

The elimination of afflictions is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for buddhahood. Also seventh stage bodhisattvas eradicate the afflictive obscuration entirely, but they do not then attain buddhahood. 

As for arhats being roused from a samadhi of cessation, this is standard Mahāyāna doxology.

It's not like that. Despite whatever petty quarrels people have, all Dharma is good in the beginning, the middle, and the end. For example, Zhen li is a Jodo Shinshu person, he always slips in a plug for Jodo Shinshu, where ever he can. He's really on about other power, etc. We couldn't say that he is making a mistake by forgoing Dzogchen teachings. He has likely even received some. But he is into Jodo Shinshu. All we can say is that from a Dzogchen point of view, the practices and teachings that belong to the nine yānas are based on mind (citta) and not gnosis (jñāna). But we don't expect that others will agree.

No. b) is not an aspiration. It is a guaranteed result of practicing the path for people of minimal diligence. One doesn't need to have faith in the aspirations of this or that buddha or rely on "other power" in order to take birth in these buddhafields. However, one does need to a) have the fortune to meet Dzogchen teachings, b) have faith in them, and c) try to put them into practice as best one can.

It is not a competition however. Sukhavati teachings are a perfectly suitable and valid path.

Sure, but most practitioners are not Dzogchen practitioners. And a lot of Vajrayāna practitioners like to hedge their bets. But Dzogchen practitioners don't need to be concerned about this, but if they like to recite aspirations for birth in Sukhavati, there is no problem with this either. Everytime I recite the Bhadracaryapranidhana, etc., I don't deliberately exclude the aspiration for birth in Sukhavati. But I also know that for me it is not necessary. YMMV.

Just to add a point: Dzogchen is its own vehicle, it does not depend on the lower vehicles in any way. One can of course approach it from lower vehicles, but it is independent and stands on its own.

There are some well-known pure lands: Khechari realm, where the vidyādharas hang out (but you only get there by realizing mahāmudra); the Copper Colored Mountain where Padmasambhava hangs out; Sukhavati where the Amitabha devotees hang out. There is Tara's pure land, called the Turquoise realm, Avalokiteśvara's pure land, Mt. Potala in S. India, Mañjuśrī's pure land, Wutai Shan, in China, Medicine Buddha's pure land (which you can take birth in if you recite the dhāraṇi of Medicine Buddha seven times every day), etc. All of these pure lands are "generated nirmāṇakāya" pure lands, which arose out of the aspiration of this or that bodhisattva to purify a buddhafield, one of the important deeds of a bodhisattva on the stages. 

There are also natural nirmāṇakāya buddhafields, which are buddhafields emanated by the five sambhogkāya buddha families. Birth in these is guaranteed for the average practitioner of Dzogchen teachings, people who have received Dzogchen teachings but are unable to practice them well in this life. 

The special feature of these nirmāṇakāya buddhafields is that the door to the three realms is permanently closed, and perfect, full buddhahood is attained within five hundred human years, without taking another birth in samsara, rather than the interminably long, albeit blissful and edifying, time one spends in other pure lands. It should also be mentioned that middling practitioners of Dzogchen attain perfect, full buddhahood in the bardo. The best practitioners attain perfect, full buddhahood either in this life or at the moment of death.

No, there is scriptural support for the idea all _can_ become Buddhas. Even the Lotus only asserts a prediction. Such assertions are interpretable, like the teachings on buddhanature itself. Thus is not a guarantee that all will become Buddhas. This is why Indian Madhyamakas, no slouches when it comes to reading and interpreting sutras, deny the existence of icchantikas while allowing that there are some beings so benighted that they will never attain buddhahood.

They amount to a “Sure, buddy, you can do it!” In contrast to the sourpuss shravakayana assertions that one has to receive a prediction in person from a buddha, while being male and so on. 

And, if all sentient beings are actually going to become Buddhas, thus undermines the reason for having bodhicitta in the first place. There are a number of negative consequences for taking such a position literally.

You have to distinguish between two types of gotra, or inclination for awakening: natural and activated. 

Only those sentient beings who have activated their inclination for awakening will attain buddhahood. There is no guarantee that all sentient beings will awaken to full buddhahood, since there is no guarantee that all sentient beings will eventually take birth as human beings with eight freedoms and ten endowments and meet the Dharma. And meeting the Dharma is the condition for attaining Buddhahood. And, the Buddha did say:

Misdeeds cannot be washed away with water.
Suffering cannot be removed by hand.
I cannot give liberation to you, 
but I can demonstrate the path.

Meeting the path of the Dharma always requires some cause, some gathering of merit. No one can meet the Dharma and practice the path without first attaining the precious human birth. Various examples are taught by the Buddha to illustrate the rarity of the fully qualified human birth, one of the most famous of which is that a precious human birth is as rare as a blind sea turtle who rises to the surface of the ocean every one hundred years, and just happens to put his head through a golden yoke that has been floating on the surface of the ocean. 

So, no, there is no valid Mahāyāna tradition that teaches it is inevitable that all sentient beings will attain buddhahood. It is a realistic probability that some sentient beings, despite having the potential to attain buddhahood, will never gather the causes and conditions for meeting the Dharma, much less even be reborn as a human being who can attain buddhahood.

Mahayāna refuge can be taken by visualizing the Buddhas and bodhisattvas in front of you and reciting refuge formula. You do not need a preceptor. This system is clearly taught in the Mahāyāna sūtra. However, you should not let other people's religious trips make you anxious.

There are many good teachers out there. But you have a lot of learn just about General Buddhadharma to begin with. It's better to make a connection with a principle lineage, and then when you know what you are doing, continue from there. 

I do not recommend connection with rando teachers on the internet. 

Making a connection with a guru is serious business and many so-called teachers presenting themselves as as so-called gurus have concocted or exaggerated credentials. Nor do they have any idea how to care for their students. Being a teacher is a serious responsibility, as is being a student. 

So one has to be discerning in the beginning. You have to be like a bee, and see which teachers and lineages resonate, and then investigate them, and see what faults and qualities they have. What you do not need is an old fraud like me.

Can you imagine, "the female deities of washing water...."  Thanks, I'll keep "goddesses."

Anyway, goddess is a fine English word, as is god:

goddess (n.)
mid-14c., female deity in a polytheistic religion, from god + fem. suffix -esse (see -ess). The Old English word was gyden, corresponding to Dutch godin, German Göttin, Danish gudine, Swedish gudinna. Of mortal women by 1570s. Related: Goddesshood.

god (n.)
Origin and meaning of god
also God; Old English god "supreme being, deity; the Christian God; image of a god; godlike person," from Proto-Germanic *guthan (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian, Dutch god, Old High German got, German Gott, Old Norse guð, Gothic guþ), which is of uncertain origin; perhaps from PIE *ghut- "that which is invoked" (source also of Old Church Slavonic zovo "to call," Sanskrit huta- "invoked," an epithet of Indra), from root *gheu(e)- "to call, invoke." The notion could be "divine entity summoned to a sacrifice."

But some trace it to PIE *ghu-to- "poured," from root *gheu- "to pour, pour a libation" (source of Greek khein "to pour," also in the phrase khute gaia "poured earth," referring to a burial mound; see found (v.2)). "Given the Greek facts, the Germanic form may have referred in the first instance to the spirit immanent in a burial mound" [Watkins]. See also Zeus. In either case, not related to good.

It results in strained sadhana translations.

But it is a fairly arbitrary choice.

Yes, inherent existence, an existence that is nondependent, is a false concept that we negate in relation to mere existence, an existence that arises dependent on causes and conditions. When we search for inherent existence, we cannot find it. That nonfinding is called "emptiness." For example, we can say a pot is empty of water, without implying there is water somewhere else. No one refutes this kind if negation, if they do, it is what is termed an exaggeration, no one argues that saying something is empty of water necessarily implies water elsewhere. Also, no one can argue that the perception of the absence of water is invalid. Sion's thesis, that one cannot perceive an absence is foolish and naive. As I said, he is an idiot.


Author: Malcolm

Title: Re: Emptiness as negation

It is very faulty. Buddha's awakening was predicted on seeing dependent origination. Whatever is empty is dependently originated, whatever is dependent originated is empty. Negations are merely an analytical manner of approximating emptiness. Negations are not themselves the insight into the absence of inherent existence of dependently originated phenomena. When an ārya cognizes emptiness, they are cognizing the emptiness of something, and that something is always something which arises dependent on causes and conditions. 

So, basically Avi Sion is an idiot who did not bother to even understand the thought of the person he was refuting.

But we don't care. Likewise there are many sutras likely composed in China that are important to Chinese Buddhists, and they don't care that we do not accept them.

The term "snying thig" in actuality refers to the teaching of the Seventeen Tantras, that is where the term comes from. Of the many teachings called "snying thig," only the Vima Snying thig, Bla ma yang thig, and the Zab mo yang thig are solely devoted to the teachings of the Seventeen Tantras. The mKha' 'gro Snying thig is based in the klong gsal tantra, which is sort of a compilation of the key topics of the Seventeen Tantras. Then there is the Ati zab don of Terdag Lingpa, this is about is stripped down a Dzogchen Snying thig cycle as one is likely to find. Most of the others, including the dgongs pa zang thal, focus mainly on the teachings of the Seventeen Tantras, but have other more elaborate cycles for intermediate practitioners. 

All the other snying thigs have supporting practices derived principally from Anuyoga, but their dzogchen teachings are based on the utterly secret unsurpassed cycle, so they can be included in "snying thig". Otherwise, the term "snying thig" has become kind of a popular name.

The same qualm applies to Kālacakra, the Lotus Sūtra, etc. However, in the case of the Sound Tantra, it is the definitive text of the system of Dzogchen, so regardless of whether one accepts its claims for itself, it occupies the most important position among all tantras of the great perfection, and thus cannot be ignored because it makes claims that text critical scholarship is likely to dismiss.  Text critical scholarship is limited by artifacts, physical objects, and inferences and deductions it can safely make on the basis of that evidence. So, it is limited.

Yes, the datable appearance of the Sound Tantra is around 1060 CE, after the passing of Atisha, and but well before the turn of the 12th century. But that is just a dating of a physical artifact. The original Sound Tantra, taught to beings of apparitional birth by the first nirmāṇakāya in the first minor eon of this major eon by Nangwa Dampa, was taught in the language of birds, not the language of Oḍḍiyāna, Sanskrit, or Tibetan.

Nevertheless, the PATHS are different. There are in general three types of paths: renunciation (Hinayāna, Common Mahāyāna), transformation (lower tantras, mahāyoga and anuyoga), and self-liberation (Ati, Mahāmudra). 

The confusion arises because the word renunciation in English translates different terms in Tibetan. Renunciation as a path is termed "spangs (utkṣiptā) lam," literally "the path of discarding or giving up." Where as the idea of renunciation of samsara is niḥsaraṇa (nges par 'byung). So yes, all Buddhists paths are predicated on niḥsaraṇa, but not all Buddhists path are predicated on the idea of utkṣiptā.

I am not claiming that every case of OCD is a seizure related disorder without evidence, and there are a wide variety of behaviors associated with OCD, but it is certainly the case that seizure disorders correlate with OCD, and I suspect, in the end we will discover that most OCD is brain based.

I don’t really have much patience for appeals to poetics, and find that a lot of sloppy thinking gets excused in the name of “poetry.”

It’s true that there is a great deal of metaphor employed in various classes of Buddhist literature, but it must be treated with care, it’s employment is generally not so obvious. For example, the nine classic examples of tathagatagarbha, understood incorrectly lead one directly to holding a nonBuddhist view of self. On the other hand there is a correct way to understand these examples, which actually lead one to a definitive understanding the absence of identity taught by the Buddha. However, most people take theses examples literally and so wind up holding wrong views.

He is the gold standard. No one matches Longchenpa's achievements in writing and systematizing Dzogchen for later generations. Everyone who comes later, including Bonpos, are not even building on Longchenpa's work, it is so definitive. At best they just summarize and simplifying what he covers extensively.

In this case it means a bstan 'dzin, a śāsanadhara. The actual name of the Buddha's teaching is śāsana. A śāsanadhara is one who "holds the teaching." There is a gap in the prediction in the Sound Tantra of the holders of the Dzogchen teaching between Longchenpa and the ḍākini mentioned above. Recently, Khenchen Namdrol mentioned this, apologizing slightly while stating that even tertons cannot be considered "holders of the Dzogchen teaching" in the sense mentioned above. Of course everyone who has received Dzogchen teachings is a brgyud 'dzin, paraṃparādhara, or holder of the lineage in a minor sense.

But in reality, what I mean is that no one other than Longchenpa could have written his treasures, with all his finesse and mastery of the seventeen tantras and their commentaries, not to mention the whole of Buddhist scholarship. There has been no Tibetan like him since he passed away in the middle of the 14th century. I am not talking about realization. Thousands of Tibetans have realized Dzogchen teachings to the highest level. I am talking about true mastery expressed for the benefit of sentient beings, and frankly, no one compares to him. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu himself said that among Tibetans, Longchenpa is the final word on Dzogchen.

Dharmatā is a complicated technical term, used in many contexts. It is usually contrasted with dharmin. In short, in the context it is used in Buddhapalita is illustrated in one case in this way. Take this passage, which is a very minor point, but I would do it differently:

།དེ་བཞིན་དུ་གཞན་ནས་ཀྱང་འདུས་བྱས་དེ་ནི་སླུ་བའི་ཆོས་ཀྱང་ཡིན། དེ་ནི་རབ་ཏུ་འཇིག་པའི་ཆོས་ཀྱང་ཡིན་ནོ་ཞེས་འདུ་བྱེད་ཐམས་ཅད་སླུ་བའི་ཆོས་ཅན་ཡིན་
པར་གསུངས་སོ། །དེའི་ཕྱིར་འདུ་བྱེད་ཐམས་ཅད་སླུ་བའི་ཆོས་ཉིད་དེས། ཐམས་ཅད་བརྫུན་པ་ཉིད་ཡིན་ཏེ།

Coughlin (pg. 174, line 3-6) has:

Furthermore, he also declared in another [sūtra]:

Conditioned states are also deceptive phenomena. They are also phenomena that fully distintegrate.

This states that all formations are deceptive phenomena. Since all formations are deceptive phenomena, therefore, all of them are false.

I would have rendered this passage in this way:

In the same way, elsewhere [he stated] that all formations are deceptive phenomena (dharmin), "The compounded are also deceptive phenomena (dharma), and they are also phenomena that totally perish." Therefore, since all formations have deceptive natures (dharmatā), all are false.

Otherwise, his translation is just fine.

One may come to adopt a mantra as one's personal, regular mantra by oneself due to karma from previous lives, without the direct intercession of a teacher in this life.

This is just your own fabrication, with no support from any source. 

I am afraid here, you are closer to Black Liberation than Danpag.

The commentary makes it clear that this single void is not the same as "space with qualities." Other than that, there is not much else on this point. 

Basically, the quality of "formed" space is sound, whose particles correspond to taste, and who permeate the other four elements and provide space between objects. See Ornament of Stainless Light, Khedrup Norzang Gyatso, pg. 79, and page 87m ,where he discusses this passage specifically. He says this space, which is a dimension where the particles of the five elements are disconnected, is a "mere emptiness" or as I translated above, a void.

There are many dubious texts found in the collected works of various people, just as there are dubious texts found in the Kenjur and Tenjur. Buton excluded hundreds of tantras from the Kenjur because, in his opinion, they were of dubious origin. Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo gives an entire list of kriya tantras, including the Tārā Tantra, which are forgeries, in his opinion. 

For example, I have found texts authored by Tibetans that were repurposed as termas. In one case, a core text of Lamdre authored by Sachen Kunga Nyingpo was repurposed and included in the collected termas of a rather famous 17th century terton, whose name I won't mention, because some feelings might be hurt. 

There are a lot of politics around what gets included and excluded from a given collection. So yes, there is often a "need to second guess the whole process of how such collections are compiled, the knowledge and qualifications of the individuals and communities doing the compiling and so forth..."

Actually, according to the commentary by Lama Dampa (who composed the most extensive Tibetan commentary on the text), it refers to a void with lacks qualities. Hinam in this context refers to the ordinary five elements, tattva refers to the principle (tattvahinam, de nyid kyis dman pa'o) which is the single void (stong pa gcig pu) that pervades the five elements, so it is not space at all in the normal sense of the term. So this translation you are relying on is also slightly incorrect. It should be something like:

Outside that is the single void, separate from the three realms, the principle devoid of qualities that [pervades] the inferior [elements].

Title: Re: Regular mantra as opposed to...?

There are no such teachings in Buddhadharma which contradict this. You can't name even one. For example, the Vajramāla Tantra states:

A mantra is not to be given
to a sentient being who has not received empowerment,
nor should the wise show an image
or a book to such a one. 

Similar admonitions occur in Kālacakra, Abhidhānottaratantra, Mahāmudrātilaka, and so on. As far as practicing secret mantra goes without a proper teacher and empowerment, this is strictly prohibited for the same reason. The Mahāmudrātilaka states:

Whoever pridefully elucidates 
the tantras and upadeśas to one lacking empowerment
as soon as they die, both master and disciple
go to hell, even if siddhi is obtained. 

And:

If one pleases the guru, the king of mantras
will doubtlessly be attained.
If it is not attained in that way, it is faulty,
and even if one receives a mantra, it will not be effective. 

Even in lower tantras, it is the same, for example, the Vairocana-abhisambodhi states:

Without empowerment, the source of secret gnosis, 
there is no mantra. 

And of course in the Tenjur, there are hundreds of such admonitions.

Similarly, when a nirmāṇakāya manifests the deed of birth, it does not come from anywhere, not more than a rainbow comes from somewhere in the sky when the causes and conditions for its appearance are present.

Thubten Phuntsok is arguing for their correct application, apart from prayer flags, which are just a pre-Buddhist custom in Tibet, as everyone knows:

On prayer flags:

Throwing up papers printed with mani and other mantras everywhere has two negative consequences – from the religious point of view it shows disrespect to the mantras; and from the scientific point of view it causes pollution to the land. Hence the throwing of paper prayer-flags is harmful both for this and the next life. This is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

On treasure vases:

These water bodies that have never witnessed any pollution are contaminated. Living things in these larger waters die whereas smaller water bodies dry up. Large lakes turn dirty as can be seen from many pictures available online. This too is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

On life ransom:

But the fish suffer 1. they suffer from being caught in the first place; 2. they suffer as they are transported long distances from east to west and consequently many die because of a lack of native water. Hence water bodies are filled with dead fish and they become polluted. This too is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

On vegetarianism: 

But for the poor and subsistence of ordinary people, this choice does not exist. In the Kham region of eastern Tibet, because of the ban on eating meat, a large quantity of old and out of date food items from cities are transported and sold in villages where Tibetans live. This has become a kind of habit for people to show off by eating these Chinese foods. This is one of the main consequences of banning eating of meat. This too is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

He concludes:

Tibet may be filled with monks
But the land is filled with conflicts,
They may be praying for world peace
But their land is filled with fighting.

Mountains and valleys are filled with prayer-flags
Amidst these flags are the carcasses of dead yaks,
Businessmen may ransom many fish
But dead bodies of these fish fill the water bodies.

Nomads avoid slaughtering
But lamas commit murders,
Farmers abide by the five precepts
But monks engage in sexual acts.

There are things here in Tibet
That do not exist elsewhere,
This religious education,
A la la! What a wonder!

And every words of what he says is true. Frankly, your only complaint is that he advocates that Tibetans become educated in tshan rig, science, because when they do, they will abandon some traditional practices when they understand that they do not correspond to the principle of cause and effect. It is also well known that he thinks practices like mantra healing and so are completely fraudulent. But that is his right. Just as you have the right to credulously accept any story you hear about this lama and that lama, he has the right to doubt these things. But from his point of view, Tibetans are being ripped of and exploited by their own religious and secular authorities, and that, and nothing else, was the real cause of the Chinese Invasion of Tibet. 

Tibet, prior to the fall, was a corrupt, medieval society, where aristocrats felt they could treat common people anyway they liked, where there was no democracy, and so on. It is not a surprise to discover that most of the Red Guards who engaged in the cultural revolution in Tibet were Tibetan cadres made up of illiterate Tibetan peasants, and not Chinese cadres. After the 13th Dalai passed in 1936, the Lhasa elites became too absorbed in their own power games to look up and see the train that was bearing down on them, the 14th Dalai Lama was too young to fend off the Communists, and those in Eastern Tibet were apathetic to hostile to the Lhasa Gvt. 

You can claim all you like that building this statue and following that prophecy would have saved Tibet the indignity of being occupied by the Chinese Communists, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20. It is very common to blame the other guy for your own problems—— So sectarian Nyingmapas and Kagyupas blame the Gelukpas (like you are doing here), sectarian Gelukpas blame the Nyingmas and the Kagyus, etc. 

The reality is that Tibet was not a unified nation, it was more like Germany or Italy in the mid 19th century. It was not unified, there was no effective national army with modern weapons and training. At the root of the issue was that the Khampas, hating Lhasa rule, did little to nothing to prevent the Chinese occupation. Similarly, the Amdowas did little to nothing to prevent the Chinese occupation. The history of the Chinese Occupation is well documented, so these facts are not disputable. 

To reiterate: Tibet fell because it was not a unified country. That Lhasa nobles ignored advice from Khampa lamas is not surprising in the least. So, in reality, the real cause of the fall of Tibet was elite self-absorption combined with seething ethnic rivalry, which resulted in a situation where Tibetans, divided amongst themselves, could not stand against the Chinese occupation, a state of affairs that continues to this day.

It's pretty bad. Monasteries have no means of waste disposal, so they just pitch their garbage over the sides of ravines, where it washes down into rivers. 

The Tibetan landscape is littered with millions upon millions of plastic bags, which get caught on fences, prayer flags to modern consumerism. In many places in Amdo the forests were cut down before the Chinese arrived in force, for example, Amdo used to have millions of acres of forest land, which was all leveled for pasturing sheep in the 30's and 40's. The only reason the trees in Kham were not similarly raised is that the those forests are on steep mountain sides. Now there is very little old growth forest left in Amdo. Of course, the Tibetans in U and Tsang cut down all their trees more than a thousand years ago. Tibetans are human beings, with the same faults as everyone else. They are not masters of deep ecology or conservationism by any means. The Tibetans themselves hunted snow leopards, as well as Himalayan tigers, nearly to extinction. They hunted lions into extinction in their territory, .

We have to work with scripture and reasoning, and see what shakes out from that. 

Since the fourth empowerment is given with words, it can be given online. 
Since the gnosis of the wisdom consort empowerment is only symbolic now, it can be given online. 
Since the secret empowerment too is a symbolic blessing of speech, which is no longer practiced according to the requirements of the ancient manuals, it too can be given online. Thus the three inner empowerments can be given online.

The eleven empowerments of the vase empowerments however, require the disciple to receive actual substances from the guru at some point during the rite. Therefore it cannot be given online. Therefore, major empowerments cannot be given or received online. Not only this, but the preparation day for a major empowerment contains many procedures needed to make the disciple a suitable recipient for each one of the four main empowerments in the rite.  

Meaning empowerments (don dbang) sometimes also called symbolic empowerments (brda dbang) can be given on line. In particular, since these generally include the empowerment of the potential of vidyā (rig pa'i rtsal dbang), they are satisfactory as ripening empowerments. Also, the empowerment of the potential of vidyā alone, sometimes calls "direct introduction" is satisfactory as a ripening empowerment. This is because the empowerment of the potential of vidyā is the mother of all other empowerments. 

Permissions (rje gnang) can be given online. Blessings (byin brlabs) cannot, since they also require substances. 

The idea that one can receive empowerments and lungs from recordings is not reasonable, just as it is not reasonable to claim one can receive monastic ordination from a recording. Someone who claims to have received such empowerments and lungs via recordings should understand that other people will not accept this.

That very much depends on what one understands the element of air to be. If one understands it to be the motile property of matter, as described Abhidharma, and so on, it works just fine.

Not only this, the great Tibetan scholar Desi Sangye Gyatso, points out in his commentary on the medical tantra, that the way things are presented in the tantras is obscure, and the same things are presented in the medical literature openly. Zurkhar opines that central, right, and left channels are respectively the arterial system, the venous system, and the nervous/lymphatic system, and that further, the way nāḍīs exist in the body is not the same as the way they are visualized and not need be. Further, the Kalacakra points out that the lower ends of these three nadis are the the urethra, the seminal vesicle channel, and the rectum, further indicating that they are to be understood as physical structures in the body, but not as they are visualized. If you want to understand these things properly, you ought to study Ayurveda or Tibetan Medicine rather than making a mishmash by trying to adapt these things to some modern scientists naive attempt to explain ancient knowledge systems and make it fit with modern science.

Certainly it is the air element. 

There are only four or five elements that make the human body. One of those is air. If you wish to confirm this read the Nandagarbhavikranti sūtra, which describes how the air element shapes the fetus over its thirty-eight week gestational period. Or, you can read the Vajra Rosary Tantra, which is now in English translation, and is one of the primary sources for the doctrine of the ten vāyus and how they function in the human body. Or you can read the Profound Inner Meaning by the Third Karmapa, which unifies the teachings of the vajra body in one place, translated by Elizabeth Callahan.

Translating the word vāyu/rlung as "energy" is fashionable, but it is also completely inaccurate.

I don't agree. People are conditioned in our culture to accept cartesian dualism from the cradle. The reason why people turn away from theistic religion in general is that it does not correspond to their experience. They have never experienced consciousness in any way other than through their physical senses. Those who have a notion of an immaterial self or consciousness have it because they have been conditioned to think the mind (soul) and body are different by 500 years of Cartesianism. They don' have to be philosophical to be influenced by ideas that have been dominant themes in our culture for hundreds of years. 

Buddhist substance dualism is predicated on different principles that cartesian dualism. But we can see it still provokes problems for Westerners by their difficulty in distinguishing the Buddhist principal of karmic transmigration from the Neoplatonic/Christian concept of the soul (psyche).

LSD is gone from your system in 6 hours, max. It has no known toxic side effects. Pure LSD is the cleanest drug out there. However, LSD found on the street may not be manufactured under ideal laboratory conditions, or be counterfeit. Therefore, it should not be ingested. 

However, with renewed interest psychedelics, properly manufactured LSD administered clinically is complete safe, from a toxicity point of view. I haven't done LSD myself since 1979, I wouldn't take anything found on the street today at all. The downside to acid is that it lasts a good 12 hours. This is why people like DMT and analogues, because it lasts ten minutes.

He is making a different point, he is claiming these practices do not yield the promised benefits (and in the case of prayer flags, do not even have a Buddhist origin), that the pursuit of them robs poor Tibetans of money better spent elsewhere, and so on, that practices like life ransom (srog bslu), in the manner in which it is pursued in Tibet, is harmful to the rivers and streams of Tibet through the introduction of invasive species from China, and that the push towards vegetarianism is a result of the undue influence of Chinese Buddhism, which comes at the expense of the health of Tibetan people, who have traditionally enjoyed a diet high in dairy and meat. 


Frankly, I don't approve of the practice of life release. It is generally practiced without thought of the consequences for the local environment:

In Asian Buddhist societies, life release has led to significant ecological harm when invasive species, parasites and disease are introduced to wild populations of animals. It has led to the introduction of American bullfrogs in China and tilapia and red-eared sliders, a species of turtle, in Taiwan, according to the Society for Conservation Biology.

The practice has also caused problems outside of Asia. In 2017, two Buddhists from London were fined a total of £28,000 (about $36,000) after pleading guilty to illegally releasing more than 700 non-native crabs and lobsters into the Atlantic Ocean off the English coast, according to the Guardian.

The welcome you received was in response to the tone of your greeting. Some of us have been practicing these teachings for three decades and moreover, read Tibetan and have clocked many hours sitting at the feet of such masters as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, and so on. Making statements like "I am intimately familiar with rigpa (in my own spontaneus way)" is laughable from someone who has never sat and received Dzogchen teachings. 

As for calling you a fool and thief, I didn't call you either thing. I said, "Reading Dzogchen texts, and other tantric texts without transmission is indeed worthless, improper, and condemned in those very texts themselves. Only fools ignore this" and "Do not read Dzogchen books prior to having received transmission and instruction. Otherwise, you are being a thief of the teachings. This is very negative." 

As for the first statement, this is because no one these days can understand Dzogchen teachings immediately, even with proper transmission. Not even Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche understood the meaning of Dzogchen immediately.  Before he met his root guru, he had thirteen Dzogchen teachers and had received the whole tradition of Buddhist Dzogchen teachings. It was only when he sat with Rigzin Changchub Dorje that he understand the real meaning of Dzogchen teachings. As for the second statement, Dzogchen teachings are guarded by very powerful guardians. While some claim the Bonpos assert their guardians have loosened restrictions on Dzogchen teachings, this is not the case with Buddhist Dzogchen teachings. There are no lineage masters of Buddhist Dzogchen teachings who can loosen such restrictions, because the last lineage holder of Dzogchen teachings was Longchen Rabjam, and there won't be another one for thousands of years. Thus, since the guardians are the owners of the teachings, one who transgresses the seal of secrecy placed on Dzogchen teachings risks their wrath. 

While it is often said that Dzogchen is the teaching for this age, for many reasons, this does not mean that people can just do what they like with them. The integrity of Dzogchen teachings is maintained through respecting the methods of transmission and promulgation of Dzogchen teachings described in the Dzogchen tantras themselves and the commentaries on them by ancient masters such as Vimalamitra, and so on. You haven't even begun to learn about such things because you have no teacher. 

You are confused because some teachers like my guru, Tenzin Wangyal, HH Dalai Lama, and so on, have published some books that are "open," meaning that they describe a little bit about the Dzogchen teaching. But actually, they really do not say very much at all. They offer only a glimpse for the curious, nothing more. 

So if you are actually interested in becoming a practitioner of Dzogchen, rather than just adding to the collection of spiritual teachings you have gathered, develop some humility, go find a qualified teacher of Dzogchen, and listen more than you talk.

Ritual isn’t, but the necessity for empowerment and instruction is. There are also Dzogchen preliminary practices, which are indispensable.

You cannot expect the tradition to adapt to you. Instead you have to adapt to the tradition.

Yes, calendars in Tibetan Buddhism are calculated on the basis of instructions found in the Vimalaprabha commentary of Kalacakra, of which there are two systems: Phukluk, followed by most schools; and Tsurluk, followed by Karma Kagyu. The latter places new years one month prior to the former.

As long as you have this perennialist idea, you will never understand Dzogchen. There is no awareness in which we all partake. In fact, Dzogchen explicitly rejects this idea as eternalism.

The most important choice is making one's choice of a guru. It is not a light choice, and qualified gurus who can actually teach Dzogchen are vanishing rapidly, there are virtually none under sixty that I know of personally, and not very many above sixty left either. 

Of course, there are many qualified lamas who can give this "Dzogchen" empowerment and that empowerment, but teaching Dzogchen is something very specific, and has very little to do with practicing mantras and getting involved with complicated tantric systems, per se.

There is a lot of hanging out the tail of white deer to sell venison, and sending off the customer with a packet of horse meat. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu used to complain about this all the time. In other words, there are a number of teachers who advertise themselves as Dzogchen teachers, who are really are guilty of false advertising and worse. 

Caveat emptor.

Such a teacher is not a teacher who is teaching Dzogchen in a correct way. You cannot study these texts without transmission. Transmission comes with responsibilities. There is no authentic teacher of Dzogchen who will permit you to read these texts without proper transmission. That means receiving empowerment, the reading transmission for the text you want to practice or study, and the instruction on that text, called wang, lung, and tri.

Yes, but without a teacher there is no Dzogchen to speak of. One cannot introduce themselves to Dzogchen. It is impossible. The Dzogchen tantras themselves assert that this is the case. A book cannot introduce one to Dzogchen, etc. Claiming otherwise is irresponsible, basically, one is breaking samaya to make a claim that one can study and practice Dzogchen without a guru, on one's own, from a book. Worse, one is encouraging others to travel down a false path.

We can completely ignore that, at least I have. Gadamer has zero influence on my work. I just don't cotton to Spenglarian interpretations of culture and history. 

We work from commentaries and just translate what the texts actually say, as best we can. That's a function of understanding both the context and grammar of the source language, as well as being able to compose adequate sentences in the target language. Everything else is extraneous to that.

You can examine my work for yourself.

No translation is perfect, of course. But we do not need to pile theories upon theories, particularly by people who never did any serious translation work in their entire lives.

FFS, modern hermeneutics begin with Schleiermacher, and text critical methodology predates H by centuries, originating during the Enlightenment, in the West. Also Tsongkhapa, Buton, Ngorchen, and so on were astute text critical scholars, who needed to wade through multiple translations and compare them. And H’s Ancient Greek was a pretense.and let’s not even begin to discuss Vasubandhu, Candrakirti, and so on, who all were astute text critical scholars and practitioners of hermeneutics.
