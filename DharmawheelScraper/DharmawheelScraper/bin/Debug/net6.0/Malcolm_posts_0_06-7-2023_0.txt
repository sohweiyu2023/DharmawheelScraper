In dzogchen, dependent origination explains the origin of ma rig pa. If one does not grasp the origin of ma rig pa, axiomatically , one does not have rig pa.

Actually, this is wrong. He never denied or deflected anything. Trungpa never made any excuses for anything he did. I don't have any solid opinion on whether he was a mahāsiddha or not, but he was a real Dzogchen practitioner, and I have no doubt he attained liberation in the bardo. There were many signs at his cremation. 

As Āryadeva points out, quoting the Buddha:

"A deterioration in ethics (śila) is acceptable, 
but [a deterioration] in view is not acceptable at all."
One goes to higher realms through ethics,
but the supreme stage comes about through view.

I do not think this is fair assessment. He coined the term quite early, and while he certainly related the concept to Padmasambhava's role as a teacher trying to tame Tibetans, and by inference, what it takes to tame savage westerners, if you read his two seminal seminars on the idea, it's much more related to Dzogchen. Specifically, he related Dorje Drollo to discovering that one's primordial state is beyond being harmed by negative deeds or benefited by positive deeds. 

For example, he explicitly says in his book that "crazy wisdom" is not part of the mahāmudra tradition:

Student: Has the crazy-wisdom teaching developed in any lineages other than the Nyingma lineage? 

Trungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. There is also the mahamudra lineage, which is based on a sense of precision and accuracy. But the crazy-wisdom lineage that I received from my guru seems to have much more potency. It is somewhat illogical—some people might find the sense of not knowing how to relate with it quite threatening. It seems to be connected with the Nyingma tradition and the maha ati lineage exclusively.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition. 

You see, in Nyingma there are four classes of manifestation: peaceful, semi-wrathful, wrathful, and crazy. Only Dorje Drollo really qualifies for the last category. The practice of Drollo is very much related to the eight classes which cause so much trouble today, which makes it perhaps among the most effective yidam practices for the modern era, as I have asserted before. To practice Drollo, one really has to go beyond hope and fear.

Well, since the mind is already settled into an ego trip, I think the point is to dislodge it.

In any case, the book is pretty precise about what Trungpa meant when he coined the term. For example:

In the case of the primordial craziness of crazy wisdom, we do not permit ourselves to get seduced by passion or aroused by aggression at all. We relate with these experiences as they are, and if anything comes up in the midst of that complete ordinariness and begins to make itself into a big deal, then we cut it down—without any special reference to what is good and what is bad.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition.

So really, Trungpa's intent was that one use crazy wisdom for oneself. It has been poorly misunderstood to be something that teachers use with students.

As it relates to relating with students, he says:

The essence of crazy wisdom is that you have no strategized programs or ideals anymore at all. You are just open. Whatever students present, you just react accordingly.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition. 

And of course, ultimately, for Trungpa, crazy wisdom means to be beyond hope and fear:

Until we realize the true implication of hopelessness, we have no chance of understanding crazy wisdom at all, ladies and gentlemen.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition. 

Honestly, its his best book.

That is also valid, and not necessarily cause for alarm. We have to allow teachers to exercise their own prerogatives in terms of what they want to teach and to whom.

I honestly don't see much point in people who do not practice Tibetan Medicine getting involved in the YN. The reason the retreats in it are short, etc., is because it is a practice designed for busy physicians. But this does not apply to other people. Why? Because the YN is intended for people of great merit and little time. Other peoples time is better spent receiving teachings in Longchen Nyinthig, Dudjom Tersar, and so on.

It's more common than you might imagine. It's not necessarily a red flag, however. Some lamas only wish to devote their time to students who are dedicated to one practice lineage. Quite honestly, if someone came to me and explicitly said, "I want to learn about Dzogchen, but I really prefer keep practicing x," I'd say, "You're wasting both of our time. The teachings are not something we study just for idle interest. Come back when you are serious about Dzogchen teachings and are interested in making them your primary focus."  It's a bit of a fault to take Vajrayāna teachings merely out of curiosity or some attempt at being "ris med."

"All" means all. Everything we do in this life, apart from practicing the dharma, is pointless and just causes us to continue in samsara. Therefore, in order to make our life meaningful, we practice the dharma. In other words, life is meaningless, but dharma makes it meaningful. The example is a dream, since no matter what we do in a dream, good or bad, when we wake up, we understand that it was all meaningless, just a dream.

He also unrealistically talks about rebuilding manufacturing in the US. This is highly unrealistic. We have a post-industrial economy. The idea that we can restore an industrial manufacturing base in the US is a pipe dream. Why? The cost of labor is a barrier to manufacture of many goods such as IPhones in the US, etc. This sort of isolationism is naive. 

Kennedy also erroneously claims the US dollar's position as the world's reserve currency is threatened. By what? The RMB? Give me a break. The Chinese economy is in rapid decline. They are freaking out because they cannot maintain the 5.5% growth rate they've targeted. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/how-chinas-economic-slowdown-could-hurt-world#

He is also an advocate of the world's great grift in history: cryptocurrency. This shit is just a ponzi scheme. What a fool.  

His foreign policy solutions are equally inadequate, in that they are nonexistent. His idea—which of course is stupid in this climate of international uncertainty—is to eviscerate the US armed forces, withdraw from the international security agreements we have made, and defund the military. The oft recited figure of "800" bases ignores the fact that the majority of these "bases" are manned by less than 50 personnel and most of these are manned by less than 20 personnel. Most of the large ones are in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and if he thinks those should be dismantled, he should have his head examined. 

His platform makes no mention of the State Department. If he were a serious person about foreign policy, he would be running on platform of increasing the number of career foreign service officers and beefing up State, as well as providing more funding for the CIA, NSA, and our other intelligence services. 

His civil liberties platform also features a conspiracy theory, "in which Big Tech censors, deplatforms, shadowbans, and algorithmically suppresses any person or opinion the government asks them to." This is laughable bullshit. He is just butt hurt because he traffics in lies and conspiracy theories, and Yahoo, etc. don't want to support his bullshit. He has plenty of outlets where he can spew whatever crap he wants to: Rumble, Telegram, Twitch, etc. "Big Tech" is a number of private companies, and particularly in the light of the (absurd) SCOTUS ruling on websites the other day, they just don't have to give him a platform at all. 

He also clearly does not have a firm grasp of the history of pandemics in this country, nor does he understand  vaccination, the need for quarantine in pandemics, etc. The rest of it is just pandering nonsense as well.

Ukrainians fought a war of independence between 1917-1921. Eventually, their war failed, even with German intervention, and Ukraine was absorbed into the USSR. 

For Ukraine to succeed, all that needed to happen was that Russia needed to mind its own damn business and resist the temptation to prevent Ukraine from exercising its' own national prerogative: joining the EU. Which they voted to do, quite legally. The Euromaiden happened precisely because Yakunovich reneged on this aspiration, an aspiration now enshrined in the constitution of Ukraine as of 2019.

A stable Russia, at this point in history, is an impossibility for as long as Putin in power. Russia is the very definition of a kleptocracy. It is run by criminal gangs. Russia needs to be isolated and contained until Russia shows it can play well with others. This likely requires a change in regime. 

Russia is not cornered at all. They keep playing the nuke card, but they have been doing so for more than two decades, and they know quite well no one survives, despite the nihilistic pronouncements by Russian State Television hosts. If you think that Russia is actually going to use nuclear weapons, then you are mad to think there is any negotiated peace to be had. 

There is no scenario where Russia employs even tactical nukes. 1) It would do nothing to halt the advance of UAF. 2) Such a use would be regarded as terrorism since there are no legitimate targets against which Russia could use such a bomb—Ukraine has no nuclear weapons—and would automatically trigger Article 5, since any use of nuclear weapons anywhere on the European continent would be regarded as an attack on NATO. 

https://www.cfr.org/article/if-russia-goes-nuclear-three-scenarios-ukraine-war

Putin just made another aggressive adventure. and rather than the world sitting idly by as they did before, he got called out for his blunder. There is no scenario where Ukraine settles for anything less than a complete Russia withdrawal to pre-2014 borders. All deaths in the "Special Military Operation," no matter which side, are blood on Putin's hands and no one else.

Well, no they do not, actually. The whole reason Mañjuśrīmitra wrote his Cultivation of Bodhicitta was to distinguish Dzogchen from Yogacāra. His ultimate argument refuting Yogacāra is this:


Never separate from the momentary location, at that time, they are mutual;
without one, [the other] does not exist.
Traces do not exist  because they are generated by false concepts.
The all-basis does not exist because its experiential sphere does not exist. Also, those cognitions are nonexistent.
If the supporting [traces] and the location do not exist because partiality does not exist, how can consciousness and cognition arise? 
Therefore this mind too is beyond the extremes of existence and nonexistence, and is free from being one or many. 

[Mipham's comment] 

The momentary all-basis that is the location of the traces and the traces themselves are never separate. When one does not exist, it is necessary that the other does not exist. At that time, without one, the other is impossible. Both their existence and nonexistence are mutual. When those traces do not exist, also that all-basis does not exist, like a result without a cause.

If it is asked, “While that may indeed be the case, why do the traces not exist?,” since traces do not correspond with how those entities exist because they are generated by false concepts, the traces do not exist. If the traces do not exist, since the domain of the all-basis is the traces, its experiential range does not exist. Due to its nonexistence, the all-basis does not exist. If the object of clinging does not exist, all those cognitions do not exist because the consciousness will not exist. 

When both the supporting traces do not exist and the all-basis, the location where they exist, does not exist because the partialities do not exist as shown above, how can consciousness and cognition based on those arise? Therefore, not existing in any way, this mind and its mental factors are beyond the extremes of existence and nonexistence, and are free from being one or many. 


Further, the commentary in the Soaring Garuda, one of the five early lungs, states:

In order to demonstrate the deviation and obscurations of vijñaptimatra: [7/a]

Delusion and the path of awakening cannot be obtained with concepts.

Because atiyoga is true, undeluded about everything, the vijñāptimatra understanding of things as reflections of delusion and the view attained through that is a conceptual imputation of their own. Due to their not seeing this, Smelting the Gold in the Ore states:

Seeing phenomena as delusion is itself fully understood to be delusional.
