No, Tibetans may pronounce mantras however they do, but they accurately represent the long and short vowels, consonants, the the ṭ series and so on correctly. 

My take on this issue (as a professional translator) is that for general translations, there should be a short list of about 20-30 terms that are back translated into Sanskrit -- dharmadhātu, dharmakāya, vajra, prajñapāramita, dharmatā, etc. Then, depending on the specific literature, there may be more technical terms rendered in Sanskrit or not depending on circumstances.

Sucness is not a product, therefore, it is unproduced. Whatever is unproduced is not subject to conditions. Whatever is not subject to conditions is, by strict definition, unconditioned. 

If you deny that suchness is unconditioned, you also disagree with the Madhyamaka school. For example the Tarkajvala states:

"The unconditioned is the two cessations, space and suchness"

The unconditioned is analytical cessation and non-analytical cessation, space and suchness. Analytical cessation is discriminating wisdom i.e. having analyzed and extinguished the evident afflictions, that analysis and cessation is given the name "nirvana". Non-analytical cessation is when a given thing is never separate from cessation by any means. Space opens up room and has the characteristic of being unobstructed. Suchness previously did not exist, nor come to not exist through destruction, is not [presently] mutually dependent and has no basis. Those four are permanent because their nature is unchanging. 

I am afraid that trying prove that idea that suchness is niether conditioned nor unconditioned is fraught with definitional flaws. 

Suchness is not a product, therefore, it is included among among unconditioned phenomena, like space and the two cessations.

Take it up with Vimalamitra. He writes about this in both the Copper Letters and the Agate Letters. 

The vidyā that apprehends characteristics: “the vidyā that imputes phenomena as universals and as mere personal names”, is one’s mere non-conceptual self-knowing awareness defiled by many cognitions. 

The [vidyā that] appropriates the basis creates all cognitions when present in one’s body, and is present as the mere intrinsic clarity [of those cognitions] is called “unripened vidyā”. 

The vidyā present as the basis is the reality of the essence, original purity, that exists possessing the three primordial wisdoms. The vidyā which is not covered by partiality is present as the essence of omniscient wisdom. Further, that primordial wisdom is present as a subtle primordial wisdom. If that primordial wisdom did not exist, there would be no liberation from emptiness. Further, there would be no liberation from the inert. However, if vidyā exists as primordial wisdom, it would be no different than the realist’s nirmanakāya. 

The vidyā of insight is those vivid appearances when the instruction is demonstrated. It is called “the essence of the self-apparent thigle”. As there are many unmixed appearances, the Teacher stated:

Everything arose from non-arising,
showing the great miraculous display in every way. 

The vidyā of thögal is the absence of increase or decrease in experience having reached the full measure of appearance through practice. Having completed all the signs and qualities, also they are not established by their own nature. When self-manifesting as omniscient wisdom, it [the vidyā of thögal] is called “abandoning phenomena”, “the exhaustion of phenomena”, “beyond phenomena”, “liberated from phenomena”, and “no arising even in mere arising”. 

Are those vidyās different or not? They are not different since there is nothing more than a single nature.

Reality is not conditioned. The Dharma comes from recognition of reality. So while the expression of Dharma may be subject to change and adaptation, reality is always there to be perceived.

Not known from another; peaceful; lacking proliferation with proliferations;
non-conceptual; undifferentiated — that is the characteristic of reality.  


Buddhapalita comments:

"'Not known from another"; here not known from another i.e. not scriptural, but one's direct perception, thus it is a convention for one's direct perception. "Peaceful"  is a convention for "empty by nature".  "Lacking proliferation with proliferations" is a convention for freedom from mundane phenomena. "Non-conceptual" means not designated "This is this". Undifferentiated means not different objects such as "though it this, it is also this". Why is that? Because of lacking concepts, there is no proliferation with proliferations. Why? Because there is no proliferation by mundane phenomena. Why? Because that is peaceful, it is undifferentiated. Therefore, the knowledge of such a nature is a personal knowledge, not known from elsewhere. That should be understood to be the characteristic of reality.

According to Mahāyāna, a buddha is in a state of continuous equipoise on reality. It is impossible therefore that a buddha will experience concepts.

Title: Re: Tibetan Astrological "overlap" with others?
Content:
This is a truncated version of a much better version:

When that is applied to the tortoise of the basis, first, out of total nothingness there is the so called "primordially existing or abiding tortoise". And from this arose, or were produced, all the Buddhas of the three times and all the sentient beings of the three realms. The example for that is the void of spacem and since the meaning is the dharmadhātu of Samantabhadra, it exists without any coalescence or separation in any of the three times. No head or tail can be seen here, no limbs are shown here, in terms of time, here it abides without abiding. Without grasping to any extremes -- Buddhas and sentient beings are in that. The dharmakāya, the sambhogakāya, and the nirmanakāya, the emanations of the body, speech, mind, qualities and activities of the Victors, male, female, neuters, moving and resting and so on -- that superior one is called the "abiding tortoise"
Second, the tortoise of formation: the seven water maṇḍalas come from the moist breath of the abiding tortoise and from the mouth of the tortoise formes a green maṇḍala of water. Above that, from the flesh of the tortoise form Meru, the oceans and major and minor continents and the golden firmament. The pores of the tortoise form as grass and trees. That is the description of the tortoise of formation.
The golden tortoise of existence is the tortoise of existence that comes from the meeting of the tortoise of abiding and the tortoise of formation. The head of the tortoise of existence faces south. The rear-end faces north. The four limbs are in the four intermediate directions. 
From its white carapace, Grandfather Sky [khen pa rgad bu] formed as heaven. 
Above, the region of the gods arises, the four formless realms, the great god Brahma of the pure abodes and so on. Below that arose the Trāyāstriṁśāḥ gods and the Paranirmitavaśavartino gods on the top of Meru. On the slopes of Meru arose the four great king gods, the sun, the moon and all of the planets and stars. 
The sun and moon arose from the eyes of the tortoise, and the sound of thunder came from the sound of his palate. Lightning flashes from his extended tongue produced thunder bolts and hail. 
Wind came from the breath of the tortoise, the five external elements came from his five functional organs. 
Earthquakes were caused by the movements of the tortoise’s body. The golden belly of the tortoise formed or arose from Grandmother Earth [khon ma rgan mo] as the ground. And from that region of the nāgās, the eight wild nāgās and so on, arose.
Furthermore, that tortoise of existence is divided into two, method and wisdom or male and female. The golden tortoise of mentation is equal with space, the nature of method, and face down. The silver tortoise of phenomenal objects is equal with the surface of the world, is the nature of wisdom and lays on its back and so on, as it is in the many methods of explanation.

This is a very huge polemical area in Tibetan Buddhism, but in general, Nyingmas, Sakyapas and Kagyupas hold that a Buddha's actions, whether verbal or physical are completely spontaneous and free from conceptuality and cognition of conventional signs.

As we gather together in solidarity to express a feeling of mass injustice, we must not lose sight of what brought us together. We write so that all people who feel wronged by the corporate forces of the world can know that we are your allies.

As one people, united, we acknowledge the reality: that the future of the human race requires the cooperation of its members; that our system must protect our rights, and upon corruption of that system, it is up to the individuals to protect their own rights, and those of their neighbors; that a democratic government derives its just power from the people, but corporations do not seek consent to extract wealth from the people and the Earth; and that no true democracy is attainable when the process is determined by economic power. We come to you at a time when corporations, which place profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments. We have peaceably assembled here, as is our right, to let these facts be known.

They have taken our houses through an illegal foreclosure process, despite not having the original mortgage.

They have taken bailouts from taxpayers with impunity, and continue to give Executives exorbitant bonuses.

They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one’s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.

They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.

They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless animals, and actively hide these practices.

They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.

They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.

They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers’ healthcare and pay.

They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.

They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.

They have sold our privacy as a commodity.

They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press. They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.

They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.

They have donated large sums of money to politicians, who are responsible for regulating them.

They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.

They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save people’s lives or provide relief in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantial profit.

They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.

They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.

They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.

They have perpetuated colonialism at home and abroad. They have participated in the torture and murder of innocent civilians overseas.

They continue to create weapons of mass destruction in order to receive government contracts. *

To the people of the world,

We, the New York City General Assembly occupying Wall Street in Liberty Square, urge you to assert your power.

Exercise your right to peaceably assemble; occupy public space; create a process to address the problems we face, and generate solutions accessible to everyone.

Kevin Solway, you should understand that there are two models of DO. The twelve links are the specific theory of DO applied to the process of samsara. It is derived from the general theory of DO, "Where this exists, that exists..." and so on. 

The specific theory of DO also has four variations, serial, static, momentary and simultaneous. 

Now, since the Buddha admonished Ananda for thinking DO was an easy read -- what are we to make of your claim to have "understood" it before encountering Buddhism?

In reality, DO is profound and subtle. DO is also one of those things that when we first read it, we all say, "wow, I already get that." But that does not mean we really understand DO. It merely means we recognize the concept to be true.

Tibetan astrology (skar rtsi) is tropical, since the Kalacakra is based on a tropical zodiac, unlike Jyotish, which is based on a sidereal zodiac. Incidentally, Kalacakra sets out to correct the calculations of Surya Siddhanta. 

Elemental calculation ('byung rtsi or nag rtsi), often miscalled " Tibetan astrology", has nothing to do with horoscopy, and so on, so the Zodiac, tropical or sidereal, is perfectly irrelevent. It is based on the five elements i.e. wood, fire, earth, metal and water; the twelve years, tiger and so on; the eight trigrams (spar kha); what we call the magic square of saturn and its nine versions (sme ba).

But in Dzogchen the primary comittment is to recognizing and then maintaining knowledge of your actual state. So to begin with, you should be trying to discover what that is. This is the point of all Dharma. So on this point, all Dharma teachings have the same comittment. In Dzogchen the method of trying to discover what your actual state is begins with introduction. In Vajrayana, it begins with receiving some kind of empowerment, in Hinayana and Mahayana, it begins with receiving some kind of vows.

Remember, he states "Since the Jinas have proclaimed nirvana alone is true, what wise person would not understand the rest is false?"

The two truths, are for Nāgārjuna merely a pragmatic methodology used by Buddhas to lead sentient beings from delusion to non-delusion. But they are not a philosophical system, at least, not for Nagarjuna and Aryadeva. In other words, if anything, the two truths are a pedagogical method, and that is all.

Candrakirti very specificially says "yang dag mthong yul gang de de nyid de" i.e. "Any object [yul] of a correct (yang dag) perception (mthong) that is real (de nyid)" i.e. an ultimate truth. The he says mthong ba brdzun pa kun rdzob bden par gsungs i.e. "[The object of] a false perception is a relative truth." 

He also specfies very precisely just before these two lines:

/dngos kun yang dag brdzun pa mthong ba yis/ /dngos rnyed ngo bo gnyis ni 'dzin par 'gyur

"Since all things are perceived correctly and falsely;
all things will possess two natures. 

He then explains in his commenatary:

de'i phyir dngos po thams cad rang bzhin de gnyis 'dzin pa yin no/ /rang bzhin de gnyis las kyang mthong ba yang dag pa'i yul gang yin pa de ni de nyid de/ de ni don dam pa'i bden pa'o zhes bya ba'i don to/ /de'i rang gi ngo bo ni bshad par bya'o/ /mthong ba brdzun pa'i yul gang yin pa de ni kun rdzob kyi bden pa'o/ /de'i phyir de ltar bden pa gnyis rnam par gzhag nas/ mthong ba brdzun pa rnams la mthong ba yang dag pa dang brdzun pa nyid las 

Therefore, all things possess two natures. Also out of those two natures, any object of a correct perception means that it is called "ultimate truth". It's own nature has been explained. Any object of a false perception is a relative truth. Therefore, after having demonstrated the two truths, among false perceptions there are also true and false."

No, Tsongkhapa was a good yogi, and had experience. He received the transmissions of the tantras, practiced them, was skilled in the arts of Vajramaster, and conveyed them properly, he was am interesting and novel scholar. However, it is precisely his novelty that landed him in hot water with those who were not his students. 

In this instance, his students had lots of faith in him and thus there is a new lineage. Those who were not his students rather resented the Sakya sarmas as they were called for a while, these new Sakyapas later known as Gelugpas. 

So while we all respect Tsongkhapa, we do not all assume that he achieved awakening.

No workstation mac has ever been hacked. Macs that have been hacked are webservers, and only because they are running some kind of webserver with outdated code. But the OS itself is very bullet proof unless you download something on purpose and install it, like mac defender.

Agreed, a negation does not entail possession of a view. According to Rongzom, so called non-affirming negation is used to reject an opponents POV. The affirming negation is used to prove one's own view. According to him, Madhyamalas only use the former and never the latter in reference to reality. He also points out that they accept the consequence that their own position is harmed i.e. they do not maintain a position but purely maintain a critical stance. 

But right from the beginning there was rebellion against this, for example, the harsh criticism of Candrakirti found in the colophon of the translation of Ratnakarashanti's Madhyamakalamkara.

Ok, you are not understanding something -- kiun rdzob is relative truth, but actually means "totally obscuring" in Tibetan. 

But false perception is mthong brdzun, so what Candrakirti is clearly saying is that false/faulty/incorrect perception is relative, or totally obscuring, truth. 

The two truths are about how objects are perceived. They can be perceived in only two ways, correctly and incorrectly. Perceiving them incorrectly, a false perception of them is called relative truth. The word brdzun pa means "to lie" as well. Further, for example, there are two schools in Yogacara rnam bden pa and rnam brdzun pa i.e. true aspect and false aspect. The latter is the higher of the two. The term brdzun pa means false.

So a false perception is relative truth. 

When Shantideva is taking about the two truths, he says - ultimate truth is beyond the mind, because the mind itself is relative. The mind can never apprehend ultimate truth.

Not attacking anyone, merely pointing out that there are differences in views. 

In this case, it is better for people to follow the advice of their individual teacher, rather than a teacher in a book. Every teacher has a different teaching because people are different and need different things. But if someone falls into Dozghen Community, then it is better they heed ChNN's instructions -- the same goes for everyone else.

MMK refutes both:

"Where is there an existent not included in inherent existence or dependent existence? 
If an existent is not established, a non-existent is not established.
Those who perceive existents, non-existents,
inherent existence or dependent existence do not see the truth of the Buddha's teaching."

Madhyamaka therefore do not assert any views. Not asserting a view does not mean "incapable of engaging in conventional discourse", something you gelugpas seem to be afraid of.

Those of us who follow ChNN follow what ChNN has to say. In this case, he says buy meat from markets, as many kinds as possible, sausage is better since it is made from the meat of many animals. When used in a ganapuja, it creates a cause for that animal's liberation. 

Wine should be consumed in a mindful manner. 

When you follow ChNN you follow the system of Dzogchen as he teaches it, since he is the only teacher that I know for a fact is a realized Dzogchen master. I am sure there are others, but I do not know that for a fact nor who they are. But I know ChNN is an awakened person and this is not because of my faith. This is because he has described his experience openly to a large extent. So I am certain he is an awakened person, beyond any doubt whatsoever.

The first principle is: anyone who thinks of being a teacher, must first understand there are many teachers superior to him or herself. So in this case, better to send prospective students to one's own or another teacher. 

If in the end it turns out that someone really cannot enter the dharma without your help, then and only then is it really necessary for you to act as a teacher. Then it does not become an ego trip. 

But even in this case, if you do not have sufficient knowledge, understanding and pratical experience, you really cannot help others, you will only harm them. 

In this case, it is better not to teach, even if there are no other teachers available.

Contact at the eye is to be abandoned. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is to be abandoned.

"The ear is to be abandoned. Sounds are to be abandoned...

"The nose is to be abandoned. Aromas are to be abandoned...

"The tongue is to be abandoned. Flavors are to be abandoned...

"The body is to be abandoned. Tactile sensations are to be abandoned...

"The intellect is to be abandoned. Ideas are to be abandoned. Consciousness at the intellect is to be abandoned. Contact at the intellect is to be abandoned. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is to be abandoned.

NO, this is false. 

Budget for 2011
$2.627 trillion (estimated) [1]

Total expenditures	$3.729 trillion

There is a 1.101 trillion dollar deficit. 

So, lets say we look at the numbers:

$553.0 billion (+0.7%) - Department of Defense
$118.0 billion (-26.0%) - Overseas Contingency Operations

Right there, you have 671 Billion. That is more than half of the deficit. All that military entitlement spending. 

Medicare and Medicaid combined is like 754 Billion. 

So, like most Rebuplicans, you want to keep the army and spend more money on it, but strip people of already inadequate health care. 

SSI brings in $925 billion - Social Security and other payroll tax

Looks to be like SSI pays for itself pretty damn well. Nothing socialist there. 

The simplest thing to do, to pay for the whole thing is redistribute some wealth from the %1. Yes, raise taxes of rich people, since they are not creating an goddamned job and are just bloodsuckers, capitalist leeches.

My view of neo=-liberalism is that WTO type agreements have basically caught everyone in a neo-liberal free trade nightmare. Look at all the so alled "austerity" measures being enforced by banks on this and that country. International capital has become a more powerful force than national governments, which is the whole point and goal of the neo-liberal agenda from the beginning i.e. less regulation, more market transparency, weaker unions, more profits, etc.

I think neo-liberalism is more powerful than ever, not weaker.

The Buddha accepts requests from samsaric beings, as in this case. By definition, any being defined as a deva is samsaric since they belong to the three realms. It is not possible for brahmas to enter the Buddhist path, actually. The path of awakening is open only to human beings. While it is true that there are devas who are arhats, they must have become stream enterers, once-returners or never returners as human beings in their previous births. It is no where indicated that this brahma was in fact an arya.

No, Kevin, you are clearly mistaken on this point. 

"Then Brahma Sahampati, having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness, thought: "The world is lost! The world is destroyed! The mind of the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Rightly Self-awakened One inclines to dwelling at ease, not to teaching the Dhamma!" Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahma-world and reappeared in front of the Blessed One. Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, he knelt down with his right knee on the ground, saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart, and said to him: "Lord, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the One-Well-Gone teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma."

This Brahma is not the so called "ancestor Brahma". In fact there are many Brahmas, since brahma is a class of deva, and not a single deva. This brahma is just a brahma in the brahmaloka. 

So you are conflating these things a bit. It can be a bit confusing, I know, but patience and attention to detail is required to properly understand Buddhism and its context within Indian religion as a whole.

The debt situation of each of these three countries is completley different and independent.

The Spanis debt crisis was caused by a building bubble that collpased -- basically, very similar to the US. 

The Greek debt Crisis was caused by running large deficits, which caused their bonds to give yeilds as high as %15 (meaning they are very risky). 

The Italian debt crisis is being caused by rising yeilds on italian bonds, which means that borrowing costs for the Italian goverment is rising too high to make it easy for them to borrow. Typically, when bond yields rise above %7 they become riskier. This is not happening because the Italians want this to happen, it is happening because of poorly regulated financial markets putting pressure on the price of Italian debt. 

US exposure to all of this debt comes in the form of CDS -- invented by Wall Street. 

It is time for the Euro to go.

Credit Default Swaps were invented by Wall Street financial wizards. The reason we are exposed to the Greek debt crisis is because of derivatives we created in order to invest in debt. So please, don't give me a bunch of nonsense about how Greek Socialisms is destroying the American economy.

The main point of anuyoga is not rtsa rlung, since mahāyoga also possesses rtsa rlung as part of the completion stage. 

The main point of difference between anuyoga and mahāyoga is view; the view ofthe basis in anuyoga dzogchen, from the beginning. For this reason there is no summoning of the wisdom being, or if there is, it is stated as a something like the commitment being and wisdom being have always been inseparable. Second, based on this, the method of creation is instant rather than gradual. That latter point is the most important difference between mahā and anu.

It supports what you say solely from a Nyingma POV. But Nyingma is not the end all and be all of Vajrayāna. Sarma schools have a different POV, especially Sakya and Gelug. So you need to qualify your statements.

As to Anuyoga, what you practice is mostly anuyoga. Most termas are anuyoga. 

You need to be able to differentiate what you have been taught from the approach of other schools. Your reading is top down. Since your teachers are all Dzogchen practitioners, it is natural that Dzogchen colors everything they teach. 

Guhyagarbha is classified as ati of mahāyoga, actually.

Hi Magnus:

Actually, in gsar ma schools that is exactly what creation stage means -- if you imagine it is a mandala, it becomes a mandala. This is why it is called "path of transformation". We are transforming our impure vision into a pure vision. We do this to undermine our tendency to engage in afflictive attachments. If we see everything as pure, we will have less grasping. The creation stage is conceptual, not non-coneotual. The completion stage is used to cut attachment to conceptuality of the creation stage. Eventually, we are supposed to unify creation and completion so that we are in the state of the union of illusory body and luminosity aka mahāmudra. 

This is partially why one finds criticisms of the two stages approach even in Mahāmudra upadeshas. 

Guhyagarbha contains the view of Dzogchen, this is why the thirteenth chapter of Guhyagarbha emphasizes that the mandala has always been naturally formed [ye nas lhun grub] . So it is a very different approach. It is not really the approach of the two stages. 

You are so conditioned by Anuyoga, you have a hard time relating to mahāyoga in and of itself.

I don't think Senge Wangchuk was that involved with deity yoga -- there is no evidence that he emphasized it at all. I am sure he knew it, however. Aro Yeshe either.

It is not a debate. It is plain difference of style. Magnus is very Nyingma in his approach, based on his tradition and teachers. Magnus' idea is that ChNN students do not understand something important. 

Personally, I think ChNN is the greatest master of Dzogchen alive. Just read my post on atikosha.org about him. But that is me. 

Other people who follow other masters should feel their master and his or her approach is the best. Those of us who follow ChNN need to respect other masters and their students -- we should not get into some trip about this tradition or that tradition. Often these days ChNN is fond of saying that there is no "dzogchen tradition". 

We need to strive for mutual respect. That is important.

Face it Magnus, people in the DC are _never_ going to agree that they have to do ngondro, creation stage, completion stage, etc., since our master says that the tantric approach to these things is not our approach and are not necessary. This is not the path that ChNN has laid for us. 

As you well know, our master, ChNN says the only necessary thing for his students is Guru Yoga of White A. On the other hand, he also says that since people have many conditions and circumstances, they should not limit themselves, and this is why he provides methods such as tara, mandarava, namkha, serkyem, chulen, yantra, etc.

But if you are not an SMS student, then you are free to do what you like. Not everyone is in SMS. 

In General, ChNN prefers people to understand their primordial state and to do Guru Yoga (which are the same thing). This, he feels, is much superior to any of the other uncommon preliminaries. So basically, he prefers people to skip over the other uncommon preliminaries and to make Guru Yoga their main practice until they have real knowledge (rig pa) of their primordial state. For example, he considers purification of the five elements better than Vajrasattva. And if you are going to do Vajrasattva, one week is sufficient, etc.

Many years ago, in 1992, ChNN advised us not to look at thogal texts prior to receiving total instructions.

They should wait until ChNN or some other qualified master can bestow the teaching on them in a proper way.

My point about availability is a little different, however. I feel the text classical texts should be available, since to a large extent they are self-secret. But this does not mean people should just go ahead and read them without having had the instruction from a qualified teacher. If they do, there is a good chance they will create obstacles for their practice. So people should be mature.

For all interested people:

ChNN is giving a wonderful teaching on tögal. He even permitted people to come who have never before received teachings or transmission. Anyone who asked him was allowed to come or so I understand.  There are 1100 people in attendance from all over the world. This is probably that largest single group of people outside of Tibet to receive tögal teachings at one time. 

There was no empowerment. Rinpoche did only the very simplest of introductions during the first session and has spent the last three days explaining how to do this practice very thoroughly through all four visions, how to recognize them, how to develop them and the signs of attaining each one.

Namo Guru Bhyah!

He also explained very carefully why and how Dzogchen is a separate vehicle; how and why it is also related to Vajrayāna; and how and why Dzogchen does not need to depend on the methods common to Vajrayāna. He also explained why people should not be averse to the methods of Vajrayāna and why they are useful and important. All in all a balanced presentation. 

He also clearly explained the principle of rainbow body and great transference body similarities and differences.

Tenerife is awesome.

Content:
In Tibetan Medicine the spleen is the spleen, located on the left side of the body, above the pancreas. These are the types of spleen illnesses we identify explicitly as "spleen" illnesses: hot spleen illness, blood bloating, wind spleen, phlegm spleen, and swollen.

Weak stomach heat i.e. jaṭaragni is not related to the spleen itself in either Tibetan Medicine or Ayurveda. However, your intuition is good. 

It seems that in Chinese medicine the spleen means the liver, and the liver means the spleen. The liver is indeed responsible for transformation and nourishing blood and muscles in Tibean Medicine. So in my opinion when Chinese medicine is talking about spleen deficiencies we would understand this as a problem with the liver's ability to process nutrients. Our approach would be to restore liver heat, and then one can eat whatever one likes without avoiding anything. The possible approach to this would be to do a round of Pancakarma or failing that, a seasonal cleanse to remove lymphatic blockages, cleanse the biliary pathways, and cleanse the intestines of excess mucous which is blocking the uptake of nutrients in general. 

This is essentially a cold liver disease from a Tibetan Medical POV.

The difference between modern pharmaceuticals and Tibetan and Ayurvedic formulas (as well as Chinese formulas) is that the former have no track record and are relatively recent. The latter have been tested on human popluations for 1000 years+ and their effects, dosages, indications, and counter-indications are well known and described. 

The caveat is that herbal medicines, like their allopathic counterpart, require a) a medical theory which underlies a nosology b) a clinically experienced doctor trained in that field of medicine.

I personally have no confidence in the efficacy of homeopathic formulas. But they are also not harmful. So if people want to spend their money on them, I have no problem with it.

Well, it is not likely. Why?  Because we have on hand Sakya Pandita text on how to pronounce mantras, and he was student of various panditas from various parts of India, and his uncle and grandfather were all fluent in Sanskrit.  

Tibetan pronunciation of mantras can be accounted for very easily. Most Tibetans did not know Sanskrit, and pronounced mantras in texts phonetically as they saw them, rather than as they were intended, for example pronouncing ཛ་ as dza rather than ja, which is what was intended, or  pronouncing ཙི་ཏཏ་as tsitta rather than citta. 

We do the same thing to Tibetan. I know many people in Dzogchen Community who still pronounce the o in dzog as in dog, rather than as in oak. Or people who pronounce prajna as if the j were to pronounced as in ajax, rather than a gñ complex.

We're doomed:

How bad could it get? A recent study by MIT projects that without "rapid and massive action" to cut carbon pollution, the Earth's temperature could soar by nine degrees this century. "There are no analogies in human history for a temperature jump of that size in such a short time period," says Tony McMichael, an epidemiologist at Australian National University. The few times in human history when temperatures fell by seven degrees, he points out, the sudden shift likely triggered a bubonic plague in Europe, caused the abrupt collapse of the Moche civilization in Peru and reduced the entire human race to as few as 1,000 breeding pairs after a volcanic eruption blocked out the sun some 73,000 years ago. "We think that because we are a technologically sophisticated society, we are less vulnerable to these kinds of dramatic shifts in climate," McMichael says. "But in some ways, because of the interconnectedness of our world, we are more vulnerable."

Then, the free arising of appearances having understood the appearances of wisdom is seen to be like a cloud of Dharma, mounting the tenth stage, Clouds Of Dharma. That is the resting place of those persons who have seen the truth, without giving this up they mount the stage. 

Means that in these schemata, this tenth stage is only equivalent to Mahāyāna first bhumi. In the rig pa rang shar scheme, bhumis 1--9 are equivalent to the common Mahāyāna path of accumulation and application. Bhumis 10-16 are equivalent to the Mahāyana path of seeing, cultivation and so on.

You see, that wisdom of vidyā, which is your basis neither increases nor decreases, hence it is said in many Dzogchen texts, there is no path, no stages, etc. On the other hand, our knowledge of that wisdom is either lacking or partial, and thus we can speak of stages, paths and practices. 

Basically, you folks are having an non-argument (after pages and pages) because in Dzogchen both perspectives, gradual and non-gradual, are equally true for everyone at the same time.

WE are talking about the same thing. It is just a name for the experiencing of recognizing rigpa for real. What TNR is talkign about is not realization of the first bhumi. He is basing his presentation on this discussion about togal visions.

It is very simple, actually. The first vision, since that is what is being discussed, resembles the first bhumi because you are observing an actual sign of your vidyā. This is why it is termed personal experience of dharmatā. Since the thigles and so on are your actual state, you are observing, with your eyes, your real nature, or rather it's sign projected into space. 

This must be introduced to you in the rig pa''i rtsal dbang. You will not understand it otherwise, as you know.

This is a novel interpretation. I have read many thousands of pages of Dzogchen texts in Tibetan and I have yet to see any of them say this. That being said, of course there is an important connection between thogal and the bardo. Doing thogal makes it easier to recognize the bardo of dharmatā, its sound, lights and rays.

The greatest ongoing cost of building a sustaintable community is not land, it is labor. Combine that with the rising costs of fuel, and you have a combination that makes it very hard to succeed in building an intentional community. 

What we are basically talking about is switching back to a nineteenth century economy (localized) where wood is your primary energy source, supplemented by oil, with human and animal labor as your primary labor force. In order to make this community work, you will have become largely proficient in providing the majority of your own food. This means convertible husbandry.  Thus, you will need to build a manure factory. If you have 30 acres of arable land, you will need to maintain a herd of fifteen cows (one cow produces enough manure every year to fertilize two acres), manure ponds, etc. In other words, you will need to become an expert in composting manure. You will need to do this to maintain the fertility and health of your land. You will need to learn (if you don't already know) how best to can, preserve and otherwise maintain your summer and fall harvests for the winter, as well as feed your animals through the winter. And you will need a lot of committed people who are willing to live on just food and lodging to help you out in the howling wilderness we call "post-industrial" civlization. Most communes, or whatever you want to call it, fail because they do not adequately understand how to farm. In short, if you really want to make this work, you will have to become a farmer. 

Good luck! Really, I mean it.

Nidhi means treasure in Sanskrit. The standard Nyingma reply to anti-terma polemics is to point out that all Indian Mahāyāna and Varjayāna literature is also recovered from treasures troves.

E-sangha was hacked by tamil tiger hackers who were pissed at a debate about Sinhalese nationalism occuring on E-Sangha at the time-- then the hosting company pooched the backup when the database was corrupted. All very straightforward and nothing mysterious. 

For the most part, all the other successful Buddhist boards are running under modified sets of rules developed out of their experience at e-Sangha. 

E-Sangha, for the most part, failed because it tried to satisfy the competing values of three major Buddhist traditions, Thervada, Zen and Tibetan Buddhism. Now there are three boards, with three different sets of former E-Sangha moderators in these three spheres. And they all have policies more or less derived from E-Sangha with modifications made according to their own experience.

Wasn't me. I don't flame peope either. Not for incorrect opinions. If you were banned, it was by someone else. I never banned anyone for simply disagreeing with an opinion of mine. In fact, I banned very few people. People who persisted in signing in under multiple user names, who tried to get around suspensions, and so yes, but never for disagreeing with something I said. So you are mistaken. Also, when I banned someone, I always let them know why. If you did not receive an email from me informing you of why you were being banned, then I did not do it. I cannot speak for other moderators.

I could really care less about what Sakya Pandita or Gorampa thought of Nyingma Tantras. Sarma tantras are on no more a solid footing that Nyingma tantras. The issue of Indian vs. Tibean authorship is a non-starter.

This is just Sarma propaganda. So called tantras that were causing people to "practice wrongly" were such tantras as Guhyagarbha, Vajrakilaya, and so on. Gorampa identifies the kun byed rgyal po as a "fake" and so on. 

But who cares? Really, this is just bullshit. 

All it is one group of people who were mad that Tibetan termas were competing with Indian nidhi (treasures).
