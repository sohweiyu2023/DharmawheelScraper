Thubten's lack of familiarity with the Lotus Sūtra is normal. However the assumptions of the one yāna teaching presented in the Lotus Sūtra is very much present in Tibetan Buddhism, explicitly based on that sūtra. 

The reason why such a monk might be surprised by such a teaching has to do with the fact that for the most part Tibetan and Indian Buddhist scholars tended to rely on commentaries; whereas Chinese Buddhists preferred to rely on sūtras directly. Since the latter did so, various forms of Buddhism arose unique to China, with assumptions about Dharma Indians, and later Tibetans, apparently never would hold.

Several buddhas have appeared in this world to teach us, and many more will appear (another 997). 

Buddhas are not restricted by time and space. Buddhas also do not "reach out." Their compassion is spontaneous, like a wishfulfilling gem that satisfies all wishes. 

This Sahaloka is an impure buddhafield because the experience of the various sufferings of this world system are unthinkable. Of course the Buddha was kind to prepare this buddhafield, but don't kid yourself into thinking there aren't better places to be.

But more importantly, Śākyamuni passed into parinirvana and is not physically present on this planet, other than some bones, ash, and teeth of questionable provenance, and the next Buddha will be Maitreya. So it is written, so shall it be.

It has to do with the difference between the Tibetan translation and the Sanskrit original. The Tibetan term is rung ba, which means suitable, proper, but also possible, in the sense of one can do this or that. The Sanskrit term here is more restrictive. The first time I wrote down the quote, I wrote it down hastily based on my memory of the Tibetan verse; but Sherab is correcet, if everything were possible because of emptiness, then buddhahood could revert, etc., corn could become wheat, and that is not what the verse intends. So i went back to the Sanskrit and looked at Buddhapalita's commentary for clarification.

But this is quite a different use than what you originally advanced: self, no self, both, and neither. 

Anyway, it really should be:

8. Everything is true, false, 
both true and false,
and neither true nor false. 
This is Lord Buddha’s teaching.

However, the traditional understanding is that the first term, "everything is true and false," means that the Buddha follows mundane convention and proclaims it to be true. If something is not true according to worldly convention, the Buddha proclaims it to be false. If the world says that something is both true and false, also the Buddha agrees. And if the world says something is neither true nor false, again Buddha agrees. 

Buddhapalita then uses the example of pictures on a wall. Let's use the Buddha. There is a picture on the wall of Buddha, so we agree it is Buddha. But it is false if one says this is the real Buddha. It is both true and false in that it is true it is picture and it is false in that it is not the real Buddha. It is not a real buddha, hence not true,  but it is also not not a representation of someone other than Buddha, hence not false. This is the sense in which that statement should be understood.

Purification practices removes the conditions for the ripening of the traces of negative karma and improve the conditions for the ripening of traces of conducive karma. Why? Because confession of misdeeds blunts their ripening because the strength of a given misdeed is related to object, intention, the deed, and satisfaction. The expression of regret for negative actions committed in the past counters the strength of intent and satisfaction. If these two are sufficiently weakened, a negative karma may never ripen.

As to your second statement, this merely proves my point. Buddhas are powerless to help sentient beings in any kind of material way. What Buddhas can do is teach the Dharma. That is all they need to do.

Bodhisattvas like Tāra, etc., have continuums. But they really cannot do anything to help sentient beings. If they could, they would act without bias for all sentient beings, without respect to their beliefs or merit, and we would not be living in such trying conditions. 

All they can do is teach. That is all Buddhas and bodhisattvas can really do to help sentient beings. It is well known that when one does wealth practice for example, one is using up ones own merit of wealth in the process unless one very carefully dedicates one's practice to make the merit of practice inexhaustible.

I am afraid I find your view very theistic, it seems to me you think of Tāra the same way Catholics think of saints.

The Buddha has said very clearly, one cannot wash away misdeeds, he cannot remove suffering with his hand, he cannot give one liberation, but he can teach. 

So then, what is the use of praying to Buddhas and bodhisattvas, apart from accumulating merit? 

Further, if Tāra represents the state of Dzogchen, whose state is that? 

If, in a thogal vision, some master reveals a treasure, from where is that treasure revealed?

Right, and according to conventional expression, 1) the awakening of the buddha does not exist 2) the illusory appearances of buddhas are false appearances for deluded sentient beings

Somehow you are committed to the idea of conventionally valid, external rūpakāyas hanging around to benefit beings. My point is that you are reifying buddhas and sentient beings as existents, rather that seeing them for what they are, illusions. Once one understands everything is absolutely equivalent to an illusion, one's anxiety about such matters begins to diminish.

There is no canonical basis for the idea of reincarnations of body, speech, mind, etc. 

That said, there is canonical basis for bodhisattvas having exponentially more emanations from the first bhumi one ward which increase by powers of ten, thus a tenth stage bodhisattva can have 100,000,000,000,000,000,000, i.e. one hundred septillion emanations. 

And every Buddha has an emanation in every world in a given billion-world universe (1000 to the third power).

It is a completely wrong view. 

The Buddhist teaching about such things is that every sentient being, mosquitos included, has a unique mind stream with its own set of causes and conditions, it's own accumulation of karma and ripening of karma. 

With respect to the term bla, today it means more or less vitality. In ancient pre-buddhist traditions in Tibet, it is a rather complicated subject; commonly however today in the Buddhist context, bla is understood to be synonym for consciousness (Tibetan Medicine) or an alternate term for lifeforce. So called "soul retrieval" (bla 'gugs) rites are in reality little more than rites for summoning the vitality of the five elements to reinforce one's own five elements. 

There is also a medical condition called bla 'khyams,  "wandering bla," which is diagnosed in people who exhibit dissociative disorders, especially from trauma. There is also the idea that provocations, spirits, can steal one's bla, which results in a kind of wasting disease.  

With respect to the idea of an awakened master transferring their "mind" (thugs) to a disciple, this is a form of blessing. It does not mean that now the student has all the teachers thoughts and knowledge, memories, experiences, and so on.

His opinion is that modern Bon, so called Yungdrung Bon, is structured on the basis of Buddhism and is for the most part wholly derivative of Buddhism, apart from obviously autochthonic concepts and practice such as Sang, Lungta, etc. We can see this in Ye khrid mtha' sel, for example, which presents a Bon version of Naro Khachodma complete with a version of the triple OM mantra.

The colophon of the Tibetan is pretty clear, the commentary was written by a Sinhalese ācārya named Prthivibandhu, but this does not a) bar him from having written the commentary in China, b) does not bar him from having been a student of Xuanzang, and c) does not bar him from being privy to debates about Mahāyāna sūtras and their Indian interpretation because a) being Sinhalese does not bar one from traveling to India or China and b) does not bar one from having a Chinese Buddhist teacher. 

Further, the fact that Tibetan text is shorter than its Chinese sister could very well mean that the Chinese commentary was amended with further chapters after the text was translated into Tibetan, either from Sanskrti or Chinese. There is no indication in the Tibetan colophon of the Dege edition as to whether it was translated from Sanskrit or Chinese.

The Ghanavyūha Sūtrastates:

The buddhas abiding in that place
praise Ghanavyūha.
Ghanavyūha has existed from beginningless time.
A self-originated emanation is there,
the stainless Buddha. 
Dwelling beyond the three elements (fire, air, and water),
that place is without grasping to bliss,
it is free from the experience of I and mine,
it is unchanging, ultimately permanent, and stable. 
Ghanavyūha is unconditioned. 
The perfect buddhas awaken [there]
but without buddhahood in the supreme place, Akaniṣṭha,
the deeds of the buddha will not be performed in the desire realm. 
Once they depart Ghanavyūha 
ten million emanations of the Buddha
will always remain in yogic equipoise. 

And:

The Ghanavyūha buddhafield exists beyond the subtle particle nature of the other buddhafields. The Ghanavyūha buddhafield is without the sun, planets, and the moon. Because it’s nature is unconditioned, it does not appear as the most subtle of subtle particles. 

Thus the Buddha teaches that all buddhas attain buddhahood in Ghanavyūha.

And, it is really not a place within time or space:

When consciousness transforms,
it is Ghanavyūha free from mind. 
It is not the domain of those with concepts.
The palace of the Tathāgata, Ghanavyūha,
did not arise in the past and has no end;
it is arises from the power of natural perfection;
without a cause, does not arise from karma;
it is not created by Iśvara;
it exists truly beyond
the desire, form, and formless realms. 
As it is beyond the desire realm,
beyond the form realm, the formless realm,
the unconscious beings, and the cause of darkness—
this beautiful Ghanavyūha buddhafield
formed from space,
is not the domain of those with causes,
free from existence and nonexistence,
free from sameness and difference.

Not all Buddhists are followers of Buddhadharma. Many millions of "Buddhists" are culturally "Buddhist" with no understanding of Buddhadharma. Only some so-called "Buddhists" are followers of Buddhadharma. 

Those who have taken the bodhisattva vow are motivated by Mahāyāna bodhicitta. Otherwise they would not have not taken the vow. And lest, for example you complain that some people may take it without meaning it, the Surangama Samadhi Sūtra teaches that Māra tried to the deceive the Buddha by taking the bodhisattva vow; but guess what— even if one takes the bodhisattva vow with the intent to deceive, it still has such force that even Papayin Māra received a prediction for full buddhahood. 

There are many people who practice Hinayāna who have no interest in Mahāyāna. But they too are generally motivated by love and compassion.

This is a mistaken belief. There is no possibility tīrthikas (who are specifically what we term Hindus, actually), much less other nonBuddhists faiths gather the so called merit and wisdom accumulations. 

If they practice the four immeasurables, love, compassion, etc., as well as avoid non-virtue, they will remain in higher realms, depending on their past karma. 

However, the merit accumulation depends on having developed bodhicitta (the motivation to become a buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings). When one dedicates one's merit free from the three wheels, it becomes inexhaustible. This is the only way to gather the merit accumulation. Otherwise, one always spends whatever merit one has, eventually, and winds up in lower realms. There is no need to even discuss the wisdom accumulation.

CTR was trying to help people with no experience of Vajrayāna during the seminaries from 1973-1980 gain a (very) gross approximation of Vajrayāna view by using examples from European intellectual history. Taking him literally on this point is mistaken. When reading CTR's books, all edited from f-bombs filled transcripts into smooth prose, we have to understand too that he was doing acid and smoking pot with his students because he was trying to relate to them at their level.

My comment is based on Prthvibandhu's commentary. This is how the sūtra was commonly understood by Indian exegetes. In other words, Śakyamuni, in this sūtra, is attributing to himself the qualities of a sambhogakāya which are commonly understood to the audience of bodhisattvas. Since only eighth through tenth stage bodhisattva are privileged to see the Sambhogakāya in Akaniṣṭha, he is in this passage making a statement about the inseparability of the three kāyas. Further, to understand this passage in question, one must also understand it in reference to the statement about the purity of the Sahaloka in the Vimalakirti-nirdesa sūtra. 

There are many ways to unpack a sūtra's meaning —&nbsp;the literal meaning of the words is generally the least useful and interesting. 

The text does not "resist" conformity, as you put it. The idea of the three wheels, for example, or that sūtras are to be understood in light of when in Buddha's career he supposedly taught them is actually the basis for your entire exegesis of this sūtra —&nbsp;but that idea is also not supported in the sūtra.

If someone has true insight into the nature of phenomena, they will waste their time with the view to the extent that they are trying to communicate the view to others. 

The reason for "wasting one's time" with theories is to eliminate concepts which one may not recognize as being a wrong view or a lower view. 

Buddhadharma, despite some people's knownothingism, is not an anti-intellectual tradition. This should be obvious.

The Prajñāpāramita states:

Whoever wishes to be established in right view, should train in the perfection of wisdom.

Ratnakuta states:

Right view is the abandonment of the view of that the aggregates are a self (satkāyadṛṣti).

The very fact that you put tathāgatagarbha in scare quotes shows that you recognize that it is merely a formal cause, not an efficient cause. 

Mundane right view is necessary for realizing supramundane right view. This is the difference, for example, between the paths of accumulation and application (mundane right view) and the path of seeing (supramundane right view). 

Right view cannot become an object of grasping to a self. It is automatically the recognition of the absence of the self of the person, at minimum. 

Someone who has right view is automatically liberated, in comparison to someone who has wrong view. A person with wrong view will never achieve liberation for as long as they hold wrong views.

Why would there be a sūtra source for practices such as Vajrasattva, Maṇḍala and Guru Yoga? The first comes from Yoga Tantra, and the second two sre found in the Guhyasamaja Tantra. 

The klong gsal 'bar ma nyi ma nyi ma rgyud, revealed by Nyang Ral Nyima Odzer in the late 12th century, explicitly lists the four common foundations, impermanence, death, karma, and suffering of samsara, as well as refuge, bodhicitta, mandala, Vajrasattva, and Guru Yoga. It is almost certain that this pattern of preliminaries dates from this tantra. This tantra itself set the pattern for Nyingma practice up until today.  

With respect to Vajrasattva, it explicitly states it should be recited "Recite this one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand or countless times."

The purusha is a passive knower, deluded into thinking the transformations of the three gunas of pradhana/prakriti— sattva, tamas, and rajas— are distinct as the 24 tattvas — from mahat/buddhi down to the earth element. When a purusha recognizes all of this is nonself, it withdraws from all of it and abides in its own permanent, unique effulgence. There are infinite purushas. 

The criticism of the Saṃkhya system of other yogis, is that not recognizing purusha, they mistake the most subtle form of sattva, i.e., mahat, as the self and rest in that state. But prakriti is not sentient, its sentient appearance is a reflection of the effulgence of purusha. So basically, they assert the nirvana of the Buddhists, for example, is simply resting in unmanifest prakriti, in a state where the three gunas are in stasis. 

Of course we know the Buddhist criticisms of Samkhya are: they assert a permanent self, they assert identity of cause and effect, and they assert prakriti and purusha as real. 

It is important to understand Saṃkhya well, since it is the foundation for all Hindu thought.

So called Neo-Advaita does not go beyond Saṃkhya in many respects. The reason why many people think that Advaita and Dzogchen, etc., are the same is that they do not understand Saṃkhya. All this business about the pure knower, the witness, etc., has its roots in Saṃkhya tenets.

The main difference between standard Advaita and Saṃkhya is that Advaita asserts that when purusha does not recognize its own state, it is saguna Brahman, and that purusha is itself brahman, and there is only one, and third, that the transformations of the three gunas are not real, but are Māya.Therefore, when one recognizes that all the appearances of the 24 tattvas are notself, one recognizes brahman as oneself and one rests in that state.

Actually, he said it was related to the first compassion, compassion with reference to sentient beings. It is a strange statement. It is not worth trying to guess what he meant. I am sure he has a reason for his statement, but he did not articulate it particularly well. 

In sum, there are three kinds of compassion: compassion with reference to sentient beings, compassion with reference to phenomena, and nonreferential compassion. The first is compassion for the suffering of sentient beings; the second is for the impermanence of all phenomena (which of course is the basis of suffering), and the third is meditating on emptiness.

Yes, there are structural similarities, but a similarity does not mean an absolute equivalence. For example, both a pot and cup are structurally similar in that they both have a bottom, a mouth, and are containers, but pots and cups are not the same thing. 

You are taking this notion of no "substantial difference" the wrong way. What I mean is that in Advaita, nirguna brahman is empty of saguna brahmin, it is empty of anything you might call a relative entity. Likewise, in gzhan stong, it is argued that the perfected nature is empty of the two relatives natures. In this way there is a structural similarity between the two systems. But it does not mean, nor did I ever assert that Advaita and gzhan stong were equivalent in every respect. After all, it was my question and I assume I have a better memory of asking it than you do.

No, the three natures are the imputed (parikalpita kun brtags), the dependent (paratantra, gzhan dbang),  and the perfected nature (paraniṣpanna, yongs grub) . 

The way the Tibetans who follow gzhan stong understand things such as Kongtrul, Khyentse Wangpo, and so on understand things — the perfected nature refers to the luminosity of the mind, which is considered to have infinite, ultimate qualities. It does not however refer something apart from the mind. 

Khyentse Wangpo states:

From among the three natures, both the imputed and dependent nature are temporary phenomena, i.e., the intrinsically empty relative. The two aspects of perfected nature are the pristine consciousness of the dharmadhātu, the extrinsically empty ultimate meaning. 

Among the outer, inner, and alternate; the external container universe and the inhabiting sentient beings are the mutable, temporary dharmin, i.e., the intrinsically empty relative. The alternate is the sugatagarbha, the unchanging fundamental dharmatā, i.e., extrinsically empty ultimate meaning. 

In general, among the basis, path, and result, the basis is the sugatagarbha, the pristine consciousness of the all-basis, the basis of the transformation of all samsara and nirvana— 1) the basis of purification of the aspect of faults and 2) the basis of manifesting the aspect of qualities. 

The path is the method of exhausting the aspect of faults in that basis, and the method of manifesting the aspect of qualities, accompanied by the two accumulations. The accumulation of pristine consciousness removes the covering obscuration of the qualities of the dharmakāya that have always existed as naturally perfected from the beginning. The accumulation of merit gradually develops the qualities of the rūpakāya which did not previously exist.

The result is 1) the result of separation, the dharmakaȳa, the ultimate meaning, the suchness kāya, and 2) the generated result, the rūpakāya, the symbolic, relative kāya, which exist as the abundance of one's own benefit and other's benefit.

This is all a discussion of one's own dharmatā, not a soul, nor an overarching universal pleroma.

The term "ultimate reality" does not exist in Buddhist texts. This is a very misleading English gloss. The terms we have for an "ultimate" are 1) ultimate truth, i.e,  paramārtha or don dam, which means "ultimate meaning" or "ultimate sense"; suchness, i.e. tatāta or de bzhin nyid; dharmatā or chos nyid refer to the ultimate essence of relative phenomena. Indeed, these terms, and others like them, are all pointing out something definitive about relative phenomena or beings. 

There are terms in Buddhism that mean "reality," like gnas lugs, bhutatā, but there is no need to add the adjective "ultimate" to such terms because what is real is real. There is no relative reality as opposed to an ultimate reality. The first would be contradiction in terms, since the relative is not real, not constant, not unchanging, etc. The second is redundant since the real is constant, unchanging, etc.

There is no separate unmanifest reality which stands apart from manifest phenomena. This "nonarising" you seek is precisely the nonarising nature of dependently originated phenomena, their emptiness of arising, ceasing, and abiding. 

Emptiness is the quality of things that allows them to undergo change and transformation. 

Nonarising, aka, emptiness is ultimate truth and reality. Emptiness and nonarising are ultimate truths, veridical cognitions arrived at through an analysis of dependently originated phenomena. Emptiness and non-arising are real because they withstand analysis, i.e., they are the result that one finds upon analysis, they are the content of āryan cognition in equipoise. 

But emptiness and nonarising are not ultimate realities because if they were, there would be nothing other than a blank void.

I heard a famous Tibetan recently at a conference assert that we should keep old translation terms, even if they are inaccurate, because they simply have gained the respect of time and usage. It is too soon for such conservatism in my book.

Yes, of course, all Indian schools who propose liberation propose that liberation means freedom from the cycles of birth and death. 

Buddha disagreed with all of these schools completely, and taught it was only through adopting right view, i.e., the four truths of nobles, that one could attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death. 

He taught that they mistook various types of mental states for liberation, mental states which in some cases last millions and millions of years. 

The Bhgavada Gita for example, is an example of an eternalist scripture, and it proposes the best way to achieve liberation is through pure devotion to Krishna as embodiment of Godhead, though it lists other paths as well. 

Saṃkhya is described as an incorrect view because it proposes that causes and effects are merely transformations of one substance. Yoga also suffers from this view. 

Jainism is clearly refuted by the Buddha. This is a no brainer. The Buddha thought that Mahathera was a complete fool. 

Nyaya and Vaishesika did not exist during the time of the Buddha, but their eternalist atomism was soundly negated by later Buddhist scholars such as Bhavaviveka and so on. 

The Mimamsas do not believe in liberation at all, but rather believe in appeasing the gods through rites in order to assure mundane good fortune. 

Advaita also did not exist by name during the time of the Buddha, but it is refuted for proposing that all reality is ultimately one undifferentiated consciousness. 

When one reads the sūtras and tantras taught by the Buddha, one can see very clearly that all these schools are refuted either directly or indirectly as wrong views. 

Wrong view cannot be lead to liberation. 

There is only one right view, and that is the view of dependent origination.

Dear Kathy:

You need a teacher. There are many qualified Nyingma masters who will teach qualified students the highest teaching of the Buddha, the complete path of Dzogchen, including Thogal. 

I suggest you make a connection with such a teacher. Qualified teachers like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, Chokyi Nyima, Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Pachog Rinpoche, Tulku Sangngag, HH Shenphen Dawa Rinpoche, Tulku Dakpa, and so on can be easily met and studied with. If you want to really practice Dzogchen, true devotion to a qualified guru is a necessary precondition. Following their instructions carefully is the next step. If you do this, you will undoubtedly receive such teachings. 

If you like Bonpo teachings, you can study with a number of Bonpo Lamas as well. They also teach a complete path of Dzogchen, and guru devotion is no less important in their school.

The meaning is what is important. I used the Pali canon for convenience. But this sutta also exists in the Agamas. Statements like it exist in Mahāyāna sūtras as well. 

 Thus, your question, will a Hinayāna practitioner recognize that this as a reference to tathāgatagarbha, no. But that is not important since we in Mahāyāna understand the meaning of Agamas, etc., from the point of view of Mahāyāna, not from the point of view of Hinayāna. 

I cited the Pali text to show a continuity in Buddha's teaching about the luminosity of the mind, which is an important connecting thread between Buddha's Hinayāna teachings and his Mahāyāna teachings.

Moksha is a word that means liberation. Most Indian schools— of six orthodox darshanas Mimamsa being the only exception— propose a theory of liberation. 

Buddhadharma however rejects all of these as leading to true liberation, asserting the result of these schools is rebirth in a deva realm (at best), rather than the ending of birth in samsara.

You actually want me to run through the list of anti-theist and anti-nihilist arguments you know perfectly well. What is the point? 

The point I am making is that we can see over and over again the Buddhas stating unequivocally that outside his Dharmavinaya there is no liberation. It is not like the Buddha made coherent arguments for his case. He merely stated it was so. One either accepts his statements or not.

The principle reason of course is that the Buddha's view is dependent origination, and it is by seeing the cause of suffering and so on with respect to the three realms he attained buddhahood. 

The thing is, we have, most of us, been talking about these same issues for years. I assume, perhaps wrongly, we are for the most part familiar with the Dharma to a sufficient extent that it is not necessary to fully litigate every statement which asserts liberation from samsara is the exclusive domain of Buddhadharma.

"Buddhanature" is a name for the nature of the mind. It means since the nature of the mind, clarity and emptiness, can be found in all minds, that nature of the mind can be realized by all beings, given the proper causes and conditions. 

As to the permanence of Buddhas —&nbsp;when someone frees their mind from the afflictions that cause rebirth in samsara, and attains omniscience, that person is a buddha. Buddhas are permanent in so far as there are no conditions which can inhibit their continuums. Thus, buddhas remain in the world for as long as there are sentient beings who require their assistance, manifesting when needed. When there are no more sentient beings, there is no further need for buddhas in the world.

Basically, if you going to practice Dzogchen, you are practicing Buddhadharma. Just deal with it.

Buddhas are beyond concepts and limitations, but strangely enough, only Buddhas teach Dzogchen. 

There are many Buddhist schools that do not teach Dzogchen (most in fact) or Vajrayāna in general, but Dzogchen (and Vajrayāna) is only taught by Buddhas and those in their lineage. Dzogchen and Vajrayāna in general are Buddhadharma, and do not exist in other traditions, either on this planet or any other. 

The fact that ChNN has said that anyone can come to him and receive Dzogchen teachings has inadvertently lead to a kind of false ecumenicalism on the part of some people who really seem to have neglected important parts of their training in Dharma.

Hearing a voice, but seeing no man.—We are told by St. Paul himself (Acts 22:9) that they “did not hear the voice.” What is meant is clearly that they did not hear the words—could attach no meaning to the sounds which for Saul himself had so profound a significance. So, in like manner, they saw the light, but did not see the form. In Acts 26:14, they also are said to have fallen on the ground in terror.

After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born."

For example, it is clearly explained in the commentary of the song I quoted that Goraksha attained awakening.

Siddhis are not representative of the attainment of realization (in the Buddhist sense of the term). The corollary is that those who are realized (in the Buddhist sense of the term) do not necessarily attain siddhis.  

So why should we care whether Jesus walked on water or not. There is not one thing we have a record of him saying which would indicate that he was anything other than a charismatic rabbi and a political threat to the Roman occupation of Judea.

If the guru in question merely goes insane, harmlessly, yes, the student is still bound by samay. If the guru begins to break his own samaya by harming others, going against the Dharma, repudiating the Dharma, etc., then the student is free of samaya. For example if some guru starts claiming they have a teaching more profound than the Buddhadharma, this would be a clear sign that it is ok to exit.

Any teaching you can receive directly from an authentic terton will have the most blessings, especially if they are still living. Any recent terma which has as short alineage as possible will have more blessings than a longer one. For example, these days people practice Putri Repung as the sadhana, on the basis of Namchag Putri, which has many instructions. 

With respect to older termas, and traditions, the problem is mainly that accumulation of broken samaya in the lineage overtime. On the other hand, if you receive an older terma or teaching on Lamdre for example, from a highly realized person, then it is the same as receiving a fresh terma. However, it is axiomatic that a terton is a highly realized person.

"Samaya" basically means "coming to a mutual understanding , agreement , compact , covenant , treaty , contract , arrangement , engagement , stipulation , conditions of agreement, terms."

It is rooted in a notion of contractual obligation which results when two people agree on something. In this case, before a guru offers an empowerment, the disciple has to agree to some terms in order to enter the mandala for which the teacher is giving an empowerment. The teacher also has obligations which he or she must fulfill in order to be able to offer than empowerment. 

This is the base level definition of samaya. There are much deeper understandings, like the four unbreakable samayas of the Great Perfection.

In other words, Sogyal's activities are rather paltry by comparison. Just because I voice a criticism of Dzongsar's statement published on Facebook, does not mean I do not recognize or support his other contributions to the Dharma. 

But if I see bullshit, I will call it bullshit, even it if was said by the Buddha himself. We do not have sacred cows in Buddhadharma.
