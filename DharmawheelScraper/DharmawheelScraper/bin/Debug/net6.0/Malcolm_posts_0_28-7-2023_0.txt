Nah, it just substitutes one unwieldy theory of karma and its ripening for another one. 

If a vasana merely reproduces itself in the mind stream, waiting to meet special condition for the arising of its result, this is similar to asserting that a rice seed merely reproduces itself until it meets water, mud, and sunshine. 

If one asserts the trace itself remains in the mindstream unchanged, one has to then create a theory of how that trace exists in the mind as something carried by the mind. This latter theory is slightly more preferable, according to Nagārjuna, it's based on the Buddha's comment that karma is like a debt that exists until it is paid. But even this theory won't hold up to analysis. So in the end we are left with the the fact that karma is just an illusion created by an illusion, just as Nagārjuna states in the MMK.

Matylda seems to have a valid point, based in text criticism. Instead of weariness, it should be confirmed, for example, when did the word "kensho" begin to be used in the modern manner and who was largely responsible for this. 

These kinds of issues spring up in studying Nyingma literature written prior to the 13th century, and after, following Longchenpa's synthesis of Nyingma Vajrayāna teachings with Kadampa influences in his Great Chariot, which is the dominate approach today in the Nyingma school.

Title: Tasting Sugar
Content:
The issues you raise, Clyde, are not just in Zen. The issues you raise are endemic in Western Budddhism. Why? In general if you make light of yourself, in Asia everyone will think maybe you have depth you are hiding. In America, and to a lesser extent in Europe, if you don't loudly proclaim who you are, set out your achievements and qualifications, if you tell people that you really don't have any qualities, Western people, especially Americans, will believe you and move on. There is a saying in Tibet, "An empty bucket makes the most noise." 

It's really easy to talk about sugar to someone who has not tasted it. You can use all kinds of words. However none of them will permit the person to have insight into what it tastes like. And worse, people can use these words to deceive those who have never tasted sugar (including themselves) into believing that the person describing sugar (which they have never tasted) has actually tasted sugar, selling sugar substitutes, such as saccharine and aspartame. 

Ordinary students who have never tasted sugar will never be able tell who has tasted sugar just because some teacher with a name proclaims everywhere, "I have tasted sugar!" advertising their retreats and seminars to the Tricyle/Lion's Roar/ Patreon/Wisdom/Shambhala audience. There is no guarantee that such a person who is advertising some brand of sugar has actually tasted the sugar they are selling, even when they claim someone else signed off on their sales license. Realization, whatever word you use for it, kensho, satori, rig pa, is not something which one can successfully discuss with people who do not have that experience. If one is not a teacher, one should not really try to either.

People who have had that experience recognize that trying to convey this experience in words is fraught with peril, that it can be misleading. Meido mentions this in his brief discourse on kensho, offering a disclaimer to those listening, by saying that it is easier to say what kensho isn't then what it is: 

https://www.patreon.com/posts/about-kensho-46557679

All I can say is that those who have tasted sugar can identify those who have not tasted sugar by how the latter describe it to the former. When two people who have tasted sugar get together however, they don't really need to say very much at all to recognize each other. 

For example, in the Tibetan Dzogchen tradition, it is traditionally kept very secret. Why? Not because of national security, not because it is a trade secret, and not because it is reserved for a special, elite grade of practitioners. Dzogchen has been kept secret, because like Zen, it is not realizable through intellectual analysis--it is experiential from beginning to end. And it is very easy to see in discussions who has some realization of Dzogchen teachings and who doesn't. The problem is that people can deceive others by using words and concepts found in Dzogchen texts, and the same applies to Zen/'Chan, Mahāmudra, etc. They can fool people with lineages, titles, status, certifications, and large retinues. 

There is also no guarantee that a person who has tasted sugar is going to be someone we like, someone we can relate to, someone who makes us comfortable and relieves our stress. It's very likely quite the opposite, that person will make us feel very uncomfortable, and we will have a hard time relating to that person. Why? Because the job of such a person is to show us our own state, and just as everyone hates the sound of their own voice, looking at our own state is not comfortable. 

Sometimes students feel that when a teacher goes out of the way to make them feel uncomfortable, acts strangely, and so on, this is "crazy wisdom". There are many so-called teachers who hide behind unconventional behavior because they have no realization at all. Its all just Dharma business, and making students feel unbalanced, insecure, and afraid is often the best way to gaslight them. 

But a real teacher who is making us feel uncomfortable, out of our zone, does not need to do anything obviously outrageous, all they need to do is keep telling us, "That's not sugar," "Nope, that's not sugar either," until we discover what sugar actually tastes like. Sometimes helping us taste sugar feels very extreme, causes us to have doubts about what we are doing. 

Then finally, say someone has satori, kensho, discovers rigpa, identifies the nature of the mind. So what? This is the beginning of the actual path. Now they actually have something to work with other than confusion. Now they have less doubt. But if they do not have a qualified teacher, someone who has actually tasted sugar, then they will never know if they have tasted sugar or instead tasted saccharine or aspartame.  Anyone who has tasted sugar immediately knows that saccharine, aspartame, while both sweet, taste nothing like sugar. But working with such a teacher is a two way street. The teacher has to trust the student, otherwise, they may not feel comfortable if the student is just a kind of dharma junkie, go to this teacher and that teacher, this teacher and tradition, chasing concepts and not gnosis. So in this case the teacher may not open up right away, show their hand as someone who actually has been tasting sugar for some time. See, it is not enough to taste sugar once. One has to make sure. One has to also sample sugar against sugar substitutes so one can make sure.

Also, it stands to reason that a realized Zen teacher who can know what other Zen teachers are realized,  they should also be able to know teachers in other traditions who are realized, since one assumes all Mahayana Buddhist realization is basically the same. The same goes for a realized teacher in any Mahayana tradition. The problem is that students are incapable of knowing who is and who is not realized.

The point is very simple, how does anyone know anyone is realized? There is certainly no way for an ordinary student to tell. This being the case, how are we to know who is a realized Zen master, Lama, etc? It’s not like there is some external sign or verbal indication of realization. This is why lineage is more important than the individual teacher, and that’s true in every authentic Buddhist tradition.

Given the number of Japanese Zen teachers who have proven to be absolute shitshows in America, and who have “confirmed “ their students, not to mention Tibetans, Koreans, and so on, even the safeguard of lineage is questionable.

In reality, one puts away silly romantic ideas about realized teachers, finds a compatible person to study and practice with who at least has a valid lineage, and you follow the Dharma, not the person: the meaning, not the words; definitive texts rather than provisional ones; and gnosis rather than concepts, as the Buddha recommended.

Because of Putin's attack on Ukraine, NATO has in the last year admitted two countries that have been historically neutral for decades: Finland and Sweden. Putin has succeeded only in strengthening NATO. 

Personally, I support Ukraine %100 percent in their fight against the genocidal ambitions of Putin. Putin is destroying his own country to fight a war he has no hope of winning, whether or not he decides to use nuclear weapons.

As for Taiwan. The PRC just likes to saber rattle. Right now China is in the middle of a huge economic crisis, with 20% unemployment, rampant inflation, etc. They are not going to go to war against Taiwan anytime soon. If they do, they too will lose.

Looks like there is a bit of unconscious white supremacy in your point of view:

"American Soto Zen may be seen as a distinct tradition."

"Cheah draws from critical race theory to illuminate a legacy of Orientalism and white supremacy from the Western Orientalists of the Victorian era to the contemporary Vipassana movement. Cheah borrows from Lori Pierce to define white supremacy as “the conscious or unconscious promotion and advancement of the beliefs, practices, values and ideals of Euroamerican White culture, especially when those cultural values are represented as normal.”95 As a largely invisible hegemonic discourse, white supremacy operates as a standard of normality in convert lineages. For example, bell hooks has discussed how African Americans feel marginalized in white convert communities, and for some, participating within them “has been synonymous with choosing whiteness.”96 Both Cheah and hooks argue that white supremacy, as an unconscious cultural discourse, has largely shaped Euro-American convert communities. 

Crucial to Cheah’s argument is the distinction made by Michael Omi and Howard Winant between cultural and racial rearticulation.97 Cheah extends their work to define “cultural rearticulation” as “a way of representing religious tradition from another’s culture into ideas and practices that are familiar and meaningful to people of one’s own culture.”98 Such a process is inevitable when religions travel across cultural contexts, and examples from Buddhist history include the sinicization of Buddhism in China. By contrast, “racial rearticulation” is “the acquisition of the beliefs and practices of another’s religious tradition and infusing them with new meanings derived from one’s own culture in ways that preserve the prevailing system of racial hegemony.”

Gleig, Ann. American Dharma . Yale University Press. Kindle Edition. 

I think you need to think about this in relation to your dialogue with Matylda. Specifically, she is critiquing the Zen that came to America as a trend that grew out of the Buddhism Modernism period in Japan. She is pointing out, that in her opinion, what passes for Zen in the West, largely has nothing to with actual Zen, by and large. 

Robert Sharf offers a close examination of the historical and ideological emergence of New Buddhism, the distinctively Japanese iteration of Buddhist modernism.36 The early years of the Meiji period (1868–1912) witnessed dramatic political and cultural changes and rapid modernization and industrialization. Against this backdrop, Shinto government officials mounted a strong campaign called “abolishing Buddhism” against the Tokugawa Buddhist establishment. They accused Japanese Buddhism of being both antimodern—institutionally corrupt, superstitious, and holding Japan back from scientific advancement—and anti nationalist—a foreign religious import that did not reflect the innate cultural and spiritual sensibilities of the Japanese.37 

In response to the dual challenges of Shinto government opposition and Western discourses of modernity, a group of elite, university-educated Japanese Buddhists fashioned a distinctively modern form of Buddhism. They admitted that Buddhism had become corrupt but attributed this to institutional and cultural accretions that had distorted the pure spiritual core of the tradition. In what came to be known as the New Buddhism, reformers presented a picture of a pure Buddhism that was rational, empirical, and compatible with modern science and social reform...

Sharf points out that the typically cosmopolitan and intellectual proponents of New Buddhism were educated at universities that were highly influenced by modern Western discourses, and he identifies the determinative influence of Romantic critiques of institutional religion and Enlightenment values of universalism, science, and reason.40 He claims, for example, that the framing of Zen as “pure experience” reflected the understanding in the works of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Rudolph Otto, and William James of the core of religion as a sui generis unmediated experience. This Western-influenced reconstruction of Zen as pure spirituality was then presented to unsuspecting Westerners as an historically authentic picture of Zen, which, moreover, was claimed to be superior to Christianity. According to Sharf, therefore, Meiji Buddhist reform figures subversively appropriated key values of Western modernity to form a modern picture of Zen that was used to challenge the religious and cultural hegemony of the West.41 

Sharf has shown that the New Buddhism was distinct from traditional or classical Zen on multiple levels. He disputes the notion of a “pure experience” that can be uncoupled from its institutional and doctrinal constraints, noting that classical Zen is one of the most scholastic and ritualistic forms of Buddhist monasticism and that enlightenment in Zen is “constituted in elaborately choreographed and eminently public ritual performance.”42 He has also questioned the legitimacy of New Buddhist proponents, pointing out that they were largely laypeople who were not trained in traditional Zen monastic settings. Nonetheless, this modernist vision of Zen was largely embraced by Western scholars and lay practitioners as an historically accurate picture of traditional Zen until recent studies such as Sharf’s illuminated its specifically modernist and nationalist contextual origins.43

Gleig, Ann. American Dharma . Yale University Press. Kindle Edition.

This "modern picture of Zen that...used to challenge the religious and cultural hegemony of the West" was imported to the West, and because it was largely informed by Western ideals, "This Western-influenced reconstruction of Zen as pure spirituality was then presented to unsuspecting Westerners as an historically authentic picture of Zen."

I would argue it is not the case that experience and awareness are phenomenologically distinct. If we are color-blind for example, we cannot experience certain colors. so we are not aware of them. Same goes for certain kinds of deafness. 

In deep sleep, our brains switch to delta waves. In this state we are not aware of the outside world nor do we "experience" it. If we are woken from deep sleep, we are generally startled awake. Experience is only conscious, never unconscious.

Yes. Categorically. If they are aware when they are asleep, it isn't deep sleep. Not only that, people can claim anything. But how can one test the claim, "I am continuously aware in a state of deep sleep"?

I’m unconvinced that humans will exist in a thousand years without radical changes. It seems foolhardy to assume that watching one’s breath will have any systemic effect on climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, or mass environmental devastation. As for changing the pluto- cratic control of government, finance, and the media by corporations — or ending unemployment, inequality, homelessness, substance abuse, or white supremacy — it seems almost mean to suggest that paying attention will wave magic wands. 

Ironically, Kabat-Zinn’s ideas about future deliverance distract us from what the present most requires of us: political engagement. As the University of Chicago’s Lauren Berlant notes: “Optimism is cruel when the object/scene that ignites a sense of possibility actually makes it impossible to attain the expansive transformation for which a person or a people risks striving.”5 Dissent is often stifled by fixation on the moment, letting go of “doing,” and thoughts about action. Instead, we are told to retreat to unstable conditions, indulging in what Berlant calls “conventional good-life fantasies.” Mindfulness is all very well as a basic coping device, but as a revolutionary strategy it seems empty, tempting its adherents with the comforting impasse of passivity.

You are just unconscious:

When one is awake and aware, one's brain is very active.

It is a rare vice president that does anything memorable while in office. Can you remember anything Dan Quail did? How about Al Gore? Richard Nixon under Eisenhower?, and who was LBJ's vice president? 

As for Biden, he is one of the most effective presidents we have had in decades. You should look at his legislative accomplishments, not his posture.

No, when you are unconscious, for example in deep sleep, you are also unaware.

In the context of English, the term refers to being vigilant:

Middle English aware, from late Old English gewær "watchful, vigilant," from Proto-Germanic *ga-waraz (source also of Old Saxon giwar, Middle Dutch gheware, Old High German giwar, German gewahr), from *ga-, intensive prefix, + *waraz "wary, cautious" (from PIE root *wer- (3) "perceive, watch out for").

This is quite far from the preferable translation of rig pa as "cognizance:"

cognizance (n.)
mid-14c., conisance, "device or mark by which something or someone is known," from Anglo-French conysance "recognition," later, "knowledge," from Old French conoissance "acquaintance, recognition; knowledge, wisdom" (Modern French connaissance), from past participle of conoistre "to know," from Latin cognoscere "to get to know, recognize," from assimilated form of com "together" (see co-) + gnoscere "to know" (from PIE root *gno- "to know").

Meaning "knowledge by observation or notice, understanding, information" is from c. 1400. In law, "the exercise of jurisdiction, the right to try a case" (mid-15c.). Meaning "acknowledgment, admission" is from 1560s. The -g- was restored in English spelling 15c. and has gradually affected the pronunciation, which was always "con-." The old pronunciation lingered longest in legal use.
