Needless to say, there is no need for two stages in Dzogchen.

I don’t find evaluating Dharma in terms of the three turnings to be useful—there is no agreement on it among different scholars. For example, as I read the sole brief passage the doctrine is based on, it defines the third as merely a reemphasis of the second.

Topological arguments are very weak.  Communism also looks like a religion. So does the military in every country. Government processes of legislation look like religions too, with rituals, ceremonies, and unfounded beliefs.

You just stated, in a very prolix fashion, what I just said. Talk about playing with labels. In any case. Speaking strictly for myself, Buddhadharma us not a religion, philosophy, or belief. It’s direct knowledge of one’s own state.

It is quite fair to say so, since the understanding of a direct negation in Dzogchen is not understood in the same way as in say, Tsongkhapa. For Tsongkhapa, the direct negation of inherent existence alone, is the example ultimate. Where as we see above, Dzogchen and Prasanga are alike in negating all four extremes both in the relative and the ultimate without positing something in their place [the middle is also directly negated as well]. Longchepa's statement above (naked, originally pure vidyā—neither provable nor negatable—made into the basis) is an echo of Rongzom's chapter four of Intro to Mahāyāna Systems, devoted to proving that while Dzogchen cannot be proven through reasoning, neither can it be negated through reasoning.

Ini Dzogchen, as explained by Rongzom, a direct negation is something used to refute an opponent's position without having a position to support. An implicative negation is used to defend one's position. 

Neither Dzogchen nor classical Madhyamaka (free from the Tibetan novelties of Dolbupa, Tsongkhapa, and so on) have a position to defend.

Yes, which means you have a total duality here since these are considered to be substantially different. 

In Dzogchen, ye shes is regarded as the being the basis for sems. While sems is regarded as a obscuration to be given up, it is not regarded as a substantially different entity since it arises out of the  potential (rtsal) of ye shes, manifesting as play (rol pa, dualism).  Longchenpa points out:

In addition, all phenomena of samsara depend on the mind, so when the essence of mind is purified, samsara is purified. Since the phenomena of nirvana depend on the pristine consciousness of vidyā, because one remains in the immediacy of vidyā, buddhahood arises on its own...

The essence of mind is the radiance of vidyā which is mounted on the vāyu. The essence of vidyā is intrinsically clear without vāyu (the pristine consciousness vāyu of purified karmavāyu free from coming and going)

Buddhism can be a philosophy, or a science, or a religion. It really depends on who you are and what your expectations are. For example, HHDL said, "Buddhism is more than a religion. It is a science of the mind."

The answer is that Buddhism has elements that are religious, elements that are philosophical, elements that are contemplative, elements that are cultural, elements that are ethical, and so on, and people become involved in Buddhadharma because of interest in all, several or one of these elements.

Clearly one does not need a teacher, example, pratyekabuddhas. And you do not need a teacher to tell you are suffering, anymore than you need a doctor to tell you that you are ill. In both cases one discovers one has a problem, and then one seeks a remedy. But this is not necessarily a religious quest, actually, it is just a change in attitude that results in the cessation of suffering. Therefore, Buddhadharma cannot really be called a religion, since one never depends on external causes to remove internal suffering.

A shared karmic perspective does not negate the liquid substance that is perceived differently in the six lokas. Otherwise, many faults ensue, such as the mind having color and shape, etc. Phenomena are ultimately devoid of characteristics, but in Dzogchen teachings, the view of conventionality in general is the same as Prasanga.

No, since Dzogchen does not negate outer phenomena. The subsiding of mind and mental factors has nothing to do with outer phenomena, unless you take the view that outer phenomena are nothing other than mind and mental factors, a perspective Longchenpa absolutely rejects. 

To say the ultimate is empty of relative phenomena is to claim there is an ultimate which exists outside phenomena, it’s akin to claiming that wetness exists separately from water or heat from fire. In fact no ultimate can be established apart from relative phenomena at all, since the ultimate is just seeing the suchness of phenomena, as Candrakirti states, all things have two natures, one seen correctly, the other not.

I am not really qualified to comment on Zen, one way or other. However, this passage by Dogen really strikes me as a beautiful expression of realization, right up there with some of Longchenpa's writings:

BUDDHA DHARMA CANNOT be known by a person. For this reason, since olden times no ordinary person has realized buddha dharma; no practitioner of the Lesser Vehicles has mastered buddha dharma. Because it is realized by buddhas alone, it is said [in the Lotus Sutra], “Only a buddha and a buddha can thoroughly master it.” 

When you realize buddha dharma, you do not think, “This is realization just as I expected.” Even if you think so, realization inevitably differs from your expectation. Realization is not like your conception of it. Accordingly, realization cannot take place as previously conceived. When you realize buddha dharma, you do not consider how realization came about. Reflect on this: what you think one way or another before realization is not a help for realization. 

Although realization is not like any of the thoughts preceding it, this is not because such thoughts were actually bad and could not be realization. Past thoughts in themselves were already realization. But since you were seeking elsewhere, you thought and said that thoughts cannot be realization. 

However, it is worth noticing that what you think one way or another is not a help for realization. For this reason, you become cautious not to be small-minded. Indeed, if realization came forth by the power of your prior thoughts, it would not be trustworthy. 

Realization does not depend on thoughts, but comes forth far beyond them; realization is helped only by the power of realization itself. Know that then there is no delusion, and there is no realization.

Yes, this is based precisely on the distinction between sems and ye shes. 

The most direct way to discover this stage of contemplation is to receive the rig pa'i rtsal dbang, and apply semzins and rushan on the basis of having received the rig pa'i rtsal dbang.
